    "## Description\n",
    "This version of the notebook extracts groups of pages from mongodb by firm_name to create firm-centric <b>about</b> page output files that can later be topic modeled.  In doing so, it removes repetitive content (e.g., repeated menu items) and garbage content (e.g., improperly parsed HTML code). \n",

    "* Whole process: get data, topic model and see if it looks sufficiently interesting/different\n",
