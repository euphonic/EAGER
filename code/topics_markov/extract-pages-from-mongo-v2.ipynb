    "This notebook extracts groups of pages from mongodb by firm_name to create firm-centric page output files that can later be topic modeled.  In doing so, it removes repetitive content (e.g., repeated menu items) and garbage content (e.g., improperly parsed HTML code). \n",

    "## Change log\n",
    "v2 fixes some bugs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## TODO:\n",
    "* Need to make better use of all pages in the site, e.g., to improve data quality and use additional paragraph data found on non-homepages "
