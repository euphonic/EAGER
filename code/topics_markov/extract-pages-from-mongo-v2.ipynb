    "This notebook extracts groups of pages from mongodb by firm_name to create firm-centric page output files that can later be topic modeled.  In doing so, it removes repetitive content (e.g., repeated menu items) and garbage content (e.g., improperly parsed HTML code). \n",

    "v2 fixes some bugs.  \n",

    "* Need to make better use of all pages in the site, e.g., to improve data quality and use additional paragraph data found on non-homepages "
