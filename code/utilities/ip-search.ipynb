      "Therefore, Mr. Pandolfino concluded, the key to producing a cigarette with virtually no nicotine – that smokers would find acceptable – is the ability to grow tobacco plants whose intrinsic nicotine content is a tiny fraction of that found in conventional tobacco plants. This conclusion led Mr. Pandolfino on a journey to acquire and develop the know-how and technology, including intellectual property rights, to block nicotine biosynthesis in the tobacco plant through genetic engineering.\n",

      "To this end, in 1997 Mr. Pandolfino met Dr. Mark Conkling, Director of the Biotechnology Programs at North Carolina State University. Dr. Conkling had recently cloned a key gene in the tobacco plant responsible for nicotine production. Dr. Conkling believed expression of this gene could be blocked to produce tobacco plants with virtually no nicotine. Mr. Pandolfino concurred and the result of their meeting was a successful 5-year research collaboration between and that resulted in a patented very low nicotine tobacco variety (Xie et al. 2004). This became the first genetically modified (GM) tobacco variety deregulated by the Animal Plant & Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).\n",

The technology and exclusive related patent rights obtained from and are keystones of Century’s intellectual property, representing the company’s second-generation technology that has significant advantages over the earlier technology licensed to Liggett Group and Vector Tobacco.

      "Danazol is an established, synthetic derivative of modified testosterone ethisterone that affects vascular endothelial cell linkage in a biphasic manner. Ultra-low dose danazol (as formulated in Optina) decreases vascular permeability by increasing the barrier function across endothelial cells, indicating the potential to treat multiple angiopathies. Further, danazol increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels through the rapid activation of membrane-associated androgen, steroid binding globulin, and calcium channel receptors. With the ultra-low dose contained in our novel Optina formulation, danazol binds to androgen and steroid binding globulin receptors stimulating the formation of a cortical actin ring to enhance endothelial cell barrier function. When organized into a cortical ring, filamentous actin (f-actin) increases the barrier function of endothelial cells by tethering adhesion molecule complexes to the cytoskeleton. In this orientation, increased cortical actin improves tight junctions which strengthen cell-to-cell adhesions, thereby restricting leakage (edema) across the cell membrane. large, late-stage clinical trial is identified to start in the for the oral treatment of diabetic macular edema. Additional future indications for Optina are being researched. One hundred thirty four patents are currently issued for Optina with 50 pending applications worldwide.\n",

Ray Stanton (“Stan”) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry. With a few simple materials—primarily used machine parts and a saber saw—Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information. In 1990, International merged with Manufacturing to become Dennison. Today, we manufacture and distribute labeling and packaging materials in over 50 countries and employ more than 30,000 people. The flexibility and responsiveness afforded by our company's global footprint enables us to service our customers at key points throughout their supply chain. In just over 80 years we have grown from one bright idea into a global that continues to set new standards for quality and innovation in materials science.\n",

      "On December 7, 1890, Chester Odin Wanvig, the first president of Globe-Union (the ancestor to Controls' Power Solutions Business Unit), was born in Milwaukee.  Chester's father was John Wanvig, a Norwegian immigrant who was widely known as a master of ships which plied the Great Lakes.  As a boy, Chester worked his way up from deckhand to wheelsman on his father's coal and ore ship, and also sold newspapers.  He went on to attend the Michigan College of Mines at Houghton for a time, but left to clerk at a steel company.  At the age of 20, Chester became general manager and secretary of the Wallace Smith Co., then the nation's largest manufacturer of saddlery.  After gaining financial control of the company, he liquidated it in the early 1920s and subsequently purchased (with his brother) the Globe Electric Company.  Globe's 1925 purchase of Central Radio Laboratories (later known as Centralab) proved fortuitous in that it immediately preceded the radio craze that would sweep America.  Also, about this time, Wanvig formed Union Battery to serve as a supplier to Sears.  In 1929, the assets of Globe Electric and Union Battery were consolidated and the Globe-Union Manufacturing was organized.  Automotive batteries came to represent Globe's major success, much of which was owed to Globe's engineers and their patented equipment and processes.  Under Wanvig, growth continued apace, with sales of batteries, Centralab electronic components, roller skates, and spark plugs reaching $50 million by 1955.  Wanvig was president of Globe-Union until 1949, chairman of the board from 1949 to 1953, and from 1954 to 1958 he served as both board chairman and president.  Upon Wanvig's retirement in 1958, his son, Chester Wanvig, Jr., became president of Globe-Union.  Wanvig, Jr. was still at the helm of Globe-Union in 1978 when it was acquired by Controls.\n",

Ron’s passion for photovoltaic technology started in the early 1970’s in the solar cell industry in the greater Chicago area.

In the early days, focused on technologies and packaging them into systems for the medical industry.  With early success established it headquarters in Barneveld,  With the new facility came the addition of a class 1,000 clean room and multiple patents on photovoltaic technologies.  One of these breakthroughs was an encoder photodiode technology.  This technology was not widely accepted in the industry at first.  So in true Ron fashion, “if encoder companies don’t want to use our superior sensing technology, we will.”  In 1999 became an encoder manufacturer.  Early growth was contributed to the industries 1st fundamental read 5000 line count encoder in a 1.5″ package.
