# The Web of Innovation: Using Website Data to Understand How Firms Innovate

Thanks for visiting this GitHub site!  I am PI on a small NSF grant and this code and data are available to anyone who wants to use or extend the repo to study small firm innovation.  Before you read further, I suggest reading the companion site @ https://www.dextr.us/nsf-eager.  Here you'll find some background on why I started this work, as well as links to some other helpful resources, including a workshop that is aimed at a pedagogical introduction to the method.
