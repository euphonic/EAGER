"Most side effects of radiotherapy, including radiotherapy delivered with systems, are mild and temporary, often involving fatigue, nausea, and skin irritation. Side effects can be severe, however, leading to pain, alterations in normal body functions (for example, urinary or salivary function), deterioration of quality of life, permanent injury and even death. Side effects can occur during or shortly after radiation treatment or in the months and years following radiation. The nature and severity of side effects depend on many factors, including the size and location of the treated tumor, the treatment technique (for example, the radiation dose), the patient‚Äôs general medical condition, to name a few.

The Department of Energy explored this concept through the Aquatic Species Program (ASP) from the late 1970s until 1996.  When the program ended, oil was ~$20/barrel, making renewable energy generally, and algae-derived fuels in particular, uneconomic.  The concluded that producing biofuels from microalgae was feasible; however technology at that time did not allow for economic viability.",1

"Through technologically advanced innovative systems, is able to infuse billions of 4-to-6 nanometer sized diamonds into oils.  Nano diamond material at this size functions like ball bearings by transforming the sliding friction that normally occurs between metal surfaces into rolling friction, thereby substantially reducing friction, heat, wear and early oil failure.",1
Over 8 years of research and development have created the next generation of ‚ÄúInnovations for Lubricants‚Äù.  Our patented nano diamond technology completely revolutionizes lubricant performance.,1
"Even though diamonds are considered one of the hardest substances known to man, at nanometer size they actually polish and keep debris from attaching to the metal.  Each nano diamond is encapsulated in oil and while residing in the pores of the metal, they help seal out moisture and debris that would otherwise attack metal surfaces. Unlike Molybdenum, Graphite, or other additives being used today, nano diamonds will not break down or flatten out during use.  That is why using nano diamond products will help protect the metal surfaces of your engines, equipment and other machinery.",1

"Revivicor?¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s product development pipeline addresses focus areas of large unmet clinical need and thus large commercial markets. For diabetes, there are currently 3 million patients in the with Type1 diabetes, on insulin, who could be transplanted now, if not for the dire shortage of donor tissue. At $20,000 net sales per transplant, this is a projected $60 billion market. Recently published results demonstrated that pancreatic islet cells from pigs, when transplanted into diabetic monkeys, cured diabetes for over 1 year with complete normalization of blood glucose levels ( van der Windt et al., 2009 ). The pigs used in these studies were engineered such that a human gene (?¢‚Ç¨?ìCD46?¢‚Ç¨Ôø?) was added, and a key pig gene (alpha-Gal) was deleted, as a means to overcome transplant rejection issues. It is anticipated that insulin-producing islet cells from Revivicor?¢‚Ç¨‚Ñ¢s cloned pigs could be in human clinical trials within 3 years time.",1

Many different approaches have been taken to get more electricity off of solar cells from moving the electrical contacts to the rear to wiring mesh interconnection to replace busbars. Solaria managed to remove busbars entirely by slicing solar cells into segments and stringing them together. This results in attaching cells with no busbars which brings more aesthetically pleasing look as well as increased efficiency.,1

"For example, if a customer pays for electricity on a time of use plan from their power company, a lighting device that stores energy when the electricity rates are low and uses the stored energy when the electricity rates are high may save money on their electric bill by using that stored power intelligently.  In a similar example, a customer can reduce the amount of power it consumes from the power company by using a local power source to power a lighting device helping the power company deal with periods of time when there is a peak in energy consumption that puts a strain on their ability to supply power.",1

Corporation‚Äôs patented Windbeam micro generator captures from airflow to recharge batteries and power electronic devices.,1
"Corporation aims to capitalize on rapid growth of the Internet of Things movement and a worldwide need for clean, renewable energy.",1
The Windbeam‚Äôs novel design allows it to operate silently in wind speeds as low as 2 mph. The generator consists of a lightweight beam suspended by durable long-lasting springs within an outer frame. The beam oscillates rapidly when exposed to airflow due to the effects of multiple fluid flow phenomena. linear alternator assembly converts the oscillating beam motion into usable electrical energy. lack of bearings and gears eliminates frictional inefficiencies and noise. The generator can operate in low-light environments unsuitable for solar panels (e.g. ducts) and is inexpensive due to low cost components and simple construction. The scalable technology can be optimized to satisfy the requirements and design constraints of a given application.,1

"The motivation for starting was the frustration had experienced as a scientist when trying to acquire high quality nanomaterials. Every time ordered a product from a nanomaterial or chemical company would spend many hours performing characterization only to realize that the shape, size distribution, agglomeration state, or chemical purity was not what was expecting. would be forced to discard the material and try another vendor. This was a time-consuming and completely unnecessary impediment to the development of technologies and products that leverage the new and exciting properties of nanomaterials.",1
