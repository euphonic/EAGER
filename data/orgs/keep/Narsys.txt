Realtime Drainage Analysis
Production Guided
Founded in 2016 by Stuart Jackson, NarSysTech designs and develops self-aware technologies for the stimulation market.
NarSysTech Products are based on our patent pending Production Potential Modeling (PPM) Technology which models how a reservoirs production potential changes over time.
NarSysTech products use the to interpolate between time-lapse volumes and visualize expected drainage in real-time.

Over the past decade, drilling contractors and operators have steadily marched toward more automated drilling and completion processes and practices...
Welcome to NarSysTech
        The primary objectives of NarSysTech are to provide our clients with higher and more consistent production from every well through the early identification of by-passed pay and prediction of pressure anamolies that are caused by assymetrical drainage. This is accomplished through with our patent pending Production Potential Modeling (PPM) engine which is at the core of all of our product offerings.
