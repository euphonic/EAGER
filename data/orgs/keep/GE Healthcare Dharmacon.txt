As leaders in custom synthesis, Dharmacon, Inc. was an early participant in the newly discovered field of interference, and contributed several key scientific findings and some of the first commercially available, guaranteed to-silence sireagents. This leadership continued through technical advances in bioinformatics and chemical modifications to improve performance. Today, our areas of research and research tools have expanded to support all aspects of RNAi interference; siRNA, lentiviral shRNA, tools for microresearch and genome scale libraries for RNAi functional screens of genes, microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs. For over-expression, 
has one of the largest collections of cDNAs and ORFs commercially available.
More recently, released a suite of innovative CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tools, leveraging our leadership in synthesis and vector biology, providing one of the most comprehensive genome engineering toolset available. Our approach in providing ready-to-use synthetic and lentiviral guide RNAs and Cas9 nuclease reagents greatly simplifies the selection of appropriate tools for nearly every application. Our bioinformatics expertise has resulted in the first rational design algorithm for CRISPR-Cas9 functional gene knockout, so predesigned, genome-wide guide RNAs for human, mouse, and rat are only a click away.
Inc has been assessed and holds a 
. This applies to the design and manufacture of RNA, DNA, and viral products for research and laboratory use, including interference, gene expression, and gene editing.

Open Biosystems began as an entrepreneurial start-up in the Hudson Alpha Institute of Biotechnology offering access to cDNA, and shproducts through academic partnerships.  In 2004, the company made available ground-breaking short hairpin (shRNA) libraries developed by Gregory Hannon (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories) and Steve Elled(Harvard University) targeting the human and mouse genomes. Published in Nature Genetics in 2005, the Hannon-Elledlibraries were the first genome-scale arrayed shresources modeled after primary microtranscripts to be created. Additionally, Open Biosystems entered into an agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 2005 to serve as a partner of The RNAi Consortium (TRC) and distribute the genome-wide shlibraries.
In 2007, Open Biosystems announced the first of several releases of ORFeome Collaboration Clones, sequence-verified human open reading frames (ORFs) drawn from a variety of sources, including principally the Dana Farber Cancer Institute-Center for Cancer Systems Biology. Other contributors to this worldwide collaboration included the Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) and the IMAConsortium.
All of these collections are available as part of the portfolio.

The Genomics Discovery Initiative (GDI; formerly the RNAi Global Initiative) is a global consortium of researchers who utilize RNAi and screening libraries for high-throughput functional genomics studies. Membership includes but is not limited to:
Annual in-person meetings to facilitate collaborations, share key findings and best practices
Opportunities to participate in early-access projects with tools and technologies
Private LinkedIn messaboard access for on-the-spot discussion forums, announcements, and FAQs
The results of this Initiative have been substantial; over 60 member institutes worldwide, multiple shared publications, and hundreds of published whole genome siscreens (and counting)!
The advent of CRISPR-Cas9 as a functional genomics tool has transformed the primary goals of RNAi Global and its members, from experimental screening set-up and support to incorporation of new technologies into functional genomics studies.
The community will now carry a new name, the Genomics Discovery Initiative.
Testimonials from some of our members
“RNAi Global membership has been a great help to us. Being able to attend these meetings lets us interact with these people who are doing cutting-edwork, so we can get a lot of feedback, and a lot of help in terms of setting up our screens”
“One of the nicest parts is being in contact with other groups, worldwide, we learn from their experience…[there is] a feeling of friendship that goes beyond the meetings.”            Ghil Jona, Weizmann Institute of Science
“don’t think can speak highly enough of the entire Initiative as a whole…It’s like no other vendor relationship I’ve had before. They’re not trying to sell you something, they’re working with you.” Kaylene Simpson, Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre
“Working with RNAi Global has allowed us to develop assays quicker, faster, and better.”           Ralph Tripp, University of Georgia
