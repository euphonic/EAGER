This image is expressing a typical Japanese family at a dining space in the 1950's.
The world's first application of ferrite as a ferrite core results in a dramatic reduction of noise.
Until about 1950, listening to the radio often was marred by noise and interference, and reception sensitivity was not very high.
But once ferrite cores came into use, the noise decreased and the sound became clearer, allowing more people to listen and to obtain a wide range of information.
During the postwar economic growth period in Japan, the advent of television ushered in the age of visual information.

After hard disk drives with high storage capacities were developed in the 1990s, more software such as spreadsheet or word processing programs, image processing software etc. could be installed on a single computer, and personal computers became an indispensable part of most offices.
The rapid progress towards smaller and lighter hardware with higher storage led to the spread of notebook computers.

new type of radio triggers a sudden demand for ferrite.
In 1947, just after the end of WWII, the old type of radio (4-tube radios and similar) which suffered from noisy reception was replaced by a new principle called a superheterodyne receiver, offering much better performance. However, these receivers require an intermediate frequency transformer (IFT) that in turn needs a ferrite core, and orders for ferrite suddenly started pouring in at TDK, the only ferrite manufacturer in Japan at the time. This enabled to overcome the difficulties of the postwar phase and build a solid foundation that lasts until this day. In 1955, Japan's first transistor radio hit the market. It was equipped with a bar antenna that used a ferrite core from In this way, made a significant contribution in the field of radios which were the forerunners of today's wide range of audiovisual equipment.
Various types of deflection yoke cores
Ferrite demand jumps with launch of broadcasting.
In 1950, as (Japan's national public broadcasting organization) began experimental television broadcasting, embarked on the research and development of prototype ferrite cores for the deflection yokes and flyback transformers necessary in order to display an image on a cathode-ray tube. The cores were finally ready for mass production in 1953, around the same time when regular broadcasting got under way in Japan. Some seven years later, color broadcasting was launched in 1960. In the 1980s, screens rapidly became much larger, driving the demand for more complex deflection yoke shapes and higher performance. Power ratings also increased, leading to an increase in demand for power ferrite materials to be used in transformers for switching type power supplies.
"Ulcon"
Cassette, the world's first cassette tape designed for music (1968)
Audio tape and video tape adopted by broadcasting stations
In 1950, the year the first tape recorder made in Japan was introduced, embarked on a research and development project for magnetic tape as a new business, harnessing the company's strength in magnetic materials technology. Three years later, in 1953, a magnetic tape product called "Synchrotape " for open reel tape recorders was launched. Ongoing research resulted in further refinements in terms of materials technology and manufacturing techniques. In recognition of its broadcast level performance, Synchrotape was adopted by broadcasting stations in 1957. Technical cooperation by also was instrumental in the effort to develop a locally produced video tape. In 1963, the "Synchro Video Tape" developed by was selected for use in broadcasting. At the Tokyo Olympics held in the following year, about 60 percent of the video tapes used for broadcasting applications were products.
The wider a magnetic tape, and the faster its travel speed, the more information can be recorded on it. In 1966, brought a cassette tape product called "Synchro Cassette" onto the market, but due to the narrow width of the tape and its slow speed as compared to open-reel tapes, the cassette was not suitable for music recording. In order to solve this problem, developed a new type of magnetic powder with vastly improved characteristics, which made it possible in 1968 to present the world's first cassette tape for music recording, branded as the "Cassette". With a clever sales strategy also paying off, the Cassette took the market by storm and received overwhelming feedback from users around the world. It became a monumental product that cemented the name of as the world's foremost magnetic tape manufacturer.
Contributing to TDK's image and brand recognition
The first video tape recorder (VTR) was introduced in the in 1956, but the extremely high sales price limited its appeal mainly to stations and similar. Followed by the open-reel type, the 1960s saw the introduction of cassette type video recorders (VCRs), and in the 1970s , two competing systems of more compact VCRs for household use were developed: Betamax and had already been supplying video tape as an (Original Equipment Manufacturer), but as VCRs gained in popularity, released a video tape product under its own brand name in 1978. To meet increased production capacity needs, a new plant dedicated to video tapes was constructed at Mikumagawa (Hita City, Oita Pref.) in 1982. At the time, video tape accounted for more than half of the company's entire net sales. spots and other types of advertising provided a strong boost to TDK's name recognition and significantly lifted the company's brand image.
new technology for cobalt coating the needle-shaped magnetic powder
The characteristics of the magnetic powder which is applied on the plastic base film have a vital influence on the performance of the magnetic tape. By employing a powder with extremely fine needle-shaped particles for the Cassette, was able to break through the performance barrier of cassette tapes, making them a viable music recording medium for the first time. Moving towards further advancement, perfected a new technology in 1973 for coating the surface of the needle-shaped particles with cobalt. This enabled outstanding characteristics significantly better than the chromium dioxide that was the standard for high-performance tapes at the time. The new magnetic powder called "Avilyn" became the basis for the entire range of "SA" (Super Avilyn) products for music and video. The excellent sound and image quality afforded by these tapes provided a major boost to the culture of audio and video recording.
TDK's first multilayer ceramic chip capacitor in the 4545 format (4.5 x 4.5 mm)
Multilayer chip inductors
Chip components and (Surface Mount Technology) by automated placement equipment
In the early days of electronics, most electronic components used to have long "legs" in the form of lead wires that were inserted into holes on the printed circuit board and then soldered to create a product. But in the 1970s a major innovation revolutionized the way in which electronic products were built. Very small chip-like components without lead wires are placed directly on the printed circuit board by high-speed automated pick-and-place equipment in a process that became known as (Surface Mount Technology). An ultra-thin pocket radio that came onto the market in 1976 was the very first consumer product manufactured with SMT, and it featured multilayer ceramic chip capacitors from In the course of the next decade, chip components became ever smaller, triggering an amazing reduction in size and weight of electronic products.
Chip components realized with fine multilayer technology from Inductors are normally made by winding coil wire around a magnetic core. But a breakthrough technology introduced by in 1980 made it possible for the first time to form a coil by a layering process without winding, resulting in the world's first multilayer chip inductor reaching the market. followed this up by "fine multilayering," a proprietary, highly advanced technique for simultaneous sintering of different materials such as ferrite and dielectric ceramics. Further development extended the technique to composite chip components integrating capacitor and inductor functions, and to a multilayer integrated device (MHD) comprising an All of these greatly contributed to make portable electronic devices such as video cameras and personal music players much smaller and lighter while at the same time capable of higher performance.
Multilayer ceramic chip capacitors
Alternating dielectric sheet and internal electrode in layers
Currently, more than 80% of all capacitors manufactured worldwide are multilayer ceramic chip types. single smartphone or notebook computer may contain upwards of 500 of these. The world's first multilayer ceramic chip capacitor was developed in the in the 1940s, but it saw only limited use in special military or industrial applications. Only after mass production technology had been developed in Japan in the 1970s, multilayer ceramic chip capacitors found their way into consumer products in large numbers. There are many different variations and manufacturing methods, but the basic principle involves screen-printing of the internal electrodes on a dielectric sheet, layering the result, and then cutting it into individual chips.
Applications include noise countermeasure components and circuit protection devices
The availability of electronic components in chip format since the 1980s, along with the progress of (surface mount technology) has greatly contributed to the realization of smaller, lighter, and higher functionality electronic equipment. applied its original fine multilayering technology not only to capacitors and inductors but also to various other chip type products including noise countermeasure components and circuit protection devices. Turning electronic components into chips requires highly accurate screen printing techniques, advanced processing methods, and superior materials technology. Of utmost importance is a full mastery of the entire range of electroceramic materials which includes ferrite (magnetic ceramics), dielectric ceramics, and semiconductor ceramics.
Various types of magnetic head products
Winchester head (left) and entire assembly mounted to gimbal
Ferrite magnetic heads used widely.
Magnetic materials technology from not only was crucial for the tapes used in tape recorders and VTRs, it also provided benefits in the field of magnetic heads. Ever since developing an erase head for tape recorders in 1963, has been active in the area of magnetic heads for audio applications such as cassette decks and VTRs, and in industrial applications as well, including for example heads for magnetic card readers in admission ticket vending machines and bill exchange machines. Ferrite not only provides superior magnetic characteristics, it also has excellent abrasion resistance, making it highly suitable for magnetic heads whose surface is constantly being swept by the media such as magnetic tape or cards during recording and playback.
Origins of the head core piece using ferrite
Prior to the invention of the (hard disk drive), cylindrical magnetic drums were used as storage devices for computers. TDK's magnetic head business for computers has its origins in 1960, when the company embarked on the development of a head core piece for magnetic drums, using ferrite. The product released two years later became known as the "boat shaped head core" because its cross section resembled that of a boat. To meet the demands of higher-density recording, the "2314 compatible head core piece" was developed in 1968, followed by the development of the Winchester head in 1972, providing another boost to TDK's accelerating magnetic head business.
