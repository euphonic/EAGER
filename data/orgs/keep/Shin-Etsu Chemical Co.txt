Striving to Strengthen Existing Businesses and
We are pleased to report our results for the fiscal year ended March 2018 to our shareholders. We achieved record-high profits as well as our eighth consecutive year of income growth by making every effort across our businesses. Shintech Inc., a subsidiary, significantly contributed to the record-high profits. Additionally, the semiconductor silibusiness notably boosted its results by capturing strong demand. The silicones business performed at a high level by focusing on growing sales worldwide.
Our basic dividend policy is to return the results of our businesses appropriately to our shareholders. We decided on a cash dividend of ¥140 per share for the fiscal year ended March 2018, which is a ¥20 increase from the previous year, and our third consecutive year of increased dividend payments. 
The Group continues to exert every effort to maximize our corporate value, and among these efforts we have placed a top priority on profit growth. Currently, the global economic environment is undergoing dramatic changes and is becoming more and more uncertain. Therefore, to maintain stable growth, we shall continue reinforcing our existing businesses to build a profit structure not overly dependent on any specific sector.
We have focused on our core businesses,“ PVC”,“ semiconductor silicon” and “silicones” as they have been our group's pillars of growth and have continued to exhibit our strengths in each market. However, in order to achieve even greater growth going forward, we need to strengthen each and every business. To this end, we are committed to what we do best by maintaining our basic principles, including quick decision-making, aggressive investment and the dispersion of risks.

Meeting Customer Needs with Sincerity Enabled the
year ago, mentioned to you that comparing the earnings for the last fiscal year (FY2016) with those in the fiscal year of April to March 2008, when we had a record profit, the recovery had been slightly over 80% and we were executing and planning on various initiatives to reach and exceed the record earnings. am very pleased to inform you that in this fiscal year (FY2017) we not only closed the 20% gap but also renewed the record earnings.
In FY2017 we grew the sales turnover by 13.5% over the year before (FY2016) on a local currency basis and 16.5% on a Japanese yen denominated basis. Each of the business segments achieved top-line and bottom-line growth. We worked diligently to meet our customers’ increasing needs throughout our operations. In the process, we also worked on pricing for our products so as to have prices more properly reflect value the products provide. The initiatives and efforts certainly contributed to yet another and strong double-digit increase in earnings segmentally and companywide. We increased the operating income by 41.2% to ¥336.8 billion, income before income taxes by 40.5% to ¥340.3 billion and net income by 51.3% to ¥266.2 billion. Since March, 2010, the cumulative growth in earnings was ¥213.3 billion on a pretax basis and ¥182.4 billion on an after tax basis, which equates a compound annual growth rate of 13.1% and 15.5%, respectively.
We succeeded in raising return on invested capital (ROIC) by 4.2 percent point to 18.2% and return on equity (ROE) by 3.4 percent point to 11.9%. We increased the annual dividend by 20 yen to 140 yen for FY2017. In this last May, we retired our treasury stocks in an amount equal to 1% of the outstanding shares. refer you to segmental earnings, in comparison with the FY2007.

Note: Segment categories were changed in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2011. Amounts in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2008[FY2007], were reclassified to conform to current segment categories.
We now have more balanced earnings profile than before. We are leveraging what we accomplished in this last fiscal year to raise the earnings. It is not an easy task but we are challenging ourselves to it, as we speak. We have been very busy running all the plants worldwide. We do so with our strong commitment to safety and quality. We have 20,000 motivated and dedicated people working day in day out to deliver our commitments. We invest in our employees through managerial interactions, various training programs and career development opportunities. 
While we are vigorously and attentively serving our customers' growing needs for our products, we are being engaged in a growing list of capital projects. We forecast the amount of capital investments will be 250 billion yen in FY2018, about 40% greater than FY2017. The breakdown of the forecast by segment in comparison with last year is as follows:

Market demands generated by our business activities are relayed to our development divisions, where they are used to establish research themes. The development divisions follow these themes as they progress. At the same time they maintain close ties with the manufacturing divisions and conduct practical R&aimed at utilizing our plants and facilities for mass production. In order to do this efficiently, has established R&centers at each plant, which ties them in closely with each business and manufacturing division.
Materials Development with Originality - Creating New Value
In conducting our R&D, we focus on original themes. Our first goal with these themes is to meet the next generation of needs and, secondly, show originality in doing something that has never been attempted. Some of these carefully selected themes have led to the invention of new materials that we were the first to mass produce. These materials have solved problems in various industrial fields by providing unique properties and excellent functionalities, while leading to industry-changing breakthroughs. We will continue to take on the challenge of developing new materials wherever the need exists.

Our goal - to be your best partner by always supplying the highest quality products
considers it extremely important as a materials producer to provide a stable supply of high-quality products. High purity and cleanliness are demanded from many of the products we deliver. 
To supply cutting-edge materials, our quality control technology and system must also be cutting-edge. 
To fulfill these kinds of high-level needs, is introducing the latest analytical equipment and developing its own original quality control system, while, at the same time, building a management system to enforce this function continuously and effectively. 
As our customers' best partner, we always provide a stable supply of quality products.
Chemical's adherence to quality control rooted in receipt of Deming Prize.
The Deming Prize medal
began tackling "QC" at the relatively early date of 1950, and went to work to establish quality control methods. Then, after a mere three years, it received the Deming Prize in 1953 for its efforts. The company received an appraisal from Dr. Deming himself as having "the world's highest level" of statistical quality control. Since then, has worked to develop new products while developing a system and technology to maintain and improve the quality of our previously developed products. Since 1987, when the International Standards Organization (ISO) set forth the 9000 Series of international standards for evaluation of management systems, the Group has received 9000 certification at almost all of its production facilities. In addition, Shin-Estu is regularly executing quality audits of each facility's products. We are meeting the needs of the times through unflagging pursuit of quality control.
9001 Certification of the Group(44kb)
Meeting customer's high-level needs with Shin-Etsu's Six Sigma program
, a quality control method based on statistical analysis of data which is targeted at reducing the percentage of faulty products, is attracting a great deal of attention as a new management initiative to improve quality. 
started its Six Sigma program in 2000. Shin-Etsu's Six Sigma program fuses the company's past experiences with the concepts and methods of Six Sigma. It is already steadily achieving good results.
will continue to improve quality control levels using diverse approaches, as it strives to meet the high-level needs of its customers. At the same time, will promote the raising of each and every staff members' consciousness about product quality and endeavor to enhance the productivity of all personnel.
The word "Six Sigma" is a statistical measure of faulty parts per million pieces manufactured. It refers to both products and business processes. The concept of Six Sigma signifies the attainment of a nearly perfect high-quality control level of 99.999997 percent, meaning that there are only 3.4 defects per million parts. This level has emerged as the benchmark for high quality-fewer than 3.5 defects per million.
