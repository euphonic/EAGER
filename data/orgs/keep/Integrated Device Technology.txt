IDT’s analog mixed-signal products including sensors, high performance interconnect, & optical and wireless power join Renesas’ MCUs, SoCs and power management ICs to deliver comprehensive solutions addressing the increasing demand from Ioto big data processing 
IDT’s products for memory interconnect and specialized power management enable Renesas to create growth in expanding data economy fields and to further strengthen its presence in the industrial and automotive segments
US$49.00 per share in cash to be paid for all outstanding shares, representing a premium of approximately 29.5 percent over the unaffected price of IDT’s common stock as of August 30, 2018
The transaction is expected to be highly accretive to Renesas’ pro-forma non-gross margin, non-(earnings per share) and free cash flows immediately after closing
Renesas plans to finance the transaction with cash reserves and approximately 679.0 billion yen of bank loans. There will be no issuance of additional share capital for this transaction. 
Since 2016, Renesas has been executing its growth strategy to thrive in the global marketplace and become a global leading embedded solution provider. As part of this initiative, Renesas is working to expand its analog solution lineup and to strengthen its kit solution offerings that combine its microcontrollers (MCUs), system-on-chips (SoCs) and analog products. These efforts will be underpinned by revenue growth in its focus domains: automotive segment, which is expected to see tremendous growth with autonomous driving and EV/HEV; industrial and infrastructure segments, which are expected to advance with Industry 4.0 and 5(fifth-generation) wireless communications, as well as the fast-growing Iosegment. Renesas views accretive acquisitions as key enablers in achieving this growth strategy to deliver further incremental growth. The completion of the Intersil Corporation acquisition in February 2017 enabled Renesas to add industry-leading power management and precision analog capabilities to its product portfolio. Renesas is capitalizing on the exciting opportunities in its focus business segments by offering combined solutions. The transaction announced today further accelerates Renesas’ growth strategy, bringing substantial strategic and financial benefits. 
The acquisition will provide Renesas with access to a vast array of robust analog mixed-signal capabilities in embedded systems, including RF, advanced timing, memory interface & power management, optical interconnect, wireless power, and smart sensors. The combination of these product lines with Renesas’ advanced MCUs and SoCs and power management ICs enables Renesas to offer comprehensive solutions that support the increasing demand of high data processing performance. The enriched solution offerings will bring optimal systems from external sensors through analog front-end to processors and interfaces. 
IDT’s analog mixed-signal products for data sensing, storage and interconnect are key devices that support the growth of data economy. Acquisition of these products enables Renesas to extend its reach to fast-growing data economy-related applications  including data center and communication infrastructure, and to strengthen its presence in the industrial and automotive segments. 
- Acceleration of global management and operations
The Intersil acquisition brought diverse talent and management capabilities to accelerate Renesas’ global operations. The transaction announced today extends this effort and will provide Renesas with further proficiency to execute global strategy. 
Renesas anticipates near- and long-term revenue growth from expanded opportunities and access to fast-growing industries, and cost savings from a greater scale business platform to bring innovation and improvements with an expected financial impact of approximately over US$250 million (non-operating income per year on a run rate basis). The transaction is expected to be accretive to Renesas’ non-gross margin and non-earnings per share by approximately 1.6%pts and 18% (Note), respectively, immediately after closing. 
"This acquisition will bring us complementary, market-leading analog mixed-signal assets and an incredibly talented group of professionals to help us boost our embedded solution capabilities," said Bunsei Kure, Representative Director, President and of Renesas. “IDT’s products combined with our MCUs, SoCs and power management ICs will enable Renesas to widen its product offerings as well as to expand its reach into areas such as the growing data economy-related space.” 
“The combination of Technology’s analog mixed-signal leadership with Renesas’ world-leading microcontroller and automotive/industrial franchise creates a new global powerhouse,” said Gregory Waters, President and of “The Combined company will possess the key capabilities that customers in the modern data economy demand.”
shares are to be acquired at a price of US$49.00 per share, for a total equity value of approximately US$6.7 billion (approximately ¥733.0 billion at an exchange rate of 110 yen to the dollar). Renesas plans to finance the transaction with cash reserves and approximately 679.0 billion yen of bank loans. Renesas does not intend to raise equity financing for this transaction.
