Leading the sustainable industrial revolution™
was founded by Marshall Medoff with the vision of increasing the world’s available sustainable resources.
Non-food biomass waste is plentiful and renewable.
In order to create a sustainable resource from biomass, it is necessary to change the molecular structure into a new material.  Centuries of scientific effort have failed to find commercially viable way to do that.
Mr. Medoff carefully studied this science problem. Inspired by natural forces including light and solar energy, he ultimately innovated and patented sustainable technologies that cleanly and inexpensively restructure biomass into a new material with a changed molecular structure.
The sugars obtained from this new material produce a wide range of downstream building block products, as well as intermediate and final products to inexpensively house, feed, medicate, clothe and provide clean energy and the other necessaries, and together create a trillion-dollar global product market.
has established a multi-billion dollar valuation.
Mr. Medoff’s Natural Force® technologies represent a transformative ethical and scientific breakthrough that use only non-food sources, significantly reduce the world’s greenhouse gas emissions and significantly increase the world’s sustainable resources. For example, Xyleco’s ethanol is estimated to reduce greenhouse gasses by better than 70%. For more information click here .
