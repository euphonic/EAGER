Richard Hynes, PhD, FRS
Koch Institute and Department of Biology at MIT, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Broad Institute
Richard Hynes is the Daniel Ludwig Professor for Cancer Research at the Koch Institute and Department of Biology at MIT, Investigator of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Senior Associate Member of the Broad Institute.  He was formerly Associate Head and then Head of the Biology department and was Director of the Center for Cancer Research (now the Koch Institute) for 10 years.  He is a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) of London and a Member of the National Academies of Sciences and Medicine, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Academy.
Dr. Hynes did his undergraduate work in Biochemistry at Trinity College, Cambridge, UK, and his Phin Biology at on the segregation of maternal mRNAs in early sea urchin embryos.  He then returned to the as a postdoctoral fellow at Imperial Cancer Research Fund in London.  By investigating the molecular changes on cell surfaces that distinguish cancer cells from normal cells, he discovered fibronectin, a cell adhesion protein present on normal cells but noticeably absent on cancer cells.
Dr. Hynes returned to in 1975 as an Assistant Professor and one of the founding members of the Cancer Center.  There he continued to work out the biology of fibronectin, showing that fibronectin affects cellular adhesion, migration, morphology and cytoskeleton and that fibronectin and actin fibrils coalign across the cell surface.  These discoveries established the extracellular matrix (ECM), previously viewed largely as a structural entity, as having a vital role in controlling cell adhesion, morphology and migration.  Dr. Hynes also made major contributions to the discovery and first cloning of integrins, a family of receptors that bind fibronectin and other cell adhesion molecules and form transmembrane links to the cytoskeleton.  He and his colleagues also discovered the activation of through integrins, thereby establishing integrins as true signaling receptors.  The Hynes laboratory cloned and analyzed many of the key molecules involved in cell adhesion (e.g., fibronectin, thrombospondin, integrins, talin, plakoglobin) and generated the first knockout mice lacking adhesion molecules (fibronectin, a5 integrin, P-selectin) and subsequently many others (e.g., other integrins and selectins, cadherins and multiple proteins) and exploited them to dissect the roles of cell adhesion in normal development, hemostasis, thrombosis, leukocyte traffic and inflammation, angiogenesis and cancer.  Most recently the Hynes laboratory has focused on metastasis, particularly contributions of platelet-tumor cell interactions and in promoting metastasis and has developed methods for systematic characterization and analysis of changes in vivo. 
Dr. Hynes' work over the past 40 years has played a major role in establishing the molecular basis of cell adhesion and its many diverse and important effects on cells both in vitro and in vivo.  This molecular understanding has formed the basis for development of antibodies and drugs that modulate cell adhesion and are in clinical use against thrombosis, inflammation and autoimmune diseases and under investigation for efficacy against cancers.  Molecular understanding of cell-interactions is also being exploited in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.

Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania
Dr. Kelly obtained his medical degree from the University of Illinois College of Medicine in Chicago in 1982. He was an Intern (1982-1983) and an Assistant Resident in Medicine (1983-1985) at Barnes Hospital in St. Louis.  Thereafter, he did a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship in the Department of Biological Chemistry (1985-1987) followed by Clinical Cardiology Fellowship training (1987-1989) at Washington University School of Medicine.  Dr. Kelly joined the Washington University School of Medicine faculty in 1989 and rapidly moved up the ranks to Professor of Medicine, Molecular Biology & Pharmacology, and Pediatrics (1999). While at Washington University School of Medicine, Dr. Kelly held the Tobias and Hortense Lewin Professorship and served as Chief of the Cardiovascular Division (2006-2008).  He launched the Center for Cardiovascular Research at Washington University in 1996.  In 2008, Dr. Kelly assumed the role of founding Scientific Director for Sanford Burnham Prebys Medical Discovery Institute located in Lake Nona, Florida.  In August 2017, he moved to the University of Pennsylvania where he was named Director of the Penn Cardiovascular Institute.
Dr. Kelly's research interests stem from an early fascination with rare inborn errors in mitochondrial metabolism in children which cause sudden death and heart failure.  As a young researcher at Washington University, Dr. Kelly defined the genetic basis for a common inborn error in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, work that led to the development of practical screening tests for newborns.  Thereafter, he became interested in how similar derangements in cardiac energy metabolism contribute to heart failure and sudden death in common acquired forms of mitochondrial diseases caused by hypertension, ischemic injury, and diabetes.  His work defined the transcriptional regulatory axis involved in the control of cardiac fuel and energy metabolism through pioneering fundamental work on nuclear receptors including the PPARs, estrogen-related receptors (ERRs), and their transcriptional coactivator PGC-1.  The Kelly laboratory has identified molecular "switches" in this regulatory pathway that potentially define distforms of heart failure, an important step towards identifying therapeutic targets for phenotype-specific treatment of heart failure.  More recently, the Kelly laboratory has applied proteomic and metabolomic approaches to investigating the metabolic origins of heart failure.

Gordon Tomaselli, M.D., FAHA, FACC, FHRS
The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine
Dr. Gordon Tomaselli is the chief of the Johns Hopkins Division of Cardiology. He is an expert in the fields of sudden cardiac death and arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms). Specifically, Dr. Tomaselli focuses on ion channels, the movement of molecules in and out of heart cells, which generates the electrical impulses that cause the heart to beat. He holds several patents on methods to improve heart function and prevent arrhythmias, including an implantable device for the delivery of cell-derived biomolecules.
Dr. Tomaselli earned his undergraduate degree in biochemistry and chemistry in 1977 from the State University of New York at Buffalo and his medical degree in 1982 from Albert Einstein College of Medicine. He completed his medical training and residency at the University of California at San Francisco (UCSF) in 1985. He served as a research fellow at the Cardiovascular Research Institute and then a clinical and research fellow at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine before joining the faculty three years later. Sthen, he has received numerous awards and served on a variety of boards and committees. Dr. Tomaselli was president of the Cardiac Electrophysiology Society from 2003 to 2005 and president of the American Heart Association from 2011 to 2012.
The Tomaselli laboratory studies cardiac electrophysiology at multiple levels of integration from molecules and cells to abnormalities of heart rhythm in patients.
At a molecular level, they seek to    understand how ion channel proteins perform their essential tasks, in    particular they are interested in a key paradox how these channels permit    the flow of millions of ions a second, yet do this with exquisite    selectivity (sodium channels allow sodium ions but not similarly sized and    charged potassium ions).
Altered regulation of sodium,    calcium and potassium channels by important cellular signaling systems    which are involved in not only in how the heart conducts electricity but    also the force with which it contracts and underlie important heritable    and acquired diseases of the heart and skeletal muscle
Modeling diseases of ion channels    (channelopathies) by using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and    differentiating them in heart and skeletal muscle cells. These cells are    used to create cardiospheres that are used to "print" three dimensional    tissues with a 3Bioprinter and reseed decellularized tissue matrices    with the differentiated stem cells. This will allow us to 3human tissue    models of disease without having to surgically remove biopsies of heart or    muscle.  
At the ultimate level of    integration they have an ongoing study of the role of implanted    defibrillators (ICDs) in patients with diseased, remodeled hearts. The    study is referred to as PROSe-(PRospective Observational Study of the    in the prevention of sudden death). PROSe-has enrolled nearly 1200    patients all have undergone detailed clinical and electrocardiographic    studies as well as having blood collected for performing genetic and    proteomic analyses. Over 25% of this cohort has undergone detailed cardiac    imaging (and CT) and spectroscopy to identify imaging based markers of    risk of sudden death. The overarching goal is to better understand the    mechanisms of sudden arrhythmic death and to develop better predictors of    risk of this devastating outcome.

Chair, Department of Neurobiology
Harvard Medical School
Michael Greenberg is the Chair of the Department of Neurobiology and  Nathan Marsh Pusey Professor at Harvard Medical School. He received his Ph. from the Rockefeller University in 1982 and carried out his postdoctoral  research at New York University Medical Center. After joining the faculty at  Harvard Medical School in 1986, Dr. Greenberg served first as the founding Director  of the Kirby Neurobiology Center at Boston Children's Hospital and s 2008 as Chair of the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School.
Dr. Greenberg's research seeks to understand how neuronal activity  controls gene transcription to effect critical steps in synapse and neural  circuit development. In addition to providing insight into the process of brain  development, this research has contributed to the understanding of neurological  diseases in which these processes have gone awry.  This work began in 1984 with the discovery  that growth factors induce the rapid and transient expression of a family of  genes, Immediate Early Genes (IEGs) such as c-fos, whose functions are crucial for  neuronal differentiation, cell survival, and adaptive responses.  Dr. Greenberg's recent studies have used genomics  to identify neuronal transcripts and cis-regulatory elements that respond to  changes in synaptic activity, uncovering an activity-responsive transcriptional  program that regulates the complexity of the dendritic arbor, the development  of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, the composition of protein complexes at  the pre- and post-synaptic sites, and the production of neuropeptides that  control neural circuit development. These activity-regulated processes are  critical for normal human brain development and function, and defects in the  activity-dependent gene program contribute to disorders of human cognition such  as Rett Syndrome (RTT) and Angelman Syndrome (AS), two neurological disorders  associated with syndromic autism. Dr. Greenberg is particularly interested in  those activity-dependent processes that have evolved humans and contribute to  human variation and high cognitive function.

Dr. Carla Shatz is Sapp Family Provostial Professor of Biology and Neurobiology and the David Starr Jordan Director of Bio-X, Stanford University's pioneering interdisciplinary biosciences program that brings together faculty from across the entire university- Clinicians, Biologists, Engineers, Physicists, Computer Scientists- to unlock the secrets of the human body. She received her in Chemistry from Radcliffe College in 1969, an M.Phil. in Physiology in 1971 from University College London as a Marshall Scholar, and a Ph.in Neurobiology from Harvard Medical School in 1976. Dr. Shatz is a neuroscientist who has devoted her research career to understanding the dynamic interplay between genes and environment that shapes brain circuits - the very essence of our being. Her lab found that the spontaneous activity of neurons in utero is critical for forming and then tuning up precise neural connections in the central nervous system: the developing brain runs test patterns to validate and tune neural circuitry. Her ongoing dissection of molecular mechanisms of circuit tuning has identified novel genes, including the unexpected finding that Class proteins (Human HLA), famous for their roles in immune recognition, are present in neurons and regulate synaptic plasticity and pruning during developmental critical periods. Her research on cellular and molecular mechanisms of how the early developing brain is transformed into adult circuitry has relevance not only for disorders such as autism and schizophrenia, but also for understanding the synapse loss in Alzheimer's disease and how nervous and immune systems interact. Dr. Shatz is past president of the 40,000 member Society for Neuroscience. Prior to Stanford, she was Chairwoman of the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School. She has received many awards and honors including election to the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, the Institute of Medicine.

Stephen Waxman, MD, PhD
Yale School of Medicine
Stephen Waxman is the Bridget Flaherty Professor of Neurology, Neurobiology, and Pharmacology at Yale University, and served as Chairman of Neurology at Yale from 1986 until 2009.   He founded and is Director of the Neuroscience & Regeneration Research Center at Yale.   Prior to moving to Yale, he worked at Harvard, MIT, and Stanford.  He is also Visiting Professor at University College London.   
Dr. Waxman received his from Harvard, and his and Phdegrees from Albert Einstein College of Medicine.  His research uses tools from the "molecular revolution" to find new therapies that will promote recovery of function after injury to the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. 
Dr. Waxman's research has defined the ion channel architecture of nerve fibers, and demonstrated its importance for axonal conduction (Science, 1985).  He demonstrated increased expression of sodium channels in demyelinated axons (Science, 1982), identified the channel isoforms responsible for this remarkable neuronal plasticity which supports remission in multiple sclerosis (PNAS, 2004), and delineated the roles of sodium channels in axonal degeneration (PNAS, 1993).  He has made pivotal discoveries that explain pain after nerve injury.  In translational leaps from laboratory to humans, he carried out molecule-to-man studies combining molecular genetics, molecular biology, and biophysics to demonstrate the contribution of ion channels to human pain (Trends in Molec.Med, 2005; PNAS, 2006).  He led an international coalition that identified sodium channel mutations as causes of peripheral neuropathy (PNAS, 2012) and has used atomic-level  modeling to advance pharmacogenomics (Nature Comm., 2012).  An entirely new class of medications for neuropathic pain, based largely on his work, are in Phase clinical trials.
Dr. Waxman has published more than 600 scientific papers.  He has as edited nine books, and is the author of Spinal Cord Compression and of Clinical Neuroanatomy (translated into eight languages).  He has served on the editorial boards of many journals including  Brain,  Annals of Neurology,  Trends in Neurosciences,  Nature Reviews Neurology, The Journal of Physiology, and Trends in Molecular Medicine, and is Editor-in-Chief of Neuroscience Letters.  He has trained more than 150 academic neurologists and neuroscientists who lead research teams around the world.

The process that brings a new drug from the research laboratory to the marketplace is a long and careful one. Long,     because it takes years to complete all the laboratory, animal and human tests; careful, because all those involved     in bringing it to market must ensure patient safety and follow strict government regulations in evaluating the     drug's safety and efficacy.
One of the most important steps in the development process is the clinical trial, which is a study with people who volunteer to receive the drug and be observed for its effects. It is through these trials that     investigational drugs are tested to determine whether they can benefit human beings. But before this can happen,     people must volunteer and participate - a choice that may benefit not only the individual but many, many others as     well.
Whether or not you qualify for a clinical trial depends on a number of factors, including your medical condition.     Your physician will discuss these factors with you and provide comprehensive information on the investigational drug     and the trial itself.
Still, you may have questions. Participation in a clinical trial can be a great undertaking, and there are no     guarantees that the investigational drug will work. This page, however, will help you understand some of the     potential benefits and risks of participation, and give you some idea of what to expect if you decide to     participate.
clinical trial is carefully supervised research that is done in humans prior to the availability of an                 investigational drug to the general public.
The term clinical refers to research performed in a hospital or clinic setting in which a physician and                 other healthcare professionals observe a participant. trial is a study, whereby the drug is analyzed for its                 effects on a                 group of participants.
However, before a drug enters the clinical trial phase, it is extensively tested through basic or                 preclinical                 research in the laboratory, both in lab experiments and in animals. The type of experiments depends on                 the disease                 being studied, and if animals also can have the same disease. This type of research is extremely                 important in                 gathering information on the drug's possible benefits and risks before it is tested in humans.
It is important to understand that both basic research and research done through clinical trials are                 carefully                 supervised, monitored and documented. Investigational drugs must demonstrate their safety and efficacy                 to government                 regulators (such as the Food and Drug Administration in the United States) before they are approved.                 Clinical trial                 volunteers play a very big role in this process.
The reasons why people become involved in clinical trials are as varied as the individuals themselves.
Some people have an illness that currently has no treatment. clinical trial may offer the opportunity                 to try an                 investigational medication, which may help.
Others may become involved because their current medication has too many side effects and they want to                 see if they                 can tolerate the investigational drug being tested.
And others volunteer because they want to help find answers to scientific or medical questions that will                 help others                 benefit in the future.
Only you can decide whether or not to participate in a clinical trial. That's why you should take plenty                 of time to                 think about the trial and ask all the questions you want. You may even consider asking a close friend or                 family                 member to help you in your decision—they may have questions or concerns that you may not have                 considered.
Above all, remember that there are risks associated with clinical trials. And yes, it's a tough decision.                 Have all                 the facts before you make up your mind.
"decided to enter a clinical trial because hoped that the research would be of help to future                 patients."
Investigational drugs are tested in clinical trials because not everything is yet known about them. So                 there may be                 risks to receiving the drug, which will not be uncovered until after a clinical trial begins. Your                 physician will                 discuss these potential risks with you. You should carefully weigh them against the possible benefits,                 and ask as                 many questions as you need to. Keep the following in mind when evaluating risks:
Sometimes the risks, or side effects, may seem no worse than those of your current treatment                     options. Other                     times, the side effects may seem greater.
You may react differently from another individual when given the same drug. Preclinical testing in                     the                     laboratory can often give scientists and physicians an idea of what individuals may experience in                     the clinical                     setting. But every person is different. Your physician will ask you a lot of questions ahead of time                     to learn as                     much as possible about your medical history in order to reduce the potential risks.
In addition, the risks associated with clinical trials can vary depending upon the disease being                     treated. These                     risks are carefully weighed and balanced by your physician, the study physician, the national                     regulatory agency                     (such as the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] in the US), and an Institutional Review Board                     (IRB)/Independent                     Ethics Committee (IEC). An IRB/is an independent body that includes medical, scientific and                     non-medical                     representatives. The IRB/reviews and approves a clinical study for safety issues and protects the                     rights and                     well-being of study participants.
If something shows up that is a risk to participants in the clinical trial, the participants will be                     notified by                     the investigator and, under some circumstances, the trial may be stopped or placed on hold until                     more                     information is known.
There are a number of potential benefits from participating in a clinical trial. In general, they                 include:
Becoming involved in the testing of an investigational drug that would not otherwise be available.
The possibility of free study medication and study-related medical care during the clinical trial.
Contributing to medical science, which may help other patients now and in the future.
"was always willing to try anything that was available to potentially help in finding new treatment                 options for                 the disease."
—Matt, Clinical Trial Volunteer
Clinical trials can occur in a variety of places. Some are performed in a hospital and others right in                 the doctor's                 office. Still others are done in special research centers.
If you decide to participate in a clinical trial, you will receive information regarding the study                 location.
You should not be asked to pay to be in a clinical trial. In most cases, study medication is provided                 free of charge.
In addition, the costs of many tests and procedures associated with the trial will not be charged to you.                 And in most                 instances, the cost of routine tests and procedures that are part of your normal healthcare might be                 paid under                 your current insurance plan or covered by your healthcare provider.
If you are considering participation in a clinical trial, discuss the potential financial implications                 with your                 physician or other healthcare professional. They can tell you exactly what will be covered as part of                 the clinical                 trial and what will be considered part of your normal healthcare routine, including that which may be                 your                 responsibility. Remember to ask everything that's on your mind. It's your right.
Not every disease will have a clinical trial currently underway. But this situation is constantly                 changing. Consult                 your physician or patient support group to learn if research is being planned which may be appropriate                 for you.
"found an article on the bulletin board at the hospital...and they were eager to talk to people who                 were                 interested in potentially getting involved with a study."
Your responsibilities will be explained to you by your healthcare team. In general, however, you                 must                 see your study                 physician as scheduled and take the study medication as directed.
You may also be asked to keep a diary of your experience with the study medication; this may help                 give                 your study                 physician information on its safety and effectiveness. You should also contact your study                 physician as                 soon as                 possible if you are hospitalized for any reason.
In addition, it is important to let all of your non-study physicians know that you are                 participating in a                 clinical                 trial. They will need the name and phone number of the study physician in order to let him or                 her know                 about any                 pertinent medical information that may affect your participation in the trial. It is advisable                 to keep                 the study                 physician's name and number with you at all times in case of emergency.
No. Clinical research is regulated by federal/national government and by the medical profession.                 You are                 protected                 from unauthorized research without your consent through a process known as informed consent.
Informed consent means that your physician and/or study nurse will thoroughly explain the                 clinical trial                 to you and                 may provide a package of information on the trial along with an informed consent form. The                 informed                 consent form                 provides information on the length of the study, potential side effects (if known) from the drug                 being                 tested, your                 rights to withdraw from the study, and how the study is considered completed.
The consent form will also explain how the study protocol is designed, whether or not a placebo                 is to be                 used, and                 what kind of tests will be required. If you don't understand any of the terms of an informed                 consent                 form, it is                 important that you ask your physician or nurse.
Once you are satisfied that you have a full understanding of the nature and scope of the trial                 and decide                 to proceed,                 and if you qualify to participate, you may decide to sign the informed consent form. However,                 remember                 that you                 always have the right to say no. If you are uncomfortable with what you are being asked to do in                 the                 study, or if                 you don't fully understand it, or if you simply no longer want to participate, do not feel like                 you have                 to                 participate.About

Lori Johnston, Amgen’s of Human Resources, talks about the changing nature of the workforce and what is doing to stay ahead of the curve.   
Are there any broad trends influencing Amgen’s approach to its workforce? 
The way people interact with their employers is changing. The challenge is to find a way to provide offerings that may be more appealing from one person to the next, whether it’s time off, a commitment to the community, or the ability to save for the future. In a few short years, over 50 percent of the workforce will likely be Millennials, and Generation is not far behind. As we’ve seen through history, each generation grows up experiencing some very different life-shaping events such as 9/11 or the Great Financial Crisis. So they value different things – e.g. a solid career, opportunity for progression, skills building, particular benefits. We need to approach our staff with some flexibility to align with what is meaningful to them at various stages in their life and we are experimenting with how we can do that.
What career advice can you offer?
Find out where your true passion lies. Not specifically, but generally. I’m passionate about the intersection of business and people. love it. Give your manager that direction. It’s almost like a You don’t really get anywhere if you don’t stick an address in. Tell you manager what really drives and motivates you. Then you need to perform. Push yourself. Gather feedback and make course corrections. Then “rinse and repeat.” You also have to “show up.” You either add energy to a team or take it away. Add it. Be a problem solver, not just a problem identifier. Raise your hand for tough assignments. Your career is about what you put into it. Those who get the most out of it know themselves really well. They know their passion and what gives them energy. They practice their skill, make refinements and work every day to be solving the big issues at hand.
What do you want to accomplish while you are here at Amgen?
personally want to help through this next phase of the industry. don’t know when, but we are probably going to see a new business model emerge in our space. want to be a part of shaping how we add value to patients as things evolve. On a more individual level, get no greater thrill than when someone that have coached or mentored goes on to do something great. love seeing people achieve great things and want to be a part of enabling that.
Research suggests that social responsibility is becoming an increasingly important factor for Millennials in choosing a company. How does stack up?
I’m a board member of the 
, which is the philanthropic arm of Amgen, and one of the things we’ve done recently is to begin a series of conversations about how we engage our broad base of employees to help us achieve what we want to achieve around advancing (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) education, particularly in communities that don’t have a great deal of resources. We have a number of programs focused on science education. 
 is one good example. We’re teaming up with Harvard University to develop a free virtual lab experience for students to gain these much-needed skills regardless of geography or income level. 
What makes different from other companies?
One unique thing about is that we have what’s called the Social Architecture, which helps define our culture. It consists of our Mission to serve patients, our Aspiration to be the world’s best human therapeutics company, the Strategy that results from that, our Values, and the Attributes we look for in our leaders. Many companies have not gone as far as we have to build that out. Some have built it out on paper, but you don’t feel it inside. At you’ll hear the people who work here say things like, “Wow, you guys really do live this stuff.” That makes a huge difference.
