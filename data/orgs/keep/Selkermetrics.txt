SelkerMetrics, helps clients and regulators understand water and sediment movement in the environment. We use fiber optic distributed temperature sensing (DTS) and other technologies to locate and characterize seeps emerging into water bodies from sediment and through barriers. We also deploy  sensors in wells to understand underground and within-well fluid movements.
technology can now also track sediment deposition and scouring over large areas, for extended durations, and with high precision.specializes in planning, analysis, and design of environmental monitoring projects. Our team applies cutting-edge measurement and analysis solutions to provide clear and quantitative environmental information.
has created proprietary hardware and software that enables efficient and accurate characterization of water movement in a variety of environments.  Our equipment has been proven and refined in a wide variety of settings including rivers, marine coastal areas, and groundwater.
Applications have included numerous Superfund investigations and results have been published in peer-reviewed journals and submitted to state and national regulators.
All of our team spends time in the field, analyzing data, and most importantly, listening to our clients. Our process excels at translating data into easily understood, customer specific metrics to help you address your unique environmental challenges.
