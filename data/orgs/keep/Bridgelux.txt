At Bridgelux, we help companies, industries and people experience the power and possibility of light. Since 2002, we’ve designed solid-state lighting solutions that are high performance, energy efficient, cost effective and easy to integrate. 
Lighting isn’t just science. It is emotion. 
Our patented light source technology produces clean, white LEDs used as the core of commercial and industrial lighting. It’s a rapidly growing market, and everything we do is focused on understanding light’s impact on human behavior, and delivering products that create better environments and experiences. That’s why products are backed by research, world-class engineering, and human intuition.
The industry is changing. We keep you ahead.

We bring large semiconductor R&to important collaborations on extending technology. We are a member of global industry groups like 
, as we participate in new solutions to current problems, and a better future for solid-state lighting.
Where are solutions? 
Everywhere. Our arry and chip product platforms are the ambience in high-end retail, hospitality spaces and restaurants. It’s the efficiency of high bay lights for warehouses and factories. Outdoors, we add safety and illumination to building exteriors, parking lots, roadways and landscapes.
When our Décor Series™ Class Chip on Board (COB) arrays spotlight encourages a shopper to linger longer and buy more, or the Series™ drastically reduces relamping expenses along a busy street, that’s the measure of success. We make a difference in the way you light the world.

In Face of Bitter Patent Competition: Quick Q&with Tim Lester, CEO, LEDinside
August 27, 2017
Ask Apps: How do replace an obsolete part?
Ask Apps: Can COBs be wired in series or parallel?
The Collegiate Church of Saints Peter and Stephen is a religious building located in Bellinzona, Switzerland. The building is the seat of the Ticinese city parish, and is home to numerous works of art dating back to the 15th century.
The church has symbolic value as a place of worship, and architectural value as a building that encompasses and preserves valuable works of art. The city of Bellinzona required development of a lighting system that is able to adapt and respond to the various needs of this structure.
Novuswas asked to substitute existing sodium and mercury luminaires to street lights on 28th October Street and Megalou Alexandrou Square in Aspropirgos, Greece. The goal was to turn this poorly illuminated street and square into bright and safe environments for both drivers and pedestrians.
9 Arkwright Road has recently undergone a comprehensive ‘bare bones’ refit to provide a series of premium apartment residences in the heart of London’s prestigious Hampstead area.  Architects Oakley Hough commissioned Ecoled to supply the bespoke lighting using arrays, which were installed throughout the property.
