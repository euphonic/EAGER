In 1968, at the very outset of the global semiconductor industry, entrepreneur Arthur del Prado established in the Netherlands. Mr Del Prado served as President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Management Board of International until his retirement, in 2008. Acclaimed as the "father of the European semiconductor equipment industry”, his contrib​utions to the industry are legendary. To read more about his career click here ​. Guided by his unique pioneering vision of how the industry would develop, began to sell its own wafer processing equipment for semiconductor manufacturers. Our long journey as industry pioneers was underway.
Our dual-reactor family of vertical furnaces, the Advance Series, is the most productive vertical furnace in the industry.
Wafer processing was only the start. In 1975, we established Pacific Technologies (ASMPT) in Hong Kong, adding Back-end assembly & packaging capabilities to wafer processing. We were now involved in the entire chip making process – from unprocessed silicon wafers right through to packaged chips ready to be placed on circuit boards.
is the world's largest supplier of integrated assembly and packaging solutions.
Right from the start, we realized that our leading edge thinking needed support from the best minds available. forged early ties with leading Dutch universities and the research department of electronics multinational Philips. culture of cooperation with advanced learning centers was established.
Although was founded in the Netherlands, we always had broader vision. From day one, we saw ourselves as a truly global company. After expanding from Europe into Asia in 1975, we founded in 1976 and followed that  with Japan in 1982.
We’re active in R&D, manufacturing and sales in 15 different countries across the world.
We were behind many of the breakthroughs that are today considered essential to the semiconductor industry: take processes such as deposition, lithography and ion implantation. Today, our new pioneering deposition technologies are continuing to deliver excellence.
In wafer processing we focus on our core strength – deposition.
In 1999, we acquired Microchemistry in Helsinki, Finland. Up until that time, for over 30 years, all our growth had been organic. Acquiring this pioneer in Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) enabled us to begin a new era of deposition innovations. Depositing materials one atomic layer at a time with great precision to form very uniform films on a range of topologies. is now making scaling possible, using a whole new range of materials and 3chips.
We continue to maintain R&facilities at the University of Helsinki, the world's largest academic research center for ALD.
Front-end established a new manufacturing base in Singapore in 2004, right next to the existing facilities of Back-end, so that we could achieve the highest standards in the most efficient ways possible. Making a name you can trust to deliver.
Singapore has expanded to become the global hub for our financial services, Information and Communications Technology (ICT)​ and sales.
Innovation gives us an opportunity to create new Intellectual Property (IP) and to own the breakthroughs we make. By licensing our technologies, we not only create revenue, we also accelerate the acceptance of those technologies across the world.
In 2006, we were named one of the top ten global companies for the value of our portfolio in the first Instituate of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Spectrum study.
We maintain our innovation leadership through our technology roadmap that we co-create with our customers. The roadmap matches our research to their upcoming needs and provides a strategy for long-term cooperation. We then invest heavily in promising technologies that have the ability to make a real difference for our customers.
In 2007, at the 45nm node, our Pulsar tool became the first system used in high-volume manufacturing of devices using a new hafnium-based high-k dielectric material.
“It’s easier to predict the future than change the past,” said Einstein. We cannot know what the future will bring, but we can make strong predictions. The past 45 years have taught us that the demand for faster, more powerful devices will continue – bringing new challenges and new opportunities. We believe that our ability to turn innovation into manufacturing efficiency will be key to the success of the semiconductor industry as a whole.
In our labs, we’re currently working on device geometries of 10nm and below.​​​​​​​Contact

First name is a required field.
Saint Vincent and The Grenadines
​He excelled in innovation. Combined with strategic vision and a steadfast focus on the long-term, it proved the touchstone of his success and laid the foundation for the growth of and the semiconductor equipment manufacturing sector.
From its onset, more than five decades ago, to the present day, his imprint and influence on the industry is clear and unmistakable.
In the 1950s, he was first to see a significant role for the Netherlands in the then fledgling sector.
He founded in 1964, and was its Chief Executive Officer until 2008. In 1975, he established Pacific Technology, and was Chairman until May 9, 2016. His entrepreneurship and drive led to the creation, in 1984, of ASML, a joint venture between Philips and ASM, and later and Mapper. He participated in European research projects such as and MEDEA.
Del Prado was born in Batavia in 1931. In World War he was interned, without his family, in a Japanese prison camp. After liberation, he was reunited with his parents and sister and the family moved to the Netherlands, where he studied Chemistry in Enschede and Economics in Amsterdam, after which he spent some time at Harvard Business School in Boston.
In 1954 he moved to the and there - in what is now known as Silicon Valley - was first struck by the entrepreneurship and innovation of the burgeoning semiconductor industry.
Returning to the Netherlands in 1958, he developed the Dutch and Western European market, mainly for American suppliers of semiconductor technologies - initially in Naarden and, from 1961, in Bilthoven. In 1964, he started Advanced Semiconductor Materials (ASM), registering it as a private company (BV) in 1968.
Del Prado and were the point of entry to the European market for American suppliers of semiconductor technologies. As a result, he had, effectively, created the European semiconductor equipment industry.
His charisma, energy and optimism won him the confidence and support of many. Del Prado thought only in opportunities and rarely saw obstacles. He had the ability to identify and develop promising technologies at an early stage. And his vision extended far beyond the Netherlands.
But, while he was a true cosmopolitan, he never lost touch with his Dutch roots, remaining convinced of the contribution the Netherlands could make to semiconductor technology.
He was daring, often referring to himself as a katjong - a Dutch-Indonesian term for a naughty boy. And it was this strategic skill that helped him build a key position in the industry.
In 1971, launched production of the first vapor deposition furnaces. The company grew from sales to innovation, developing and manufacturing its own technologies. In 1974, Del Prado acquired a controlling stake in Fico Toolings, a manufacturer of materials for use in the semiconductor packaging industry. Renaming it Fico, it opened the way to new and bigger markets beyond Western Europe.
The products of Fico were used for the packaging and assembly of semiconductor devices. From the 1960s, this part of the industry was commonly located in Southeast Asia. Seeing the trend, in 1975 Del Prado opened Asia in Hong Kong. Initially the office sold Fico products, but, over time, it developed its own production capacities. In 1988 these activities would be publicly-listed as Pacific Technology. That company would grow to become the world's largest supplier of semiconductor assembly and packaging technologies.
In 1976 Del Prado established America, its first operation in Phoenix, Arizona, nearby Motorola Semiconductors, then the largest semiconductor manufacturer. But more significantly, was the platform by which Del Prado brought the Plasma Enhanced process to the market, marking the breakthrough of as an original equipment supplier.
Such consistent rapid growth could only be sustained with new investment. In 1981, International became the first Dutch company to have a primary listing on NASDAQ, the then-young technology stock exchange in New York. year later, it would be the first Dutch company to establish a wholly-owned subsidiary in Japan.
The listing put and Del Prado on the international map. In 1983 he was named Director of the Year by the Dutch Association of Board members and Supervisory Board members (NCD). year later launched a joint venture with Philips to develop and market Philips’ lithography technology. Del Prado had spent years urging Philips’ management to team up before finally convincing them. The company was called Lithography - now known as ASML.
By the mid-eighties, ASM's product portfolio included nearly all major production technologies: deposition furnaces, lithography, ion implantation, die and wire bonders, and various packaging technologies. The company was well on its way to being a one-stop-shop for the industry.
Del Prado's strategic focus on a wide range of technologies and markets would ensure it continued to prosper and was not dependent on any individual element.
While he remained constantly and closely informed of developments, Del Prado believed in giving people the freedom to capture opportunities. He believed local managers knew more about local needs than he did, and he placed tremendous trust in his technicians. It was this philosophy that propelled through rapid growth in the mid-80s, further boosted by a booming market for semiconductor technologies.
In 1996, International was publicly-listed on the in Amsterdam. Under Del Prado's leadership, it acquired Finnish company Microchemistry (1999) and Korean group Genitech (2004), cementing its position as market leader in atomic layer deposition (ALD).
In 2001, Del Prado participated in the first-round investment for Mapper Lithography, a company focused on the development of an innovative maskless lithography machine. It would prove one of many occasions over the years when Del Prado's decision to invest early would give others the confidence to follow. The project was the ideal showcase for his long-term vision, drive and entrepreneurship. Del Prado remained closely involved until his death, as an important investor and as a member of its Supervisory Board. He believed strongly in the importance of this technology for the semiconductor industry. Mapper currently is in an important phase of its development, with the goal to become a world player in maskless lithography.
In 2008, Del Prado was awarded the prestigious "Legend of the Industry" award at Semicon West, the first ever non-American to receive the prize, which is presented annually to an individual who has made extraordinary contributions to the semiconductor industry over an extended period of time.
That same year, Del Prado retired as CEO, and shareholders approved the appointment of his eldest son, Chuck, as his successor. He remained Chairman of until his retirement in May 2016.
Arthur del Prado died peacefully at his home on September 9, 2016. He is rightly recognized as the father of the European semiconductor equipment industry. Indeed, it is impossible to imagine today's industry without him.​​Contact

But no one company can solve all the challenges on the semiconductor industry’s technology roadmap on its own. That’s why we have always developed strong partnerships with our customers and research institutes and academia. The best ideas can come from anywhere and it is only by having open partnerships with the top semiconductor manufacturers and leading research institutes that great minds have the opportunity to think and act together.
The short answer is by research. When we talk about research it’s tempting to picture a single scientist making a breakthrough, but simply relying on individual brilliance is never enough. The advanced nature of our research and the complexity of the science involved means that only  teams can make the swift progress that our customers need. We build innovation into the whole fabric of our organization at every level. Innovation isn’t just something we do; it’s something we are.
We maintain a  comprehensive technology roadmap that takes the expected needs of our customers over the next five to seven years into account and use that to  matches that to our research activities  to these needs. Our approach delivers results. Bringing processes like high-k and metal gate, low-k, strained Si, and many others  from R&to manufacturing at advanced customer sites.
We don’t believe in innovation for innovation’s sake. All our efforts are focused on delivering precise solutions that can solve critical problems our  our customers face in a timely manner. This means that our research and product development functions are very closely integrated, despite being decentralized geographically.
We conduct research into basic materials and processes followed by process integration testing and then product development. This is how we sum it up:
The solutions are integrated in test devices;
Working solutions are productized for volume manufacturing.
As a global company, we benefit from having the best of both worlds. We have the advantage of R&taking place not at one central site but on different continents around the world. So we enjoy a rich variety of different approaches to solving the key issues on our customer’s  roadmaps. But we also have the ability to bring together the best minds from around the globe to focus on solving a specific issue.
To enhance our research efforts, we partner with the best research organizations in the world. To help our own R&with early stage screening and discovery, we also cooperate with advanced universities and research institutes.
To tap into the best minds available, we also work with development consortia such as the Interuniversity MicroElectronics Center (IMEC) in Leuven, Belgium and the College of Nanoscale Science and Engineering (CNSE), part of the State University of New York, in New York state, for next generation wafer sizes (450mm).
In addition to our links with research institutes, we also maintain very close ties with our customers. We cooperate closely in joint research and development projects. This begins with sharing our technology roadmap and continues as we bring new technologies and processes into volume manufacturing at our customers’ sites. Along the way, we integrate our R&teams with our customers’ R&teams to ensure a smooth transition from research into manufacturing. The process can involve close cooperation over several years for a specific technology.
This approach ensures that our process equipment performs exactly as our customers require it to, in order to meet their precise manufacturing needs.
We also participate in publicly funded programs, mainly in Europe. For example in projects awarded under the Information Society Technologies (IST) seventh framework partnership, European Nanoelectronics Initiative Advisory Council (ENIAC) or the Eureka initiative by (Cluster for Application and Technology Research in Europe on Nano-Electronics). Their aim is usually to develop production technology for semiconductor devices with line widths of 10 nanometers (nm) and smaller. They are also aimed at developing “More than Moore” (MtM) technologies. These include new ways of using core technologies from the semiconductor industry for other chips such as LED’s, power devices, and Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).
We have had a strategic R&partnership with (Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre) since 1990. has a worldwide reputation as a leading research institute in microelectronics. Its core technology partners include almost all of the top semiconductor manufacturers in the world. In addition, IMEC’s research areas cover many parts of the industry’s roadmap.
In December 2003, we began a partnership with the University of Helsinki that aims at the further development of processes and chemistries.​Contact

These documents define the responsibilities of our directors, specify the kind of business undertakes, and detail the means by which our shareholders exert control over our Management Board.​
Privacy statementFor more than 50 years, we​'ve grown by meeting custome​​r demand for more sophisticated wafer processing. From the very start of the semiconductor industry to the present day, we've been technology leaders who have pioneered innovation and brought new processes into mainstream manufacturing.
What benefits does bring? Using allows semiconductor manufacturers to form thin films atom by atom. Creating nanoscale structures and devices with unique properties to meet the challenges posed at very small dimensions.
To put it in perspective, a 22 nanometer (nm) transistor is roughly 3000 times thinner than a single hair. And a single strand of human is 2.5 atoms wide. creates films as thin as a single atom thick.
Building devices, atom by atom, gives us very precise control over the process. It means we can deliver deposition materials at a uniform thickness over all types of topographies. Such precision also enables the use of materials that could not be considered before.
Using ALD, we are now able to deposit new materials several atoms thick on wafers at low temperatures producing ultra-thin films of exceptional quality and uniformity. In Plasma Enhanced (PEALD), plasma is used to further enhance the process.
Using technology, we have been able to scale devices to 45nm and below while reducing the power consumption of transistors. All of which helps to keep the industry on Moore's Law.
is now our basic platform for the development of a wide range of new materials. Our research centers in Finland, the US, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, and Belgium are working on We're also conducting joint research projects with Europe's largest independent research institute IMEC.

and are now both mainstream technologies used in volume manufacturing in the semiconductor industry. ASM's technology is now being used to build a wide range of applications such as leading edge products like high performance computers as well as wireless handheld smart devices. The results of are everywhere in the world around us.
Plasma Enhanced (PEALD) is another in the long line of innovations. It widens the spectrum of materials that can be deposited. Its capability to deposit materials at temperatures as low as room temperature makes it possible to carry out processes on temperature sensitive substrates like photoresist.
This technology is currently in use for Direct Spacer Defined Double Patterning (DSDDP). technique that can reduce device dimensions at 32nm and below, postponing the need for new lithography technologies. This is just one example of how continues to open up new possibilities for further process breakthroughs.
The key to our success lies in our commitment to Research and Development (R&D). We maintain the widest and most diverse development organization in the industry. We're active at all stages in its life cycle, from developing the basic chemistry to implementing at our customer's production sites.
Our research centers in Finland, the US, Japan, Korea, the Netherlands, and Belgium are all working on We also have joint research projects with Europe's largest independent research institute, IMEC, in Belgium. is a truly global company. Diversity means that we get the benefit of wider viewpoints while being able to bring together the best minds in the world to work create new breakthroughs.
We will continue to expand the scope and depth of our research and development capabilities through strategic alliances with independent research institutes, universities, customers and suppliers. We will also keep expanding our patent portfolio where necessary and beneficial.
This is just the beginning. Fundame​ntally, has been around for 30 years but as a technology in semiconductor manufacturing it is still relatively new. We expect it to be one of the principal drivers of growth in microelectronics over the coming decade.
