The passion of the leadership team and the board is truly palpable.
My learning curve since joined has been tremendous. have gained exposure to all facets of the company and as a result learn something new each and every day. It’s been a great challenge and I’ve felt supported and mentored at each step along the way. 
I’ve been in the pharmaceutical industry for most of my career, however this is my first role at a development stage company. It’s exciting to be on the other side of the fence. The passion of the leadership team and the board is truly palpable. That commitment and energy is infectious.

Adam Woodrow, Commercial
There’s an opportunity to be highly involved, to understand the big picture and influence the direction the company takes.
John McPartland, Director - Supply Chain
enjoy being part of a company that’s just starting up, coming in on the  ground floor. There’s an opportunity to be highly involved, to understand  the big picture and influence the direction the company takes.
These characteristics are true of many organizations at this stage, but  is exceptionally good at putting good people in the right  positions. That’s not always done. In my 25 years of experience, I’ve  found that highly accomplished people don’t always play well together. At  Paratek, we’re good at supporting each other and working together to build this rapidly expanding organization.
The other aspect of that is remarkable is the tremendous energy and effort going on now to make the company successful in the future. Since early in development, we have been laying the groundwork and investing in the infrastructure to become a commercial organization. I’m excited to be a part of the vision and to have a hand in bringing it to life.

David Xiao, Marketing Director, Commercial
Antibiotic resistance is a global crisis. Drug resistant bacteria are spreading in both the hospitals and communities.

has a remarkable culture. My colleagues are passionate, respectful, capable, and collaborative. look forward to coming to work everyday, marching toward the end goal, and savoring the successes and experiences along the way.
look forward to coming to work every day because of my coworkers. The mutual respect in our work environment creates a strong foundation for collaboration, is extremely gratifying.
Joanne Tatem, Director - Project Management
Being in a small company provides excellent learning opportunities. enjoy the challenge of working in multiple workstreams and by working so closely with different functional areas; it allows me to expand my knowledge and gain visibility to day to day activities across the organization.
Stephen Viccica, Senior Manager, Regulatory Affairs
We hear firsthand that there is a huge unmet need within the antibiotic market
Cindy Karcewski, Market Research Manager
am lucky enough to be able to conduct the market research with various specialties and hear firsthand that there is a huge unmet need within the antibiotic market.
feel like I’m making a difference and that I’m an important part of the team.
Kary Callahan, Senior Manager - Accounting
is growing, but it’s still a small company. Leadership depends on everybody and there are no silos here. There’s a lot of interaction, respect  and collaboration across functions. That’s a core part of the culture we’re  trying to create here and everyone at has an opportunity to  shape that.
Working for a company that’s focused on antibiotics makes you think  about what you’re doing in a different way. Everyone has to take an  antibiotic at some point; pneumonia and other infections are pretty  common. Before started here, was working at another biotech  company, but the personal impact wasn’t as strong. The stories of the  patients we’ll be able to help could easily be my story or my family  member’s story. Every day that come to work, realize how important  these medicines are to my life and to the lives of everyone around me.
When come to work each day, feel like I’m making a difference and  that I’m an important part of the team. Everyone made me feel that way  from the minute started; it’s what made me want to join and  what makes me want to stay.
By continuing, you understand that you are exiting Pharmaceutical’s website and are being directed to a website, being maintained by a third party, whom has contracted with to assist in the recruitment of Hospital Sales Representatives.
