We set third quarter records for sales, diluted earnings per share and Adjusted diluted earnings per share, and returned
to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. All of our operating segments reported sales growth compared to the third quarter of 2017 and, excluding both acquisitions net of divestitures and foreign exchange movements, sales for all segments outgrew global light vehicle production. However, our sales were slightly lower than we had anticipated, mainly due to lower than expected light vehicle production. Adjusted was below the comparable quarter in 2017 and was less than what we expected.  After taking into account the impact of lower than anticipated volumes, our Power & Vision, Seating Systems and Complete Vehicles segments performed substantially in line with our expectations.

an increase in the proportion of sales generated in our Complete Vehicles segment relative to total sales, which have a significantly lower margin than our consolidated average;
lower margins in the third quarter of 2018 in our Seating Systems segment, mainly associated with pre-operating costs incurred at new facilities and favourable customer pricing resolutions in the third quarter of 2017; and
