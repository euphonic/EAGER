One Least Significant Bit Could Have the Most Significant Impact
Connecting to the World, With and Without Wires
Easy-to-Use Embedded Intelligence Supported by World-Class Development Tools and Software
Looking for a part or a development tool? We offer a variety of ways to find the solution you need.
Want to see an easy way to get there? From key functions to full applications, let us show you the way.
No system can perform without reliable power supplies. Our Digitally Enhanced Power Analog (DEPA) family of products combine the performance of an analog Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) controller with the configurability of an 8-bit PIC® Microcontroller (MCU).
Flawless Performance in Harsh Environments
Automotive and industrial applications require microcontrollers (MCUs) that can provide secure communication, real-time data delivery and robust operation in extreme temperatures and noisy environments. Our MCUs help preserve your software investments with their ability to work with a variety of protocols, while improving system reliability, safety and security.
Want less hassle adding authentication and encryption capabilities to your design? The CEC1702 IoDevelopment Kit decreases development time for both the Device Identifier Composition Engine (DICE) and the Azure IoHub Device Provisioning Service (DPS).
