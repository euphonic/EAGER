Inc. is a process development and licensing company, specializing in catalyst and process technology for the upgrading of crude oil and oil distillates.
				Auterra's family of patented process technologies provide cost-effective solutions for challenging times.  Embracing elegant chemistry with an emphasis on low capital and operating costs, has developed unique solutions for the worlds increasingly heavy and sour feedstocks.  Solutions have been developed for lighter hydrocarbon challenges as well.  
								More and more crudes are being discounted by high sulfur levels, high viscosity, high nitrogen levels and high acidity.  FlexUP™ can improve the overall quality of your crude oil cost effectively and improve your operating margins.  
was founded in 2003 as Applied NanoWorks, with a focus on developing high value specialty inorganic compounds.  With dozens of discoveries ranging from the molecular to the nano-scale in its early years, focused its efforts on  developing and patenting a unique platform for creating inorganic-organic molecules. This process, named the Molecular Control Process  (MCP) Platform, launched the discovery of hundreds of hybrid molecules with varying structures and applications.  The discovery of a world class oxidation catalyst and its role in removing heteroatoms (sulfur, nitrogen and metals) from crude oil further  focused Auterra's efforts to design and develop a full scale, environmentally friendly process for the oil industry. The FlexUpâ„¢ Technology includes the FlexOxâ„¢  family of catalysts, the FlexDSâ„¢ chemical package, and FlexUPâ„¢ Support Services. Today, has a robust global patent portfolio protecting its technology.
has also developed several processes that improve the value of other feedstocks by removing sulfur in light feeds (FlexULS).
non-traditional clean energy company, is located in Schenectady, New York.
