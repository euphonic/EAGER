is proud to be an equal opportunity employer, MF/D/V.In 1928, the first production facility was established in this building in Cambridge, Mass.
On July 7, 1922, a great American success story began: few passionate visionaries created a high-tech venture in the shadow of a great university and developed a breakthrough product that transformed a nation.
One of the earliest technology start-ups, was established in Cambridge, Mass., home of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as the American Appliance Company.
The company's founders were Vannevar Bush, who would become dean of MIT's School of Engineering; Laurence Marshall, an engineer; and Charles Smith, a scientist who had done work on the electrical properties of gases.
Their revolutionary innovation was the gas rectifier tube, a device that eliminated one of the cumbersome expensive batteries that previously powered home radios.
The tube transformed the radio into an affordable "must-have" appliance that could be plugged into a wall socket, turning radio into a true mass medium that brought the world into America's living rooms.
quickly moved to the forefront of innovation in the electronics industry. During World War II, employees contributed to the war effort. They supplied 80 percent of the magnetron tubes used in and British radars and developed parts for the crucial proximity fuse in antiaircraft shells, among other equipment.
After the war began offering civilian products, the microwave being among the most famous. engineer Percy Spencer discovered microwave cooking when, as he stood in front of an active magnetron, a candy bar in his pocket began to melt. Intrigued, he sent out for popcorn kernels – and they began to pop. With that, a new appliance was soon on its way.
In the decades that followed, employees would build on the company's reputation for technology and innovation leadership. Today it stands as a global technology leader specializing in defense, homeland security and other government markets.
For a deeper look at the company's history, read on. You can also check out our Facebook timeline .
World War Years
met urgent production needs for magnetron tubes used by Allied forces for radar defense, and produced the Sea Going (SG) microwave surface search radar that went on Navy ships. The provided vital situational awareness in the major battles in the Pacific and helped eliminate the submarine menace in the Battle of the Atlantic.
1950s and 1960s
In the 50's and 60's, amazing innovations were everywhere. The Raytheon-guided Lark Missile knocked a test drone out of the air, becoming the first missile-mounted guidance system and continuous wave radar capable of intercepting moving objects. Raytheon, then, filled the skies with a new generation of guided missiles – including Sparrow and Hawk.
To the Moon
The 1969 lunar landing captured the world's imagination, and played a key role. For Apollo 11, built the computer that guided the space vehicles in their journey, and its on-board microwave tube transmitted radio and signals to earth, enabling millions to witness history live. The Apollo Guidance Computer gained the reputation of the most reliable digital computer of its time.
In the Persian Gulf War, Raytheon's Patriot Missile intercepted Iraqi Scuds fired at Israel and Saudi Arabia, becoming the first missile ever to engage a hostile ballistic missile in combat.
today is a unique technology and a world leader in defense electronics, with a broad range of products, service and capabilities. The proud legacies of Raytheon, E-Systems, Texas Instruments Defense, Hughes Aircraft and others have come together to form one with one vision: One global team creating trusted, innovative solutions to make the world a safer place.
