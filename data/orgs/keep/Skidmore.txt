Creative Thought Matters
"Creative Thought Matters" is not just a slogan at College—it's something
                           we believe in wholeheartedly. It is a way of life. It is a brand promise to students
                           that no matter what they choose to study, they will be active participants in an academic
                           and extracurricular environment that is richly influenced by literature, arts, culture
                           and ideas. What they learn will be brought to life by Skidmore's historic and highly
                           prized "hand and mind" tradition that values and rewards real-world actions and outcomes.

                           national, regional and local foundations and corporations for campus priorities and
                           programs. The work that we do helps the college to offer new and innovative programs,

                           faculty development initiatives. The funds – the latest in a series of major Andrew
                           Mellon Foundation grants to that have totaled nearly $8 million since 1970

                           as well as an administrative position. 
SEE-Beyond Awards invite students to explore new techniques, technologies, or modes

                           and to clarify the interrelationship between their educational and post-baccalaureate
                           goals. Awards may be used to support field or laboratory research, internships, artistic
                           residencies, workshops, apprenticeships, or productions. Projects are supported in

The Saratogian,
There would be no College were it not for a frail lady with a will of iron
                           who came to Saratoga Springs in 1900 to take the healing waters, fell in love with
                           the charms of the unique resort town and decided to remain.
The daughter of a wealthy coal merchant and widow of publishing scion Blair Scribner,
                           Lucy Scribner was almost 50 when she came to Saratoga. Deeply religious, inordinately
                           shy and physically restricted, she disliked frivolous parties and frowned on two of
                           the most popular local entertainments and industries, horse racing and gambling. She
                           decided to invest her inheritance in something more worthwhile: She would start a
                           school where young women of the town could learn skills that would make them self-supporting.
So with the help of other civic-minded neighbors, Lucy Scribner created the Young
                           Women's Industrial Club of Saratoga Springs, whose first curriculum was a blend of
                           practical courses in typewriting, bookkeeping, textile arts, physical education and
                           music and dance. Today we may snicker at the courses in sewing, shirtwaist making
                           and millinery, but these were among the few fields in which women could manage businesses,
                           and those courses were embedded in a broader context of creative expression and aesthetic
Such Growth Bespeaks the Work of Many Hands

Who wouldn’t want to go to college in Saratoga? 10-minute walk from College
                           puts you in the heart of a downtown brimming with shops, great restaurants, galleries,
 calls Saratoga Springs one of “America’s Greatest Main Streets” as well as “one of
                           the best college towns in the nation,” 
 says it’s one of the nation’s top 100 places to live, and 
There’s real history here, too: famed mineral waters, a Revolutionary War battlefield,
                           and the nation’s oldest thoroughbred racetrack. Want arts and culture? The Saratoga
                           Performing Arts Center (SPAC) is the summer home to the New York City Ballet, Philadelphia

                           Lena, the nation’s oldest continuously operating coffeehouse, a place that helped
                           launch the careers of Bob Dylan and Ani DeFranco.
The location? Boston, New York City and Montreal are no more than a three-hour car
                           ride from campus. And the nearby Adirondacks, Berkshires and Green Mountains provide
                           plenty of recreational opportunities including some of the best skiing and hiking
                           in the Northeast. New York’s state capital, Albany, is just 30 miles to the south.
An incredible place to spend four years.

friend from home came to visit me last winter. “It’s like the cafeteria on a beautiful                                        space ship,” she said.
As she took in the intricate wood and metal detailing, the ambiance of the interior                                        decor and the abundant natural light pouring in from the windows, felt a light sense                                        of pride. Seeing it through her eyes was like seeing it for my first time, too.
In that moment, realized that the Murray-Aikins Dining Hall (D-Hall) adds something irreplaceably special to my life at Skidmore. It is one of Skidmore’s                                        most brilliant gems. love it. And I’m certainly not the only one who feels this                                        way. 
It's ranked at the top  by The Princeton Review, Niche.com and others with chefs who have  repeatedly brought home gold medals in culinary competitions.
spot where you can grab a light breakfast before class or recover after a long sports                                        practice, D-Hall is here for everyone and all lifestyle varieties.
One of the reasons students are so appreciative of D-Hall is its accommodating                                        schedule.
Except for the hour between 4–5 p.m., when it is being cleaned and prepped for dinner,                                        D-Hall is open 7 a.m. – 11 p.m. during the week.
often leave campus early in the morning to hike and return late at night. Being                                        able to eat full, hot meals at those fringe times fills me with gratitude, especially                                        for the staff who wake up early and go to sleep late to feed us.
But what is the food actually like? Let me show you around.
Do you want some pizza? Then check out Supremo’s, serving hand-tossed, oven-baked                                        pizza all day. personally love the pepper and onion pies.
Looking for something healthy? Emily’s Garden is dedicated to vegan and vegetarian                                        options, and many of the meals are prepared with produce from our own community garden.
Take a few steps past Emily’s and you will find The Corner Deli, where you can order                                        your own sandwich, wrap or panini. Order anything you want. Mustard and Swiss cheese                                        on wheat? Not sure why you would want that, but I’m sure they’ll make it for you! 
After you’re done experimenting with sandwich combinations, move on to The Bakery.                                        Stocked with fresh-baked muffins, cookies, breads, pie, and cake, The Bakery is your                                        six-year-old self’s dream. Welcome to college: there are no parents. Have two chocolate                                        chip cookies instead of one. You’ll never look back.
The Diner is our main hot food station, serving everything from pork chops to tomato                                        soup, grilled cheese, burgers, baked potatoes, you name it. Every day and every meal                                        is different. The Diner is also home to Skidmore’s famous Chicken Finger Friday. Be                                        careful though, chicken fingers can be dangerous. Read what happened to this student after she ate too many.
Just around the corner from The Diner you’ll find rows and rows of cylindrical shelves                                        filled with all kinds of cereals and granolas. And don’t forget the fresh fruit.
Next up is my personal favorite: The Global Cafe. Dedicated to international foods,                                        my favorite dishes come from Global: veggie stir fry and pork fried rice. 
If you have gotten this far and your mouth isn't already watering, you will find Semolina’s:                                        our pasta station. For dinner, Semolina’s serves one kind of pasta dish. For lunch,                                        however, you can request a dish to order and our chefs and students will make you                                        a delicious custom plate. Everyone wants a spot in this line.
Lastly, if it is the case that still nothing interests you, there is a station                                        where you can cook your own eggs or omelets, or make some Belgian waffles. The only                                        limit is your imagination.
At D-Hall, no matter one’s dietary restrictions, nutritional plan, class and extracurricular                                        schedule, everyone finds accommodation. It is truly a wonderful building that has                                        facilitated so many interactions with great friends, new and old.
So far today I’ve had a veggie and chorizo scramble for breakfast and a gyro for lunch.                                        Is it time for dinner yet?
Harry is a sophomore from North Bridgton, Maine, studying history and philosophy. You will likely find him at the climbing gym, the library, the Adirondack high peaks, or his bird’s eye window seat high up in Jonsson Tower. His favorite building on campus is D-Hall and his favorite color is chartreuse.
