There would be no College were it not for a frail lady with a will of iron
                           who came to Saratoga Springs in 1900 to take the healing waters, fell in love with
                           the charms of the unique resort town and decided to remain.
The daughter of a wealthy coal merchant and widow of publishing scion Blair Scribner,
                           Lucy Scribner was almost 50 when she came to Saratoga. Deeply religious, inordinately
                           shy and physically restricted, she disliked frivolous parties and frowned on two of
                           the most popular local entertainments and industries, horse racing and gambling. She
                           decided to invest her inheritance in something more worthwhile: She would start a
                           school where young women of the town could learn skills that would make them self-supporting.
So with the help of other civic-minded neighbors, Lucy Scribner created the Young
                           Women's Industrial Club of Saratoga Springs, whose first curriculum was a blend of
                           music and dance. Today we may snicker at the courses in sewing, shirtwaist making
                           and millinery, but these were among the few fields in which women could manage businesses,
                           and those courses were embedded in a broader context of creative expression and aesthetic

One of the reasons students are so appreciative of D-Hall is its accommodating                                        schedule.
Except for the hour between 4–5 p.m., when it is being cleaned and prepped for dinner,                                        D-Hall is open 7 a.m. – 11 p.m. during the week.
often leave campus early in the morning to hike and return late at night. Being                                        able to eat full, hot meals at those fringe times fills me with gratitude, especially                                        for the staff who wake up early and go to sleep late to feed us.
But what is the food actually like? Let me show you around.
Looking for something healthy? Emily’s Garden is dedicated to vegan and vegetarian                                        options, and many of the meals are prepared with produce from our own community garden.
Take a few steps past Emily’s and you will find The Corner Deli, where you can order                                        your own sandwich, wrap or panini. Order anything you want. Mustard and Swiss cheese                                        on wheat? Not sure why you would want that, but I’m sure they’ll make it for you! 
The Diner is our main hot food station, serving everything from pork chops to tomato                                        soup, grilled cheese, burgers, baked potatoes, you name it. Every day and every meal                                        is different. The Diner is also home to Skidmore’s famous Chicken Finger Friday. Be                                        careful though, chicken fingers can be dangerous. Read what happened to this student after she ate too many.
Just around the corner from The Diner you’ll find rows and rows of cylindrical shelves                                        filled with all kinds of cereals and granolas. And don’t forget the fresh fruit.
Next up is my personal favorite: The Global Cafe. Dedicated to international foods,                                        my favorite dishes come from Global: veggie stir fry and pork fried rice. 
If you have gotten this far and your mouth isn't already watering, you will find Semolina’s:                                        our pasta station. For dinner, Semolina’s serves one kind of pasta dish. For lunch,                                        however, you can request a dish to order and our chefs and students will make you                                        a delicious custom plate. Everyone wants a spot in this line.
Lastly, if it is the case that still nothing interests you, there is a station                                        where you can cook your own eggs or omelets, or make some Belgian waffles. The only                                        limit is your imagination.
At D-Hall, no matter one’s dietary restrictions, nutritional plan, class and extracurricular                                        schedule, everyone finds accommodation. It is truly a wonderful building that has                                        facilitated so many interactions with great friends, new and old.
