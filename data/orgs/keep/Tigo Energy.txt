Highest with Long String Functionality
Tigo's TS4 Platform is deisgned to reduce costs by allowing longer strings in solar arrays which reduces the number of strings by 30% and equates to more than a $0.05/decrease in total system costs.
The product gives the customer a lower cost option to reduce any shading related issues and can increase the overall performance of a system. Our experience with thus far has been exceptional, and as a company your ability to change and manage our requirements has been exemplary, allowing us to focus on the customer needs rather than trying to make a product fit.
Steve Wallace 
Tigo's unique TS4 platform enables a choice of plug-and-play functionality to any solar module.  The TS4 platform enables different TS4 covers each with unique capabilities.  This gives installers the ability to choose from:
Integrate your modules with a smart ready junction box cover to replace and upgrade whenever needed.
Harness the data of your solar array to ensure your system is running at peak performance.
Secure the most cost-effective rapid shutdown solution via any SunSpec Alliance® signaling device.
Meet module-level Rapid Shutdown requirements and ensure the safety of everyone.
Harvest the maximum amount of from your system while also getting the most design flexibility.
Stretch string lengths to the maximum, simplify array designs, and reduce management.

The improves the data management of residential, commercial, and industrial solar systems by wirelessly communicating with smart modules. Each collects data from up to 300 TS4 units (~100ksystems) or up to 600 modules using TS4-R-X-Duo (~160ksystems). It also greatly improves safety with module-level deactivation for Rapid Shutdown. When paired with a CCA, the provides unparalleled visibility into solar installations. 
The highlights of include:
   •    High definition, sampling as low as every 2 seconds
   •    Simplified installation due to new & improved wiring compartment
“The new was developed in response to the growing demand for reliable Rapid Shutdown solutions,” says Zvi Alon, Chairman & at Tigo. “Our main goals were to improve visibility, simplify installation, and ensure safety in a communication device that can now individually collect data from hundreds of smart modules. Tigo's commercial and industrial project partners with large systems especially benefit from this cost-competitive solution in time for 2017 to take effect.”
What comprises a system with TAP?
The system has three components. First, the which wirelessly communicates with the smart modules and is hardwired to the via a RS485 cable. Second, the smart modules that are equipped with integrated (TS4-X), retrofitted/add-on (TS4-R-X), or retrofitted/add-on for 2 modules (TS4-R-X-Duo). Third, the which collects data from all system components – including modules, inverters, revenue-grade meter, etc. – and sends system information to the cloud.

each TS4 unit to act as a relay station for signals on a solar array  and extend the wireless range with the recently announced TAP
Los Gatos, CA, July 18, 2018 – Tigo®, pioneer of the smart modular Flex platform, today announced the release of its new 
 communication architecture. This state-of-the-art wireless technology directly translates to customer benefits – including simplifying the solar design process and accelerating the commissioning steps. The complete solution uses a simple yet powerful data collection technology that covers the widest ranges of residential & commercial installations at the lowest cost. With Mesh and the 
recently announced
 Access Point (TAP), customers eliminate the need to address any roof obstruction or orientation constraint. To learn more about Mesh and TAP, register for Tigo’s free, online webinar “
The Future of Solar is Wireless
Mesh compliments the full system in conjunction with 
, Cloud Connect Advanced (
), and UHD-Core 
. As the software that allows each TS4 unit to act as a relay station for signals, Mesh extends the wireless range of communication up to 230ft (70m). Mesh also allows data collection from up to 300 TS4 units (~100ksystems) using a single or from up to 900 TS4 units (~300ksystems) using a single Most importantly, Mesh supports multiple communication paths between TS4 units to minimize packet loss, improve data integrity, and increase reliability at high speed.
The benefits of Mesh include:
Easily bypassed roof or ground-mount obstructions
Fewer component accessories needed
Intelligent communication paths responsive to difficult layouts
Flexible architecture for forgiving designs with different placement of accessories
“Mesh is the groundbreaking communication technology that makes Tigo’s TS4 Platform and communication accessories the most flexible, cost-effective, and robust solution for solar arrays around the world,” says Maxym Makhota, of Software Development at Tigo. “We are thrilled to roll out this software simultaneously with the new so our customers can build and maintain efficient systems with as few costs as necessary.”
