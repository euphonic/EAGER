Corporate Brand
The corporate logo used for Industries, Inc., was first designed in 1986 to celebrate the 60th anniversary of our founding.  This symbol represents as a corporation,  the employees, the facilities and assets, products, and the message.  The characteristic single quotation marks symbolize Toray's enthusiastic attitude toward dialogue.  We strongly value communication among employees and with those outside the company,  and we desire to be a leading presence in society. The logo has symbolized for more than 20 years,  sit was first adopted to the present day. Called blue, the symbol is a deep,  chic shade of blue that signifies an intellectual refinement and precision, as well as a refined sense of fashion.  This shade is also referred to as “intelligent blue.”
The Thinking Behind Our Corporate Slogan
In April 2006 we created a new, long-term corporate vision—"AP-Innovation 21"—and adopted the corporate slogan "Innovation by Chemistry," declaring our aspiration "to become a top global corporation in advanced materials."
The word "Chemistry" has two meanings. The obvious one is the science that forms the basis for the advanced materials which we supply. The other is rapport. For us, that means maintaining a good rapport with everyone who is involved with TORAY—customers, employees, shareholders, business partners, consumers, and people in the local community—and maintaining good rapport among the companies in the group and strong connections among our business offices throughout the world.
"Innovation" is how we will realize our corporate philosophy of "Contributing to society through the creation of new value." "Innovation" refers not only to technological innovation but to our intention to pursue innovation in all aspects of our corporate activities.
"Innovation by Chemistry"
This corporate slogan declares our intention to generate positive reactions and create good rapport in all areas of our corporate activities with a focus on advanced materials, along with the specific aim to pursue innovation as part of TORAY's continuing evolution and development.
Transformation of the Corporate Symbol
The corporate symbol has been altered three times. Its evolution is outlined below.
Toyo Rayon Co., Ltd. was founded in 1926 as a producer of viscose rayon. The design of the corporate logo used at the time ? three interlocking rings placed inside a double circle, symbolized the opportunities given by heaven, the advantages of the land, and the harmony between human beings. It also represented the formation of the four letters of Faced with the Great Depression and downturns in the fiber and textile market soon after its founding, as well as post-confusion, Toyo Rayon overcame many hardships. However, as the Japanese economy recovered and developed a period of strong growth in fifties and sixties, expanded into a comprehensive manufacturer of synthetic fibers.
Bobbin style logo
After World War II, abbreviated versions of the name Toyo Rayon Co., Ltd., had become common. After considering Tore and as possible English spellings, was eventually chosen as the official abbreviation . The corporate logo was redesigned, and both internal and external stakeholders in the company favored a logo designed as a bobbin.
1970-1986
Global Having restructed of Toyo Rayon Co., Ltd. on January 1, 1970, the company was officially renamed Industries, The company's operations had, however, outgrown the name Toyo Rayon long before. At the time, was evolving from a general manufacturer of synthetic fibers into a comprehensive chemical company operating in a wide array of chemistry-oriented sectors, including plastics, fine chemicals, and pharmaceuticals. To further internationalize our business operations, it was important to move beyond "of the Orient" into a global Toray, and we took on a new corporate name and symbol to make these intentions clear.
Communicating with society at large to ensure mutual growth
In 1986, marked the 60th anniversary of its founding. Sixty years of production is a significant benchmark, and we used this occasion to introduce a company-wide "New Foundation Campaign" to guide renewal. Following the Plaza Accord signed in September 1985, the exchange rate for the Japanese yen soared, and this was a period of major change not only for the fiber and textiles industry, but also for the structure of Japanese industry as a whole. focused on restructuring its business operations and strengthening its corporate structure, as well as on expanding globally as a corporate group, by enhancing operations in the overseas production sites that had been pursued sthe 1960s. The "New Foundation Campaign" was primarily centered on reforming employee awareness, and a new corporate symbol was adopted as part of our new Corporate Identity (CI). The design, created by Colin Forbes, the founder of the design company Pentagram, was chosen for its originality and the "intelligent blue" color. The quotation marks are used as they are in English sentences to indicate dialogue and prominence. The symbol was designed to express the Group commitment to always communicate with society at large and ensure mutual growth. It also expresses the group's ambition to be a prominent presence in the 21st century.
To mark the 80th anniversary of its founding in 2006, chose "Innovation by Chemistry" as the new corporate slogan to accompany the corporate symbol.Jump to main content

Hideki Hirabayashi
Vice President, Chief Officer, Industries, Pursuing Initiatives to Position the Group as an Enterprise of High Value to All Stakeholders
The Group has from the beginning pledged to have a positive impact on society through its business and has made corporate social responsibility one of its highest management priorities, as an integral part of management philosophy.
The Group has set targets based on its Guidelines in its Road Map designed to systematically drive group-wide initiatives in the areas of corporate ethics, legal compliance, environmental preservation, human rights, human resource development, and social contribution. Social issues have been diversifying in recent years. In response, the Group aims to play an important role in securing sustainable growth and solving global challenges through its businesses, and it is committed to be an enterprise of high value to all stakeholders.

In response to this incident, the Group is redoubling its efforts to verify product safety and quality, which we see as one of the most critical of our social responsibilities. Every Group executive and employee will act fairly and with a strong sense of ethics and responsibility to be worthy of the trust and meet the expectations of society.
