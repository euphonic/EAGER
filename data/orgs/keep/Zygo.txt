. Choosing the right optical profiler system depends on your application's requirements, including speed, precision, vertical range, automation, and flexibility.
Our 3Optical Profiler instruments achieve best in class performance through advanced, patented, and differentiated technologies with superior speed, precision, resolution, and application versatility all in a single metrology instrument.
With multiple configurations that range from simple to use benchtop systems to advanced fully automated platforms, ZYGO's optical profilers have proven themselves in installations that range from R&and standards laboratories to industrial process control workstations to in-line metrology solutions.
Regardless of the installation type, our systems provide leading performance for optical measurements of surface structure and texture across varying surface scales and offer hundreds of reportable parameters, including areal surface roughness to 25178 standards as well as 2profile standards, 4287/4288.
Our instruments include several advantages based on the core technology employed, system-level features and options, software functionality, and many others.  For simplicity, we have compared our CSI-technology to two of the most common alternative optical technologies (confocal, focus variation). Highlighted below are just some of the key attributes and advantages.
• Capable of measuring super-smooth to rough surfaces
What Are Some Of the Main Markets and Applications?
In addition to the standard configurations, we have specialty models that apply in a package tailored for specific applications which include:
™ – For applications that require complete characterization of micro lenses and their alignment features, ZYGO's Compass™ system provides full surface, non-contact, 3mapping of surface form and deviation, topography, and relational/dimensional metrology of spherical or aspherical lenses and molds with sub-nanometer height precision, and millions of data points.
™ – The Nomad™ portable optical profiler is the ideal solution for measuring surfaces that are too large for the measurement stage of a conventional workstation profiler. As with our other optical profilers, the Nomad portable profiler has sub-nanometer measurement precision that is independent of field magnification.
™ – The APM650™ packaging metrology system provides automated measurement of panel-based PCBs and other advanced packaging applications. It provides both 2& 3measurements with sub-nanometer vertical precision and sub-micron lateral precision. The APM650 system features a large X/stage which accommodates panels up to 650 x 650 mm.
The performance and capability of any optical profiler is largely dependent on the lens 
 it uses. Objectives determine the magnification, working distance, slope capability, and field of view of the profiler, so choosing the right 
(s) is very important to achieving your metrology goals.

Launches Latest Generation of ZeGage Non-Contact 3Optical Profilers
Middlefield, – has announced the introduction of its latest generation of ZeGage™ 3optical profiling instruments providing precise and rapid non-contact measurement of surface topography for enhanced quality and process control.
The two new models, ZeGage Pro and ZeGage Pro , offer up to 2improvement in data points, a 50% larger maximum field of view, and increased measurement speed with simplified setup.  The ZeGage Pro systems maintain a small footprint, with versatile performance and ease of use. The new system's time-saving large field-of-view, combined with optional automated part staging, allows larger components to be measured quickly and easily in most environments.
At the core of the ZeGage Pro 3optical profiler is ZYGO's Mx™ software platform.   This comprehensive user-friendly control and analysis platform supports a broad range of surface metrology applications and data analyses. The rich suite of features includes results compliant with 25178 and 4287, image stitching, and automated measurement patterns.  The ZeGage Pro profilers now expand this offering with unique features that simplify operation and minimize operator variability, such as ZYGO's exclusive fast focus, Part Finder and Smart Setup tools.
Commenting on the launch of the ZeGage Pro and ZeGage Pro profilers , Eric Felkel, Product Manager of Optical Profilers at said, "Our latest generation of ZeGage profilers represents a new class of non-contact surface measurement system, while complementing our existing portfolio of metrology products .  It integrates our industry-leading and differentiated Coherence Scanning Interferometry (CSI) technology into a compact system, delivering fast and flexible results to meet the most stringent QC/requirements.   "The ZeGage Pro sets a new benchmark for high value, easy-to-use, non-contact metrology tools that deliver precision on the production floor, without the need for expensive vibration isolation systems or consumables," he added.
• Large format imaging sensor yields 1.9 million data points – a 50% increase in field of view and 2more data points compared to the previous generation
• SureScan™ technology reduces vibration sensitivity, providing greater flexibility in locating the instrument within a facility
• Improved data acquisition and speed;  >1.5faster than the previous generation
• Higher sensitivity and dynamic range for reliable and precise metrology on challenging surfaces (e.g. high slopes , low reflectivity, rough texture)
• Innovative and intuitive Mx™ software with "smart" features for enhanced ease-of-use, automation and productivity

 3optical profilers provide non-contact measurement and characterization of micro- and nano-scale features of virtually any surface, and set the new standard for performance, ease of use, flexibility, and precision of benchtop-class industrial non-contact surface profilers.
The base ZeGage™ Pro model delivers surface mapping at the nanometer scale, meeting the needs for most industrial surfaces.  For smoother samples, with a much finer surface finish, the ZeGage™ Pro offers more than 20higher precision with 0.15 nm vertical precision.
ZYGO's  ZeGage™ products have been taking interferometric surface profiling out of the lab and into production for nearly a decade. With the ZeGage Pro and Pro systems, powerful and trusted capabilities such as SureScan™ technology for vibration robust metrology are now paired with ZYGO's exclusive Part Finder and 
, for easy and detailed visualization to help you control your process.
Proprietary non-contact measurement technology is enhanced with SureScan™ technology for low sensitivity to vibration and easy placement anywhere within your facility.
Quantitative surface metrology with nanometer-level precision provides superior gage capability.
High resolution 1.9 million pixel image sensor provides fast areal measurements in seconds, for excellent surface detail and visualization.
Fully-automated measurement sequences and field stitching enable high resolution inspection of large areas. (Requires optional motorized part stage.)
Measures a wide variety of surface materials and parameters, including 2and 3profiling of surface texture, form, step-height and more.
Included Mx software provides comprehensive tools for surface data visualization, analysis and reporting.
Expand the measurement range of your investment with accessories that include objective turrets, manual and motorized sample stages, and optional software modules for film topography profiling and 2analysis using Cognex VisionPro®.
Smart Setup technology reduces training time, and shortens part changeover by automating part finding, light setting, and scan configuration.  Smart Setup usually results in a first data map within 1 minute of placing the sample under the objective.
Cost-effective price-to-performance ratio compares favorably to alternative systems, including mechanical contact stylus profilers.
Non-contact method means no consumable replacement costs to worry about.
