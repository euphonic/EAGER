is proud to announce its merger with Vascular and the subsequent creation of Euphrates Vascular. For more information, contact Sean Morris .
ICHOR: Percutaneous Reperfusion System
Designed to treat Acute Limb Ischemia (ALI), organized thrombus and other embolic/thrombotic events
has developed a one size fits all system that replicates the parameters of surgical embolectomy with reduced surgical or drug complications, no blood loss to aspiration, reduced bleeding complications associated with drug therapy, and eliminates the need for general anesthesia. The technology is easily adoptable by interventionalists, incorporates health economics, and specifically designed to make a first line therapy for physicians and hospitals.
ICHOR’s Panacea is a much needed technology
...for treating peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in the lower limbs. Current technologies do not deliver the desired therapeutic results, and believe the Panacea technology can deliver conclusive therapy with a design that is both elegant and intuitive. Lack of reasonable therapies will make Panacea a go-to device”
Nano-technology designed to target non-invasive therapy in Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) and other vascular occlusions
MED™ is an iron based nanoparticle influenced by external magnetic power designed to treat and diagnose conditions current technologies cannot reach. The nano size and magnetic power source can target non-invasive therapy into common diseased vasculature as well as the deepest and smallest vascular beds today’s technologies cannot even explore. This novel platform nano-technology will diagnose and/or treat a wide array of vascular occlusions in a way that is elegant yet revolutionary for physicians and patients.
In stroke, a blood vessel becomes obstructed. When the clot-busting drug is administered, the challenge is getting the medicine where it needs to go. Pulses MED™ (Magnetically-Enhanced Diffusion) overcomes this barrier with a process that may be significantly faster in reaching clots, and as a result, more effective in treating strokes.
Safe and effective products to treat vascular occlusions and achieve reperfusion
Minimally invasive systems easily adoptable by physicians, hospitals, and office based labs
Technologies aimed at transforming outcomes and the economics in treating vascular occlusions
“The Panacea device exceeded my expectations in terms of bulk retrieval of organized thrombus, the ease of maneuvering the entire low profile system using rapid exchange technique, and the durability of the device in treating large clot burden.”
“The potential of in helping physicians to have further reach, to identify areas of flow hidden by traditional means and to translate in, around and through vascular occlusions could be transformative.”
Novel technologies with 5 patents, 3 International patents, and several patents pending.
Euphrates Vascular announces clearance of the Reperfusion System ﻿
St. Louis, Missouri – Euphrates Vascular (www.euphratesvascular.com), a company focused on the treatment of vascular occlusions, recently received 510(k) clearance for sale of its Percutaneous Reperfusion System. is a Percutaneous Reperfusion System designed to treat organized thrombus and…
Euphrates Vascular is a medical device company addressing vascular occlusions related to vascular disease. Our initial areas of focus are in Limb Ischemia ($3.5market) followed by clot-related, Acute Ischemic Stroke ($1market). Our technology will also platform into Coronary, Wound, and Oncology applications.
