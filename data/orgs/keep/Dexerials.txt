Message from Top Management
To Our Shareholders and  Investors:
During fiscal year 2017, we continued to experience a severe market environment  in the main industries using our group&rsquo;s products. This severe environment in  the consumer product market resulted from the maturation of the smartphone  market and shrinking demand for tablet PCs, among other factors. 
The Group offered sales promotions for  high value-added products aimed at achieving the Medium-term Management Plan  amid this environment. We also invested in additional production capacity at  our Tochigi Technology Center to meet the brisk demand for antireflection film,  a driver of new growth.
This resulted in a substantial rebound in consolidated financial results at  every level in fiscal year 2017 compared to the previous fiscal year, in net  sales, operating profit, ordinary profit, and profit attributable to owners of  parent.
We expect the business environment in the consumer product market to remain  challenging in fiscal year 2018 as maturation of the smartphone market  progresses. 
We will strive to achieve growth in profits amid this environment, even in the  face of yen appreciation. Fiscal year 2018 is the final year of the Medium-term  Management Plan that began in fiscal year 2016. We will focus on the sale of  high value-added products to secure stable sales and profits as we also work to  achieve high growth in optical film sales and profits. 
has also positioned fiscal year  2018 as a period of preparation for achieving sustainable growth and we will  work on initiatives aimed at business expansion in fiscal year 2019 and beyond.  One of the issues confronting management over the medium and long-term is our  high dependence on the consumer product market, which experiences highly  volatile demand. Transitioning into new domains of business is essential for to achieve sustainable growth.
Our goal is to become a company that contributes to greater richness and  quality in both human society and the global environment. We will achieve this  by working actively to expand the use of products in the Life Science and  Environmental domains in addition to the automotive domain, and by providing  new value over the long-term.
would like to thank all shareholders for your continued support and interest  in the growth of the Group.

© 2012 – 2019 CorporationMar. 1962 Sony Chemicals Established.
Sony put the Japan's first transistor radio TR-55 on the market in 1955, which achieved significant downsizing with the use of transistors in place of existing vacuum tubes. The company also succeeded in developing a copper foil with adhesive for printed circuit board (PCB) for transistor radios jointly with Rubber and Asbestos Inc. in the United States (hereafter referred to as R&A). The company imported this copper foil manufactured by R&and subcontracted the processing to a domestic maker. However, in anticipation of the growing demand for transistor radios, the company signed a technical assistance contract with R&(later acquired by Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co.) to encourage domestic production. Then as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony for manufacturing and sales of copper foil products for circuits and industrial adhesive products, Sony Chemicals was founded.
Mar. 1963 Broke into the liquid adhesive domain to build up a new core business.
Sony Chemicals started production of Z782, a liquid adhesive for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) steel sheets with the opening of Haneda Plant. The company released Bondmaster "Tuff" for general-purpose adhesive for home use followed by a series of products including "Clear," "Epoxy" and "Vinyl." For industrial adhesives, as the certification of (Underwriters Laboratory) became mandatory for fixing of electronic parts in electrical appliances, chloroprene-rubber base flame retardant adhesive SC12went on sale for fixing of electronic parts, so the company expanded the business in both domains, industrial use and home use. The next year the company also pushed into the industry of sealing materials for building materials.
Apr. 1964 The Primaster production line for printed circuits  at the Haneda Plant was completed.
Production of the long-awaited copper foil with adhesive made in Japan started.
Apr. 1965 Expanded the application of bonding technologies to double coated tapes.
Sony Chemicals also moved into the double coated tapes industry. Following the introduction of home-use "Tuck Master," the industrial-use "Tuck Master" was also launched in 1967.

Fiscal year 2018 is the final fiscal year of our current mid-term management plan, and under present circumstances, the Group has positioned this year to be a run-up period for the realization of sustained growth in the times ahead. We will strengthen our measures for further business expansion while also pressing forward steadily with the transition away from dependence on the consumer domain, which we have developed as the Group's key business, and broadening the scope toward the automotive, life science, and environmental domains.
Today we see the progressive utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) in every domain.
Autonomous driving technology is evolving more rapidly than ever anticipated, for example, and the Group faces a business environment that is undergoing increasingly drastic change. However, we are going to grasp these changes in the external environment firmly and surely, and turn them toward our sustainable growth.
We express our corporate vision as “Value Matters Unprecedented innovation, unprecedented value.” Sustained by this vision, we have been constantly providing customers around the globe with functional materials that make full use of our unsurpassed capabilities in material and process technologies. We are committed to the untiring effort to continue winning the favor and the trust of our stakeholders.
We look forward to your ongoing support in realizing this commitment.
Representative Director and PresidentDexerials’ management philosophy is “Integrity - Have Integrity and Sincerity,” and in accordance with this we recognize that in order to try and improve the corporate value, and to live up to the expectations and trust placed in us by all the stakeholders who support the corporate activities, the establishment of corporate governance is an extremely important issue.
Based on this fundamental way of thinking, the management's transparency and objectivity is ensured through the composition of the board of directors, due to independent outside directors making up the majority.
Reason for Adopting the Current Structure
(“the Company”) is working to ensure management transparency by adopting a structure wherein the majority of the board of directors is made up of independent outside directors with no relationships that create a conflict of interest with regular shareholders. Furthermore, in order to invigorate debates held by the board of directors, we have instituted periodic meetings of independent outside directors and we are exchanging information and pooling awareness among independent officers.
We are strengthening supervision of management by making all audit and supervisory board members independent outside audit and supervisory board members to ensure that they can express their opinions to management from an independent and objective standpoint.
Also, by introducing an executive officer system, we have separated executive and oversight functions, improved management transparency, clarified management responsibility, and sped up decision making.
Executive Functions/Auditing and Supervision
In order to pursue efficiency and transparency through the separation of management and executive functions, the Company has adopted a structure wherein management policies and strategy, etc. are determined by the board of directors, which comprises a majority of independent outside directors, and executive authority is delegated to executive officer. Supervision of management is then conducted by observing the state of executive operations.
Furthermore, the audit and supervisory board, which is wholly made up of outside audit and supervisory board members, works with the outside directors to conduct audits from a neutral standpoint and is strengthening internal control through a system that enables the expression of opinions to management.
The Company enables prompt decision making and transparency of executive responsibility by selecting eleven executive officers and delegating authority to them.
Executive officers comprise three internal directors and eight staff.
Furthermore, in principle, the Company conducts twice-monthly meetings of the board of executive officers, which comprises the eleven executive officers as regular members. The board of executive officers examines the status of executive operation as well as issues being faced, in addition to conducting discussion of major proposals in advance of a meeting of the board of directors.
The outside audit and supervisory board members exchange ideas with representative directors, attend important meetings, access to important documents, survey important assets, participate in department hearings, and investigate subsidiary companies, while at the same time coordinating with the internal audit department and independent auditors to enhance the audit's effectiveness and efficiency.
The internal audit department holds monthly meetings at which it confirms the content of audits and exchanges opinions. Furthermore, it works with the independent auditors by receiving explanations of auditing plans from and conducting quarterly opinion exchanges.
Status of Internal Audits
Dexerials’ Internal Audit Department strives to implement an effective and efficient audit, establishes an internal control system, for and its group companies, and audits the status of their implementation of and compliance with their respective compliance and risk management system, and also in regards to the results of the internal audit, periodically reviews the status of enhancements, and reports those details to the representative director and president, the audit and supervisory board and any related departments.
Specifically, it conducts internal audits based on the auditing plan devised at the beginning of the fiscal year, notifies audited departments of the results of audits, and reports those results to the representative director and president and the audit and supervisory board. It also checks the status and results of improvements with regard to content that requires improvement.
Audit and supervisory board members hold monthly meetings at which they confirm the content of audits and exchange opinions.
Also, they conduct quarterly opinion exchanges with the independent auditors, provide information to the independent auditors in relation to major events relating to internal control that are discovered in the course of internal audits, and receive instructions and advice if necessary.
Directors and Board of Directors
Dexerials’ Board of Directors consists of three internal directors and four outside directors; meaning that outside directors comprise the majority of board members. In principle, the board of directors conducts regular meetings once per month, where it decides legally mandated matters, determines major management policies and strategies, selects candidates for officers, determines individual remuneration, and oversees execution of business.
The outside directors each have extensive experience and knowledge as managers or experts in their field and are able to perform their supervisory functions from an independent perspective.
Basic Policy and Procedures for Nomination of Candidates for Director
With regard to the nomination of candidates for director, the Company selects candidates that possess judgement and ability in accordance with the Company’s corporate philosophy, who have exceptional personal and communication skills, and who display leadership abilities, etc. Furthermore, outside directors are people that are invited from outside the Company with management experience at global corporations, knowledge concerning technological development, and specialist knowledge in fields such as law and financial accounting, and who possess a high degree of independence. Also, outside directors are determined in consideration of the balance of the knowledge, experience, and specialist areas, etc. of the board of directors as a whole.
The majority of the Company’s board of directors is made up of independent outside directors, so it calls for the selection of candidates for director from a more neutral standpoint. Also, we conduct prior consideration through meetings of independent outside directors when nominating candidates for director, in order to reflect the opinions of independent outside directors.

Masao Hirano's Perspective on Activities
© 2012 – 2019 CorporationThe following section describes certain risks which could potentially have a material impact on our business, financial condition and the results of our operations, but it is not intended to be an exhaustive list of the risks we face. In addition, it is possible that risks which are currently considered immaterial or even unknown could turn out to be material in the future as the business environment changes.
This  section includes forward-looking statements and future expectations as of June  22, 2018.
The markets for our products are subject to significant competition. Our competitors may have advantages over us in areas such as research and development, production capacity, financial strength and human resources. Customers of our products such as the manufacturers of displays and assembled products, who also face severe competition in their respective markets, may among other things terminate or reduce orders for our products, whether to adjust product quality or reduce costs, or as a result of their corporate reorganization or a change in their business strategies. If we are unable to compete effectively in the markets in which we sell our products, our market share could decrease and this could result in a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.
We conduct our business globally with production bases in Japan, China, Europe and the United States, and we are actively looking to expand our operations throughout the world, and a substantial portion of our net sales is derived from international sources. As a part of our future growth strategies, we are aiming to further increase our net sales derived from international sources. Our international operations and business are subject to risks accompanying international business in general, including:
risks related to political instability and uncertainties in the business and economic environment;
governmental regulations, including environmental and safety regulations and other regulations related to the import, export, production and use of our products;
difficulties associated with managing local personnel and increases in labor costs;
higher tariffs and duties, and stricter trade regulations;
unexpected enactments and changes in laws, regulations, policies and taxation, and divergences in the interpretation and application thereof;
unstable infrastructure leading to disruptions or delays in basic services such as electricity, transportation and communication;
varying standards and practices in the legal, regulatory and business cultures in which we operate; and
acts of terrorism, war, epidemics, boycotts stemming from international political relations and other sources of social disruption.
Any one or more of the foregoing factors or others could increase our costs, reduce our income or disrupt our operations, resulting in a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.
(3) M&and Business Alliance
We consider the strategic investments such as M&As and business alliances as one of our growth strategies, and therefore, we may make such strategic investments for the purpose of entrance into a new market, development of our operations in new business areas and others. Although we will conduct the detailed research of the target company and the sufficient risk analysis upon our strategic investment, any issues that we cannot recognize in advance may arise or our operations may not be developed as we originally plans, which could result in a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and our financial condition.
Since we are actively looking to expand our operations throughout the world, demand for our products may be materially affected by worldwide economic conditions and financial crises. Related end-product markets for many of our products, such as the markets for smartphones and tablet PCs in which our products are used, are influenced by changes in the economic environment and are subject to inherent cyclicality. An economic slowdown experienced by one or more significant economies, including China or other developing economies, economic turmoil triggered by lower crude oil prices, continued instability in the financial or banking sectors in Europe or elsewhere, the failure or premature termination of government stimulus or monetary easing programs (particularly by Japan or other developed economies), lower consumer spending in Japan as a result of a proposed increase in the consumption tax rate, or political instability in the Middle East, Southeast Asia or other regions, could cause or contribute to a broader and longer global economic downturn. The nature of our business as a manufacturer makes it difficult to rapidly adjust our fixed costs downward when demand for our products declines, which could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.
(5) Supplies of Raw Materials
While we have established our manufacturing and processing operations based on our ability to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials on a timely basis, we rely on the limited number of third-party suppliers with respect to a portion of our raw materials. Despite of our efforts to reduce risks of not being able to obtain key raw materials, by among other things entering into supply agreements with two or more third-party suppliers, it is difficult for us to obtain all types of raw materials from two or more suppliers. If any of our suppliers are unable to meet their obligations under our present or future supply agreements due to any factors such as delays, or insufficient supply in their supply chains, or increases in the prices of the raw materials to be provided to us, or if any of our key supply agreements is terminated earlier than we anticipate, we may be forced to postpone delivery dates for our products or be forced to purchase raw materials in the open market or from alternative suppliers, and no assurances can be given that we would be able to make those purchases or make them at prices or quality levels that would allow us to remain competitive or deliver our products as anticipated. Our business may also be impacted by sudden increases in raw material prices or fuel surcharges, and we may not be able to adjust our prices and thereby pass along such rising costs to our customers. In addition, natural disasters, accidents, customer bankruptcies and other factors that may impact our suppliers or transportation networks, including unexpected supply limitations or increased costs for key raw materials, as well as short supply or price increase related to the electricity, may negatively impact our operations. Any or all of such events could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.
(6) Financial Condition of Customers and End-Product Manufacturers
We are exposed to credit risk in relation to our customers and to the end-product manufacturers that purchase our customers’ products, including insolvency and bankruptcy risks, which may be caused by a drastic change in business environments or other factors. Although we have programs in place to monitor and mitigate those risks, such programs may not be effective in reducing our exposure. To the extent one or more of our customers becomes insolvent or seeks protection from its creditors, we may not be able to collect money due to us, which may negatively impact our operating results. Also, the loss of an end-product manufacturer due to insolvency or bankruptcy could cause for us the loss of one or several of our customers, which may negatively impact our operating results.
(7) Research and Development
The business areas in which we operate are subject to significant competition in connection with technologies and costs, and we engage in continuous research and development and make the capital investments that we believe are necessary and appropriate to develop new technologies and new products, identify new uses for existing products and technologies, develop new markets for our products and enhance our manufacturing processes in keeping with our mid-term development strategies. However, it is difficult for us to predict what events and conditions may occur in the future that could affect our business because the market conditions for our products have been changing, and will be change, very rapidly. We also may be unable to produce desired results (such as meeting sales targets) in connection with the products newly developed by us. If any of our competitors develop new technologies or products that are more attractive to our customers, our products could be rendered obsolete or demand for our products could decrease. Similarly, end-products may evolve or be replaced by other new types of end-products in a manner that reduces the need for our products as components and materials, or the standards for products like ours or the needs of our customers may change to an extent that is beyond our capacity to adapt. In addition, because most of our customers and end-product manufacturers have very specific needs regarding specifications for product performance, we frequently collaborate with our customers to develop customized products that meet such needs. If we are unable to continue to offer products that meet the specifications of our customers or end-product manufacturers, our customers may choose alternate suppliers. Demand for our products is also affected by our ability to meet our customers’ expectations in terms of the pricing for our products, our ability to quickly respond to new orders and produce and deliver the desired quantities of products according to schedule, and our ability to provide long-term and high quality after-sale support. As a result of any of the foregoing events, the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected.
(8) Dependence on Limited Number of Products, Including Display-Related Products
We rely heavily on our ability to sell components for use in displays. While we are currently endeavoring to expand the uses for our products to include applications in end-products other than displays, there is no assurance that we will be successful in creating new demand for our products through such initiatives. If demand levels decline for the display industry as a whole, or with respect to the display products in which our products are used, before we become successful in creating new demand or identifying new uses for our products, the results of our operations may be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we have continuously derived a significant portion of our net sales and operating income from sales of certain key products. Any adverse development relating to those products, including the use of technologies that could replace those products, or the introduction of superior products by our competitors, could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.
Certain factors relating to display manufacturers, such as changes in their business or sales strategies, may also affect the results of our operations. Furthermore, the number of established smartphone and tablet manufactures in the market is limited, and the timing of their respective new product introductions and the demand for their products, as well as the changes in their business or sales strategies, could affect, in turn, the demand for our products.
We are manufacturing highly functional materials, especially, optical materials and electronic components. Due to the nature of our operations, we are subject to business trends that impact middle-size and small-size displays and certain types of electronic components used in end-products such as smartphones, tablet PCs and laptop PCs. The results of our operations may be affected by the timing of releases of new models and the sales of end-products that include our products and the related orders of our key customers. We generally experience higher demand in the three-month periods ended September 30 and December 31 due to the impact of the production of end-products targeting the holiday shopping season at the end of the year and the Chinese New Year. As a result of these factors, our product sales may vary significantly on a year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter basis and the results of our operations may be influenced accordingly.
We own, maintain and manage various forms of intellectual property. If we are not able to adequately protect any of our intellectual property as a result of, among other things, any disruption or insufficient protections in certain jurisdictions, or the unauthorized duplication or replication of our intellectual property, the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition to intellectual property owned by us, we have also entered into license agreements with manufacturers, including our major competitors. However, there is a possibility that such arrangements will be unexpectedly terminated or may only be available in the future on less favorable terms for us, or our competitors may obtain licenses on more favorable terms than we do. Additionally, from time to time, we may be subject to intellectual property disputes, legal proceedings and claims which could cause us to incur significant costs and may prevent us from developing or manufacturing our products. business combination or partnership between us and a third party could also result in our business becoming subject to new restrictions under license agreements to which such third party is bound.
(11) Issues Pertaining to Product Quality
While we constantly strive to implement international-standard quality control measures in our operations, and our products are generally sold to other manufacturers (not individual consumers), product failures could cause us to incur substantial expenses to repair or replace defective products, or to compensate our customers for defects caused in end-products. If we deliver products with errors or defects, our credibility, customer relations and business reputation could be harmed and the sales and market share of our products could decline. Although we carry product liability insurance, there is no guarantee that our insurance will adequately cover us against potential liability. If not, the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any product liability claims brought in connection with any alleged defect of our products, whether with or without merit, could increase our product liability insurance rates or prevent us from securing continuing coverage at rates we could afford. In particular, in connection with new domains such as the Automotive and Life Sciences, our group may be subject to massive recalls or reputational risks resulting from product liability claims, which could adversely affect the results of our operations and our financial condition.
Our handling, processing, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations at the local, national and international level. Such environmental laws and regulations include those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air, global-warming greenhouse gases, and the management and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. While environmental preservation is one of our important group policies and we voluntarily establish and make efforts to implement appropriate action plans, we cannot assure that such plans will be adequate or effectively implemented as we expect. If any environmental pollution occurs in connection with our operations due to an accident or natural disaster, or if any contaminant is found on sites currently or formerly owned or operated by us, the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, any changes in environmental laws or regulations could restrict our ability to operate as we are currently operating or, impose additional costs, which could adversely affect the results of our operations. Our non-compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations also could have a negative impact on the results of our operations.
Our business is operated not only within Japan but also outside Japan, and we are subject to the regulatory regimes of each country in which we operate, including, among others, those relating to anti-trust, anti-corruption, corporate governance, labor, consumer safety, energy generation and taxation. Although we have internal control and compliance systems in place for the purpose of complying with such laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that such systems and our other efforts to promote compliance will be effective. If we violate any applicable law or regulation or fail to satisfy the conditions or comply with the restrictions imposed by our licenses, permits and governmental approvals, or the restrictions imposed by any statutory or regulatory requirements, we may become subject to regulatory enforcement actions or be subject to fines, penalties or additional costs or revocation of governmental approvals, permits or licenses. We may also incur significant costs associated with enhancing our compliance functions as regulations and laws change in the countries in which we operate, which may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations.
We may become a party to various types of litigation or other claims and legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Since we operate our business throughout the world, we may be subject to the risk of unexpected litigation in jurisdictions within and outside of Japan. If the cost to defend such litigation is significant, or if any adverse judgments are rendered with respect to any or all of those legal matters, the results of our operations may be materially and adversely affected.
(15) Leaks of Confidential Information
We store and manage confidential information regarding technology, research and development, manufacturing, sales and operating activities, relating to both our company and our customers, in various forms. While we have implemented systems to protect and manage confidential information, there can be no assurance that our systems will continuously prevent unauthorized access or leaks of confidential information in the future. If any confidential information stored or managed by us is improperly disclosed, or if third parties improperly use or gain access to such confidential information, we may be subject to claims for damages, and our reputation and credibility and the results of our operations could be materially and adversely affected.
(16) Accidents and Natural Disasters
We operate our business with an emphasis on safety, implementing safety, security and business continuity plan measures in the hope of reducing the likelihood of accidents and harm from natural disasters. However, not all threats to safety or their consequences can be fully avoided. In particular, Japan is a location that experiences frequent earthquakes, and large earthquakes may result in physical damage to our facilities as well as human injury caused by the fires, radiation and other harmful effects of earthquakes. If we choose to consolidate to a larger extent our operations in Japan, such risks may increase. Large natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis and floods could also endanger or make more costly power and gas supplies, transportation networks and other infrastructure, which might damage one or more portions of our supply chain, including with respect to our procurement of raw materials necessary for the production of our products and delivery of our products to our customers, all of which may disrupt our business operations.
Furthermore, due to the locations of our own operations, and those of our customers, in places within and outside of Japan, we may be subject to business disruption risks. In addition to the risks related to natural disasters, we may subject to other risks such as computer viruses, riots and labor disputes, wars and the like, any or all of which could severely reduce our business prospects. Although we carry disaster and accident insurance, our coverage is limited and therefore a serious disaster or accident may materially and adversely affect the results of our operations. Factors that adversely affect the world economy, such as pandemics involving lethal diseases, may also harm the results of our operations.
(17) Decreases in Prices for Our Products
We are continuously making efforts to add value to, and improve the quality of, our products, and we work to maintain and increase the price competitiveness of our products. We are also trying to offset a necessary decrease in the prices of our products through the cost-cutting measures such as by streamlining our manufacturing processes to improve manufacturing yield. However, due to constant pricing pressures from our customers, as well as overproduction or demand decreases in the market for optical materials and electronic components, or the entrance into the market of high quality products by other manufacturers, or requests by customers for price reductions, the sustainable price for our products may fall beyond the savings achieved through our cost-cutting measures, or our sales of higher-margin products may decrease, as a result of which our profitability and the results of our operations may be materially and adversely affected.
We conduct business in various regions throughout the world, and the prices for our products and services and our costs that are denominated in foreign currencies such as dollars are influenced by fluctuations in exchange rates, and therefore, currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect the results of our operations. We may engage in hedging transactions and other arrangements to minimize exchange rate risk, but there can be no assurance that such arrangements will be sufficient to protect us against adverse movements in foreign exchange rates. In addition, since we convert the foreign currency-based figures (including the assets and liabilities) of our foreign group companies into Japanese yen in the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, currency exchange rate fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect our financial condition.
(19) Retirement Benefit Plans
Costs and obligations related to our retirement benefit plans have been calculated based on the actuarial assumptions and expected returns relating to our pension plan assets. If the actual results differ from our assumptions or if there are any changes in those assumptions, the results of our operations may be adversely affected.
(20) Impairment of Fixed Assets
We have various fixed assets including tangible fixed assets and goodwill. We regularly review fixed assets to assess the probability of recovering the remaining carrying value of such assets from the cash flow generated from such assets. If we find that any of our assets no longer generate a sufficient amount of cash flow, for example due to intensifying competition in our industry or other factors that are expected to negatively affect our profitability, we would be required to recognize an impairment loss. Any impairment of fixed assets would negatively impact our financial condition and the results of our operations.
It is important for our business operations to secure qualified researchers, engineers and highly skilled production facility operators. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, or an inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. In addition, if key personnel were to leave us to work for a competitor, to the extent they take their knowledge and technical know-how to the competitor, such knowledge and know-how could improve such competitor’s ability to compete with us, as a result of which the results of our operations may be materially and adversely affected.
(22) Recoverability of Deferred Tax Assets
Deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that future taxable income, which we estimate on a reasonable basis, will be available against which deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized. From time to time, we re-estimate our future taxable income taking into account certain factors such as changes in our business environment, and, through such re-estimation process, we may determine that all or part of our deferred tax assets will be unrecoverable. In such a case, the amount of our deferred tax assets may decrease and the results of our operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected.menu
