1-transistor Bi-(bi-stable, BiCMOS) provides a static memory cell with 5x smaller cell size. It is bi-stable, hence does not require refresh operation, and is compatible with logic process.
βoosted transistor technology results in 4x gain in power-performance product within the same technology node.
Dr. Widjaja graduated with Ph.in Chemical Engineering with minor in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University. He held engineering and management positions at Silicon Storage Technology upon graduation, most recently served as Program Manager in Technology Development. He currently holds more than 50 patents.
Serial entrepreneurs with over 30 years of experience. Mr. Or-Bach is the founder of Chip Express, eASIC, and Monolith3Inc. He received the EETimes Innovator of the Award in 2005 for his invention of the first Structured architecture, as well as a finalist for the award in 2011 and 2012 for his pioneering work on monolithic 3D-IC.
Stefan K.Lai, Ph.D.
Member of Technical Advisory Board
Dr. Lai is the co-inventor of tunnel oxide (ETOX) flas memory cell, which has become the industry standard. He was appointed Vice President of Intel’s Technology and Manufacturing Group in 2000, where he led the development of non-volatile memory technology including phase change memory, and retired from Intel at the end of 2006. He was the VP, Business Development of Ovonyx, Inc. from February 2007 to July 2008.
