Nurse Elise Sørensen was concerned by the dramatic change in her sister’s lifestyle following an ostomy operation. Thora no longer dared to go out, fearing that her stoma would leak in public. Elise was determined to help her sister out of her isolation.
She came up with the idea of an ostomy bag with an adhesive ring, which would make it fit tightly to the skin. This would prevent leakage and give her sister – and thousands of people like her – the chance to return to their normal life.
Today, we're headquartered in Denmark and have locations in 40 different countries, but what unites us is our curiosity. We are guided by Elise's passion and commitment.

Based on Elise’s idea, Aage Louis-Hansen, a civil engineer and plastics manufacturer, and his wife Johanne Louis-Hansen, a trained nurse, created the ostomy bag. An ostomy bag that helps Thora – and thousands of people like her – to live the life they want to lead.

To our End Users...
products improve the lives of people with intimate health care needs around the world.
Who are we to our End Users?
Listening and responding to the needs of our customers is what drives our work. The feedback that we get from end users is used in as input to the development and testing of new products and new services. For example, many have told us that discretion, security and convenience are very important. To accommodate this we’ve made products that don’t necessarily look like medical devices.
Our products are subject to tough quality requirements that follow key international legislation and standards. is 9001/13485 certified and we comply with legislation from the FDA, the and other relevant authorities. We also document the safety of our products through several testing methods. One standard method in the healthcare industry is animal testing. In some cases these are necessary, so we can’t completely avoid them. However, we do try to limit them as much as possible as stated in our animal testing policy. In 2011/12 we conducted 921 animal tests. 
Read our policy on Animal Testing
New products are evaluated thoroughly before being sent to the market. First, they are tested in the laboratory, including the use of computer models and cell research. If results are promising, the product might then be evaluated on humans in clinical studies.
clinical studies are carefully planned to make sure that participants are protected and that the research yields valid results. The protocol – a detailed plan for the study – is reviewed and approved by an independent ethics committee before studies can go ahead. As outlined in our publication policy, our clinical studies are conducted in accordance with internationally accepted ethical and scientific quality standards such as the 
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects
We publish the results for summary results of all registered clinical studies for marketed products on

To our Healthcare Professionals...
Apart from the end user, no-one knows the needs of people using ostomy bags, catheters or wound dressings better than people working professionally within health care.
Who are we to our Healthcare Professionals?
Healthcare Professionals
It is vital for to listen to nurses, doctors and other healthcare professionals and to involve them in the development and testing of new products and services.
When we interact with healthcare professionals questions may arise on what exactly is appropriate conduct. For example, "At what type of venue should a meeting be held?" Or, "What kind of gift should give my nurse to thank her for her feedback?"  Coloplast’s Code of Conduct outlines our approach to interacting with healthcare professionals and states that any relationship with healthcare professionals must be strictly professional and that we must respect their independence. Any support for travel, conferences, accommodation and so on must be modest. We must always make sure that any fee paid to healthcare professionals can never be perceived as a financial incentive.
Our people know the rules
We’re particularly proud of the massive coverage we’ve been able to achieve with our compliance training. Our mandatory Code of Conduct e-learning course for example has been made available in 15 languages in over 35 countries – and nearly 95% of our white-collar employees have now completed it.
Sponsorships and donations for health care professionals
is dedicated to supporting the education of healthcare professionals in the fields relevant to our work, that is, ostomy, surgical urology, continence care, and wound and skin care. This includes sponsorships and donations to professional medical organizations as well as support for research, training seminars, educational materials and congressional participation.
For example, the sponsored Dialogue Study is a global clinical study designed to document real-life experiences of Coloplast’s SenSura ostomy end-users, focusing on skin condition and quality of life. The Dialogue Study aims to enroll 5,000 patients worldwide, making it the largest clinical study ever undertaken in ostomy care.
basic principle of donations to healthcare professionals is that it should be strictly professional and that we must respect the independence of the healthcare professionals. Accepting donations from always means no strings attached.

What is our responsibility to the environment?
Responsibilities to the environment 
Minimizing our impact
By making smart choices and small changes, we're making a big difference:
Fewer Materials- Smaller products give our end users the discretion they want and lower our environmental impact
Recycling Plastic- Waste from our 
SpeediCath® production is recycled into plastic tiles and soles of shoes in China
New packaging in our SpeediCath® Upgrade has 50% less aluminum which saves 150 soda cans per user every year
We’re recycling the leftover silver from the production waste of our Biatain® Ag wound care dressings
Our growth as a company doesn't mean a larger global footprint 
 From the moment we start developing a new product, we consider the environment.  We continuously evaluate our product development process to ensure it has  the lowest environmental impact possible. Our choices in raw materials and methods of production and disposal help reduce the impact on the environment:
Raw materials
Being mindful of our choices of raw materials is where we see our biggest environmental impact. Commonly used materials include oil to make plastic and aluminum for packaging. We reduce our use of raw materials as much as possible.
When it comes to product production, energy efficiency is key. This year, we achieved an absolute CO2 reduction of 3% from our production facilities and warehouses. We've set an ambitious target to reduce our CO2 output by 10% by 2013/14 (with a baseline from 2010). Among our other ambitions is to reduce the amount of product we transport by air. This change by itself is expected to reduce our CO2 emissions by 4,000 tons.
Due to infection risks, we do not recommend recycling products. However, this doesn't mean that we don't do our part. We focus on reducing the amount of production waste, and when when it's possible, we recycle. This year we've reduced the amount of waste per product by 10%
Environmental Awareness from the start
During product development, we assess the environmental impact of the  materials and processes we are using. We often succeed in finding new ways of  doing things that reduce environmental impact.
We carry out a so-called lifecycle screening, assessing the environmental  impact of our products from production to use and disposal, including related  issues such as transport and packaging.
Our environmental specialists  work alongside engineers and pharmacists during product development, they advise  the development team and make suggestions for materials, chemicals and designs  based on environmental considerations.
Plastic isn't just plastic
We develop, manufacture and market medical devices for people with intimate  healthcare needs. Plastic is a suitable material for many of these products  because it is flexible, lightweight and impervious. Plastic is also useful for  packaging our products as it keeps out dirt and bacteria.
We take into consideration a wide range of environmental factors:
Raw materials
Most plastics are made from natural resources that can only be  renewed slowly, such as crude oil and natural gas, so we try to make the most of  the raw materials we use and avoid waste.
The materials our suppliers use to manufacture certain  types of plastic can be hazardous if handled incorrectly. We assess our supply  chain to make sure that workplaces are safe.
Additives help make our products flexible, noise and odor-free, and enable us to provide a wide range of tailored product choices. The use of some  additives is controversial, such as DEHP, a plasticizer used in We no  longer permit the use of in new product development. DEHP-free  products include the popular SpeediCath catheter and Security+ urine bags.
To our suppliers...
We work to make sure that our quality standards and responsibility efforts are extended and improved throughout the supply chain.
Who are we to our suppliers?
Responsibilities to our suppliers
We expect that our direct suppliers meet our quality, social, environmental,  business, and ethical standards.
employees involved in procurement must abide by the 
for procurement, which outlines our approach to avoiding bribes and describes  questions of confidentiality, conflict of interest, negotiations, gifts and  personal benefits.
Before engaging with a new supplier, we ask the supplier to fill out a  pre-award questionnaire, covering key areas of our responsibility policies. Our  purchasers also occasionally conduct site visits, which provide an opportunity  for us to help suppliers live up to Coloplast’s standards. In other words,  dialogue is our main tool.
In addition to site visits, conducts formal supplier audits with  the intent to document compliance or non-compliance with our quality,  environmental and social standards. Typically, quality audits are conducted by  employees while an external auditor conducts the social and  environmental audits.
