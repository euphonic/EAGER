Tokyo, November 29, 2018 - Aiming to implement continued investments in order to get back on the track to growth under the Mid-term Management Plan 2020, (NEC; TSE: 6701) is introducing significant reforms to its profit structure.

These measures will allow to streamline its workforce by approximately 3,000 personnel, and are expected to improve earnings by approximately 24.0 billion yen on an annualized basis.

The cost of implementing this measure will be approximately 20.0 billion yen, recorded as business structure improvement expenses for the third quarter of the fiscal year ending March 2019 (nine months ending December 2018). This cost has already been taken into account for the consolidated financial forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2019.
