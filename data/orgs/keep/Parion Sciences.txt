is a development stage company dedicated to research, development, and commercialization of treatments to restore patient’s innate mucosal surface defenses. In the eye and in the lung, our layer of protective mucus plays an important role in keeping our bodies healthy. Sometimes though, either through genetics, aging or environmental stimulus, our innate mucosal defense system can become compromised. Parion’s science driven technologies target respiratory, ocular and other epithelial diseases resulting from deficiencies of the innate host defenses.
is committed to providing effective treatments for diseases with unmet medical needs. Our company was originally founded on advancing our proprietary epithelial sodium channel (“ENaC”) blockers for pulmonary disease. In addition to advancing ENablockers for pulmonary diseases, is leveraging our research and development expertise in epithelial biology to expand into new mechanisms, indications, and approaches.
