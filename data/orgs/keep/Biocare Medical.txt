What Our Customers Say
cannot tell you how invaluable that is for people just starting out with IHC!!!
 Also need to say thank you for your generosity with supplies from your company, it really says a great deal about the quality of your research company and their willingness to support their customers
- Research Lab at Seattle Children’s
            has excellent technical service and support; it is not always the standard when getting lab equipment serviced, or problems addressed. Our problem was addressed within three days, and 
am continually impressed by the knowledge and the professionalism that has shown when we have needed them.
 They deserve a pat on the back! Hopefully we won’t need anyone to come in for awhile after this!
What you guys did was so helpful for us it lifted a big road block in our progress towards our grant aims.
 It has won your company in my opinion a great loyalty from our lab for using your products. 
have never had such great customer service in my career.
- Research Lab at Seattle Children’s
            On behalf of the Group here would like to thank you all for fixing our Nemesis quickly. 
was absolutely wonderful.
 was thorough, careful and troubleshooting was excellent. The team ran a large validation run last night with great success! It looks like we will be able to meet our study deadline which will put smiles on a lot of faces!
