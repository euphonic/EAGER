Intellectual Property Security Policy
We are entering an era in which reusable intellectual property (IP) is rapidly becoming essential to the design of advanced semiconductors. This presents opportunities as well as challenges to developers, semiconductor designers, and foundries. Among the most basic issues is the security of - how its integrity and its content can be preserved and protected throughout a complex process that begins from an idea to the finished product.
This document represents our formal commitment to 
. The policies on how is handled by employees and how we audit compliance with these policies are described in detail. We will gladly respond to any of your questions regarding these policies and are eager to hear your suggestions on how they can be improved.
