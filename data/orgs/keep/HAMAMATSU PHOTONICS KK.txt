Took up further challenges in very low-light-level measurement and single photon detection.
Succeeded in conducting Young's interference experiment with single photons.
Using the (Photon-counting Image Acquisition System), we conducted Young's double-slit interference experiment in the single photon counting region. This demonstrated that an interference pattern appeared by detecting individual photons one by one and then integrating them to create an image. The experimental results indicated that one photon passed through the double slit at the same time (wave interference) and then created one bright spot on the detector (particle’s photoelectric effect). Integrating each bright spot resulted in an image of interference fringes which clearly demonstrated dual properties of light (light is both a wave and a particle). The imaging system used for this experiment was named one of the “10 Great New Products 1984” by Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun in Japan and also earned an R&Award from R&Magazine in the This definitely proved that our low-light-level measurement technology was highly appreciated both domestically and abroad.

First starting from the founding of Tokai Electronics Laboratory in 1948, Co., Ltd. was then established in 1953 followed by a company name change to in 1983. All through this period and up to the present day, we here at have been continually pursuing technologies involving “light” in all its aspects. Take a look along with us at the history of our company constantly pursuing the path of light since our founding.
Founding of the firm: Starting to challenge the possibilities of light
Heihachiro Horiuchi founded Tokai Electronics Laboratory.
Project was launched amidst the ruins after the war with the dream of developing photoelectric devices.
Heihachiro Horiuchi founded Tokai Electronics Laboratory.
Project was launched amidst the ruins after the war with the dream of developing photoelectric devices.
Being fascinated by the wonder of light since the elementary school days, our founding president Heihachiro Horiuchi studied Electrical Engineering at Industrial High School (now the Faculty of Engineering of Shizuoka University) as a student of Kenjiro Takayanagi who was one of the world’s pioneers of television technology research, and was greatly inspired by “Takayanagi-ism” after receiving his guidance and instruction. During the World War 2, Heihachiro Horiuchi worked on developing and manufacturing night-vision tubes in Tokyo and then in Yamagata in the northern region of Japan where the factory was evacuated due to bombing. However, when the war ended he had to completely restart his career. He returned to in the post-war chaos and made a decision to utilize the photoelectric technology he had learned before and during the war. In 1948, he bought a factory site at 456 Ebitsuka-cho, City, and established Tokai Electronics Laboratory.

Developed the PV26 phototubes that were used for automatic on/off street light switching.
Established Co., Ltd. with the dream of linking optical technology with industry.
Established Co., Ltd. with the dream of linking optical technology with industry.
Horiuchi decided to pursue the “path of light” by providing society with a means or namely products that would make effective use of light and he worked on developing photoelectric devices. In early 1951, Horiuchi’s efforts began to show signs of success as a promising inquiry came in for phototubes later called the PV29 and PV26 that he first worked on. At that point in time, Horiuchi was planning to dissolve Tokai Electronics Laboratory into another organization, and so he convinced Teruo Hiruma and Norio Hanyu, who he knew through his elder brother Yuji Takahashi (then Professor at Industrial High School), to participate in his plan to establish a new company. This gave rise to the founding of Co., Ltd.
Developed an underwater camera as our first video camera product.
Started finding applications in scientific and industrial fields.
Started finding applications in scientific and industrial fields.
We became involved in television applications in the fields of science and industry when we were asked by Professor Nobuyuki Kawamoto of Mie University to make an underwater camera for observing fish reefs. That was our first attempt to make a television camera. Preliminary experiments were successful and reported in newspaper, but the actual experiment with the camera loaded on the experimental ship did not succeed unfortunately. Nevertheless, this first attempt to make a television camera was a significant step as our first field experiment.
Our first mass-production line started up.
Our first mass-production line started up.
Up until that point, had always been involved in electron tube products such as phototubes. Our first foray into semiconductor products was the Cdcell. After a hard struggle and repeated trials and errors, an employee succeeded in developing the product .  One day at the end of 1958, an order came in for 1,000 Cdcells per month for use in adjusting the brightness of television cathode ray tubes. As a company that had up until that time been producing multiple products in small lots, it was our first experience with mass production, and we had to mobilize all of our employees on the production side to get the order filled. The development of the Cdcell ended up bringing about many positive outcomes, among them an accumulation of semiconductor technology and a new sense of unity in-house, after all of the employees had worked together day and night on the production effort.

Succeeded in developing photomultiplier tubes that are still our main products.
Succeeded in developing photomultiplier tubes that are still our main products.
Among various types of photodetectors, photomultiplier tubes offer superior features such as extremely high sensitivity and fast time response. Around 1955, chemical analysis instruments using photomultiplier tubes began to be manufactured and demand for them also increased in Japan. However, most of such equipment was imported from overseas at that time.Around that time, one of our customers said to us, "If could produce photomultiplier tubes, we would call you the 'king' of the industry." That made our engineers realize the necessity for development of these tubes, and provided the motivation for them to undertake the project. The photomultiplier tube that they developed through many trials and tribulations was far superior to those of other companies, and that product was what gave us a solid footing as an opto-technology company.

Business expansion and development: Taking up new challenges in unknown fields
Succeeded in developing an automatic rocket tracking system called the X-Tracker.
Started to take part in space development projects.
Succeeded in developing rocket automatic tracking device
Participation in the space development project began.
We spent two years developing automatic rocket tracking system (the X-tracker), something that was requested by Professor Tsuneyoshi Uemura of Tokyo University, and after many hardships we succeeded in creating a prototype. This X-tracker was able to flawlessly track the rocket immediately after launch, and observers visiting from America praised it highly, saying that it was the most advanced device of anything that they had seen at the Uchinoura test facility. At that time, even was using photographic strip film for orbital tracking of rockets, and the X-tracker was truly an epochal device. It provided the opportunity for us to take part in space development projects such as cameras for observing the aurora borealis and cameras for the "Suisei", the probe tracking Halley's comet.

Tetsu Ishikawa, a lecturer at the Tokyo University Faculty of Medicine, thought that if a device were developed that made it possible to accurately measure pupillary responses (changes in the surface area of the iris) closely related to autonomous nervous system functions, it would be the first such device in the world to be able to do so, and he came to us to see if we could develop it. The development of this "Iriscoder" not only required that we focus everything on improving the product precision, as we had in the past, but also required that we take on a field that was completely unknown to us. That was the field of medical equipment manufacturing, which included camera performance, the convenience of use for physicians, taking the psychological state of the subject into consideration, and other elements with which we were unfamiliar. This device was used to study pupillary responses (adaptation of the eye to darkness and brightness) when entering and driving through tunnels, and the results of those experiments are still at work today in expressway tunnel illumination.
Established an affiliated company in the USA
Preparation for the big leap: Laying the cornerstone for solid-state products and system products.
Developed silicon photodiodes based on the technical expertise we had accumulated through the development and manufacture of electron tubes.
Developed silicon photodiodes based on the technical expertise we had accumulated through the development and manufacture of electron tubes.
Around that time, the camera maker to whom we were supplying Cdcells asked us to develop a silicon photodiode for use with cameras, saying that, as semiconductor components, these photodiodes offered better measurement accuracy and response characteristics than Cdcells. Silicon photodiodes were viewed as very promising at the time as sensors for camera exposure meters and measuring instruments. We got off to a late start in that field, but we drew on the knowhow and the sales channels that we had built up through our electron tube development and manufacturing, and silicon photodiodes later grew to be one of the main products of our Solid State Division.
Established a joint venture company in West Germany (now Germany).
Opening up new borders through connections with computers.
In 1971, microcomputers appeared on the market and their use spread rapidly. We were quick to open up new frontiers in computer-compatible video cameras. The model C1000 (vidicon camera for computers) was an innovative high-precision video camera with the basic performance and functions needed for image processing and measurement. This was quite different from other conventional video cameras that were designed just for “viewing” tasks such as for monitoring and surveillance. The C1000 enabled sophisticated image processing using a computer and its applications were extended to various fields. This combination of video camera and computer is still a feature of our current system products.
space-borne camera we developed helped succeed in capturing aurora images from outer space for the first time in the world.
space-borne camera we developed helped succeed in capturing aurora images from outer space for the first time in the world.
“I’d like to observe auroras from outer space by mounting a camera on an artificial satellite.” We received a request to develop a satellite-borne camera from Prof. Takao Tohmatsu, an authority on geophysics of the Geophysics Research Laboratory, University of Tokyo. In a limited time, we worked to develop a vacuum image storage tube and a camera that would be able to operate reliably for a period of one year under harsh conditions in space such as a vacuum, extremely cold or hot temperatures, and exposure to radiation, as well as having the high durability needed against vibration and shocks applied during the satellite launch. In 1978, the Japanese scientific satellite EXOS-(later named “Kyokko”) equipped with our special camera was launched. After 20 days, when the satellite had traveled around the earth 214 times, it succeeded in capturing 8 beautiful images of an aurora among the 20 images that were taken at that time. This was the first success in the world in capturing aurora images from outer space, and made our company name well-known worldwide in the field of space development.

Our first private exhibition called the Photon Fair was held to introduce and demonstrate our wide-ranging technology and products.
Our first private exhibition called the Photon Fair was held to introduce and demonstrate our wide-ranging technology and products.
Having had a good response from customers visiting our "General Exhibition Osaka" held in 1979 to commemorate the opening of our Osaka sales office, we also held our first overall exhibition called the Photon Fair the next year 1980 in Osaka and Tokyo. The exhibition name Photon Fair was derived from the elementary particle called a photon used in our business slogan “Photon is our business” so as to let more people become familiar with the exhibition. Besides just exhibiting a full range of our products, we also introduced new technologies and made efforts to provide technical consultations, lectures and workshops, so that we could propagate our business philosophy and attitude by way of the Photon Fair. Even now, the Photon Fair is held regularly as an effective place for meeting and talking with customers to exchange ideas and information.

Decided to reorganize the company into business divisions for greater flexibility in meeting business needs of the changing times.
Decided to reorganize the company into business divisions for greater flexibility in meeting business needs of the changing times.
Up to that time, our production department had been managed and controlled as one basic unit. However, since the company’s scale had expanded and the number of product types had increased, we reorganized the company into business divisions to quickly and accurately respond to the changing times and offer more flexible business operations. The company was divided into 3 business divisions: Electron Tube Division, Solid State Division, and Systems Division. The main office and factories of each division had been gathered in an area different from each other, so they have been located there up to today.

Succeeded for the first time in the world in artificial indoor cultivation of rice plants using semiconductor lasers.
This plant factory succeeded in artificially cultivating rice plants in an indoor farm, for the first time in the world using high-power semiconductor lasers instead of sunlight. This experiment relied on semiconductor lasers that were fabricated by applying our technology developed for laser fusion research. Those semiconductor lasers were designed to emit light at 680 nm where the chloroplasts in rice leaves photosynthesize most vigorously. Compared to conventional cultivation methods used in plant factories, this new method applying semiconductor lasers drastically cuts the power cost and shortens the cultivation period, offering the possibility of eliminating global food shortage in the future.

Opened the Graduate School for the Creation of New Industries with the goal of creating new industries.
As we move into the 21st century, remarkable globalization is taking place throughout the world in both industrial and economic sectors. In Japan, which has built the foundation for an economic empire by taking academic learning and technologies introduced from foreign countries and further developing and expanding applications for those technologies, we're now finding that we ourselves need to create new industries, and in turn new cultures, which we can then send out into the rest of the world. The Graduate School for the Creation of New Industries was established by and other enterprises for the purpose of cultivating human resources capable of launching new industries that will focus on light and its infinite possibilities. Put differently, the founding of new industries itself is the foremost objective of education at the University.

20-inch photomultiplier tubes for neutrino observation were certified as an Milestone.
The 20-inch diameter photomultiplier tube we developed for Proton decay experiments at Kamiokande was awarded an Milestone for contributing to neutrinos observation. The Milestone is an award presented by the IEEE, the world’s largest technical professional organization in the electrical, electronic, information, and communication fields. This award recognizes the historical achievement of technical innovations that must have been developed at least 25 years ago and that have contributed to further development of society and industry. The plaque presented as an Milestone award was mounted on a rock and installed as a plaque monument at our Toyooka Factory site. The rock used for the plaque monument is Hida gneiss delivered from the Kamioka mine where these cutting-edge experiments in particle physics are still going on. The plaque monument was placed facing toward the Kamioka mine as if it is watching over the next achievement and awaiting new discoveries.

Principles and organization of our Central Research Laboratory
Life future where the Earth, its people, and all living things coexist in a harmonious balance - aims to make this dream a reality through research into “light” which is the source of all matter.
What will our future be like 20 or 30 years from now? How about a future where all people can enjoy comfortable and active lives with peace of mind and where an optimal balance is maintained among the Earth, its people and all living things? To make this dream a reality we will have to overcome many obstacles and challenges.
Our Central Research Laboratory is conducting R&work that conforms to “sustainability” values. We call this work “Life Photonics” which is based on the theme of “life” encompassing a broad range of areas such as life, living things, human life, vitality sources, and ways of living. We will continue researching a diverse spectrum of and optical technologies taking “Life Photonics” as our motivating theme.
What is light? What can we do with light? Technology development at always starts as a dialogue with light. In this process, our Central Research Laboratory and a number of specialized research facilities play fundamental roles and conduct basic research into light, while pursuing applied research across a diverse range of fields including Optical information processing and measurement, Health and medical care, biotechnology, material science, and energy.
The Central Research Laboratory in City, Shizuoka Pref. is home to a host of specialized research facilities including the Research Center, the Material Center, the Center, the Medical Imaging Center, and the Biotechnology Center. In the Central Research Laboratory, a wide range of research is carried out ranging from basic research which pursues the nature of light to applied research in which the knowledge and technology acquired through basic research is applied in industries.
At our Industrial Development Research Center located in City, we are setting our sights on creating new industries that utilize light for fields including power generation, medical care, and material modification, while working on our core research of “laser fusion” that has the potential to extract energy from hydrogen isotopes in seawater always available in endless quantities.
Tsukuba Research Laboratory in Tsukuba City, Ibaraki Pref. primarily conducts research on bio-in which opto-technology is applied in the field of life science.
Tsukuba Research Center
To achieve the grand dream of “optical computers” as well as an understanding the “complex systems” and “interactions between light and matter,” we have conducted extensive research and created technology for generating and applying so-called new light. We are progressing step by step toward an entirely new type of information processing achieved through research into highly sophisticated light control and measurement on the spatial axis, time axis, and wavelength axis of light.
What can technology do to bring ”true health” to all of us? wide variety of approaches have been continually applied in this field to provide people with a full and healthy life. These include development of systems and applied research, biomedical measurement using near-infrared light, sports-related measurements and even biotechnology-related research. These research approaches also serve to expand the future potential of technology itself.
Biotechnology research is the best possible field for following up on the possibilities offered by technology. We have been doing applied research in this field in a continual search for what can only be revealed by light and in areas where light is of critical importance. This field offers unlimited possibilities for applying technology and we are doing our utmost to propose new technology combining diverse technical areas including light sources and sensors as well as bioassay technology.
In the interaction between light and matter, when the structure of a substance is the same or smaller than the nano-region or in other words the target light wavelength, then that material behaves completely different than it would in the macro region. We refer to this interaction between light and matter and also the interaction between light and electrons in the nano-region as nanophotonics. Our current research in this field focuses on new materials and optical devices that utilize the interaction between this new type of light and matter.
The start of a new industry gives people a new way of life which then creates a new sense of values. The new and true knowledge found from this new sense of values gives birth to new science. To develop new industrial fields, we are setting our sights on creating new industries that utilize light, such as power generation, medical care, and material modification while working on our core research of “laser fusion” that has the potential to extract energy from hydrogen isotopes in seawater available in limitless quantities.

The spirit of pursuing the unknown and unexplored - inherited from our predecessors
started as a small firm established in 1953 by Heihachiro Horiuchi who studied under the guidance of Dr. Kenjiro Takayanagi now respectfully called the “father of Japanese television.” Since then, we have inherited the “photoelectric technology” developed by Dr. Takayanagi for converting light into electrical signals as well as “the spirit of pursuing unknown and unexplored realms” which led him to the achievement of displaying the Japanese character “イ” on a cathode-ray tube for the first time in the world. Over the past 65 years, we have been consistently engaged in developing photoelectric devices and their application products while moving forward along with the continuing advances in technologies of light.
Just as electrons and electronics brought immeasurable richness to our lives in the 20th century, the 21th century will be the age of photons (particles of light) and photonics. Spurred by the unlimited possibilities of light, technology is increasingly applied in a wide range of fields. However, the interaction of light with matter is still hardly understood at the present time. By pursuing the ultimate limits of photoelectric conversion technology to approach the true nature of light, has been challenging the unknown where no one has yet explored, with the aim of creating new industries by utilizing light and acquiring new knowledges.
“Fortune” - the goddess of fortune in Roman myth
To catch the goddess of fortune, one has to get ahead of her and seize her by the forelocks.
Dr. Kenjiro Takayanagi (1899 to 1990)
Dr. Kenjiro Takayanagi - “Father of Japanese television”
Dr. Kenjiro Takayanagi - “Father of Japanese television” Dr. Kenjiro Takayanagi was born in Hamamatsu, Japan in 1899, and graduated from the industrial teacher training school attached to the Tokyo Kuramae Higher Technical School (now Tokyo Institute of Technology). In 1924, he returned to his hometown and took a post as an assistant professor at Industrial High School (now the Faculty of Engineering of Shizuoka University), and at the same time he started research on television technology. Being encouraged by the school philosophy “Freedom and Enlightenment,” Dr. Takayanagi’s research team succeeded for the first time in the world in displaying an image (Japanese character “イ”) on an electronic television screen. This was in 1926, a mere 2 years after he had started his research work.
Heihachiro Horiuchi, the founding president of our company, studied as a student directly under Dr. Takayanagi and was guided by him at Industrial High School. Dr. Takayanagi spoke to his students from time to time saying things like, “What is the purpose of that technology? Will technology prove beneficial to our lives? Make these questions a fundamental part of your research at all times.” He also admonished us not to “learn for learning’s sake” and “research for research’s sake” and always struggled to link the acts of learning and research to value in human life and human society. He never changed this philosophy throughout his whole life.

(The photograph shows a device reproducing the character in the Science Museum.)
Seizing the forelocks of the goddess
As Kenjiro Takayanagi was pursuing his research and was engaged in developing technology that would serve society ten to twenty years in the future, he occasionally had a mental image of the goddess of fortune, and always saw her portrayed as a beautiful woman with full bangs, but no hair at the back of her head. Playing with this idea, Takayanagi imagined that, in order to seize the goddess of fortune, one would have to be one step ahead of her, wait for her to catch up, and then turn around and seize her by the forelocks. Applying this whimsical fancy to his work, Takayanagi resolved to always be one step ahead and have the technology ready when the opportunity to apply it came within reach. carries on this spirit today, constantly striving to be ready and waiting when opportunity arises.
Water is invisible to the fish in a pond.
The fish is swimming without being aware that it is alive thanks to oxygen in air dissolved in water.
We are also living in the unknown and this supreme unknown is light
Heihachiro Horiuchi (1915 to 1997) with a phototube in hand.
Heihachiro Horiuchi, the founder of our company
Being fascinated by the wonders of light since his elementary school days, Heihachiro Horiuchi entered the Electrical Department of Industrial High School (now the Faculty of Engineering of Shizuoka University) where his hero Professor Takayanagi was teaching and was greatly inspired by the professor’s philosophy called Takayanagi-ism. Horiuchi decided to follow this “path of light” by providing society with the means or namely products that would make effective use of light and he worked on developing photoelectric devices that convert light into electrical signals and even now this basic technology still supports our work.
“Pursuing the path of light” (the words spoken by Horiuchi at the 40th anniversary of the founding of our company)
At the time that the words “optical industry” did not even exist, thought of making a living by starting a company to produce and sell photoelectric devices. Some of my seniors were worried and advised me, “Those things are like works of art and won’t make any business profits from the viewpoint of both marketability and yield rate. So should give up on this dream.” However, had heard a story during my elementary school days: “The light from Polaris also called the North Star travels through space for 800 light-years before reaching us on Earth.” Since then, have been totally fascinated by “light” and also attracted to the Professor Takayanagi’s research on television and my thoughts resonated with the spirit of Takayanagi-ism. All of this had already led me to the decision that would go my own way to pursue the path of light even if didn’t have enough food, clothing or shelter, so there was nothing to hold me back from following my dream. Light is the source of our lives and also greatly relates to our mental activities. Nevertheless, light is nearly totally unknown to us. then established the management philosophy underlying a way to understand the nature of light and provide society with a means that allows us to make more use of light.
Instead of being taught by someone, try to see it with your own eyes, listen to it with your own ears, and understand it with your own heart.
What we do not yet know and what we have not yet done are infinite.
Speech at the 24th Conference in 2007
Teruo Hiruma is one of the founding members and the former president of our company. After graduating in 1947 from the Machinery Department of Industrial High School in the old education system (now the Faculty of Engineering of Shizuoka University), he established “Co., Ltd.” along with Heihachiro Horiuchi and Norio Hanyu in 1953. Then, in 1978, Teruo Hiruma became the second president. He strongly pushed toward the challenge of opening up the unknown and unexplored which was taken over from Dr. Takayanagi and Heihachiro Horiuchi, and as a result our company has grown into a worldwide company leading the pack in technology. In 1983, the company name was changed to “K.K.” Then, in 2004, Teruo Hiruma became Chairman and Representative Director of Photonics. Since 2017, he has served as honorary chairman of Photonics.
Photon is our business. First an idea, next a goal, and finally a way.
Today, the application of light is ubiquitous in every field around us. Each field has become a large market and created its own specific industries. We have gained a great deal of knowledge through technology in measuring the ultimate limits of light and its applied research especially in cutting-edge research fields. Based on this knowledge amassed over many years, we are aiming ourselves to create new industries by using technology.
As long as we work in the field of light and photonics, we have an important role to play in pursuing and revealing the possibilities of light in this century. There are lots of things to do.

On December 25, 1926, in the region of Japan, the Japanese katakana “イ” was electronically transmitted and displayed for the first time on a cathode ray tube. To Professor Kenjiro Takayanagi – later called “the father of Japanese television” – this was the moment something entirely new was introduced to the world.
As a result, television technology transformed the lives of people all over the world. It also led to the creation of a company called Photonics, which would focus its research on “photons” or particles of light.
products and technology include optical sensors, light sources, and systems that use these components. They are applied to various new technologies and devices to support people’s lives and help realize a more comfortable and prosperous society. Our products are widely used for state-of-the-art medical equipment, test and inspection systems, microscopes that reveal the functions of cells, and giant telescopes that explore the mysteries of the universe.
We take pride in the fact our technology is a Key Enabling Technology for great things. We are a company that creates original products never before seen in our world.
Our research aims for something not yet achieved. Developing technologies thought to be impossible can sometimes be a grueling experience, but it can also lead to unexpected results. We believe that such efforts bring new value to people and create new industries and prosperity for the world. To carry on the spirit of Professor Kenjiro Takayanagi, we will continue our efforts to build a foundation that makes an essential cornerstone for future technology.
The year 2026 will mark 100 years from the time that the letter “イ” was first displayed on a screen. Keeping this “イ” in mind, we are setting our sights on creating a new “イ” that will again change the world – because that is the kind of company we are at Photonics.
Born in Hamamatsu, Japan, Professor Takayanagi pioneered and demonstrated the technology behind all-electronic television at the Technical High School, now known as the Faculty of Engineering at Shizuoka University.
We research light and utilize our discoveries to develop new products with the aim of challenging unexplored mysteries and create new future industries.Confirmation

Our products are used in a wide range of fields including medical diagnosis, measurement, industrial instrumentation, automobiles, information, general electronics, and academic research. As their product applications expand, demands for even higher product quality and reliability are increasing. To meet these marketplace demands, we are actively taking measures to improve product quality levels.
(The following statement is intended for Electron Tube Division, Solid State Division, System Division and Laser Promotion Division.)
We pursue customer satisfaction and contribution to social and human development with our quality policy.
We continuously improve our quality management system and providing customers
with high quality and safe products and service, we contribute to
the development of society and humankind with optical science and technology.
Status of Quality Management System Certification
After drawing up plans to develop a new product based on market research or requests from customers, we start investigating the possibility of production in terms of product functions, reliability, and costs, etc. Based on results obtained from judging design details, verifying the design from prototypes, trial mass production, and reliability tests, we make sure the design is valid and then authorize the product. We also identify risks and opportunities in the process of design and development and promote product designs with a high degree of perfection.
The production process is supervised based on manufacturing specifications, process charts, and work standards to ensure that quality and reliability are at levels planned in the product design.
To verify that the products meet the required specifications, performs process inspections and product inspections that check the product electrical/mechanical/optical characteristics and external appearance. The inspection items, methods, and test criteria are established in the product specifications. Destructive testing and lot evaluations are done by product sampling inspections.
We make continuous improvements on production processes based on the results from statistical process control and (Key Performance Indicator) monitoring.
The manufacturing history and material lot used for a product that has been shipped are traceable. This enables us to determine a retroactive range at an early stage when a problem occurs.
We use special packing techniques and materials which are also environmentally friendly in order to safeguard product quality and prevent shipping damage.
When a product is authorized or a change is made to a product, we make reliability tests to verify that a product meets the specified reliability requirements. Reliability tests are performed by selecting typical products from among a group of structurally similar products. If needed, this testing is performed individually. Reliability test methods conform to JIS, JEITA, IEC, or standards, and also some products are tested according to customers' requirement.
The work environment in the manufacturing process greatly affects product quality and reliability. Cleanliness, temperature, and humidity in particular must be strictly controlled. Some are produced in clean rooms where cleanliness is maintained at a high level. To maintain and control the cleanliness level in clean rooms, strict control standards are established for factors such as cleanliness, entry/exit methods, work clothing, carry-in items, and work procedures. Also, to maintain and control cleanliness, temperature, and humidity, we established the methods for managing factory equipment.
Damage caused by electro-static discharge (ESD) can be a serious problem as process geometry shrink and diverse packages become available, so electrostatic countermeasures are enforced. The department dealing with products requiring countermeasures sets up special areas that must comply with control standards and gives workers instructions in equipment and work site supervision, work clothing, and handling methods.
When production equipment is implemented and authorized, it is given maintenance and verified for modifications or expansions. Specific methods for making start-up and periodic equipment inspections are established to perform preventive maintenance. Thus quality problems are prevented and stable production is maintained.
Procurement management of parts and materials has a large effect on product quality, so we use a system that judges and then registers both the suppliers and the parts and materials for purchasing.
We carry out an inspection of the suppliers to check compliance with quality environment system, green procurement policy, regulations regarding the chemical substances contained in products, and other factors. We then register those suppliers who meet our standards and also make new and periodic supplier audits mainly by the purchasing, quality control, and design departments. We strive to improve the quality of parts and materials for purchasing by giving proper guidance to the suppliers based on the audit results.
Purchased items undergo strict individual testing and are then registered before they can be used in our products.
An incoming inspection of those purchased items is then made based on the required specifications to verify their quality. After acceptance, these purchased items are stored in properly controlled locations that meet storage conditions specified in the design standards, and a high level of purchased item quality is maintained.
The quality control department periodically calibrates the test and measuring equipment. Calibration equipment is traceable to the national standards through the manufacturers and public organizations. Besides calibration, start-up inspections and periodic inspections are made to prevent and detect a drop in accuracy or a malfunction in the measuring equipment.
When a problem occurs in the production process, which might cause defects that exceed preset process standards or might adversely affect the product quality, then the problematic lot is immediately identified and separated from other semi-finished parts. At the same time, the cause of the problem is investigated, and the corrective action that should be taken is decided. Along with confirming the corrective action was effective, we take measures to prevent the problem from reoccurring.
Changes requiring the customer’s approval in advance are implemented after obtaining the customer’s consent. Initial production control is performed as needed and all effects caused by the change are checked.
Management of chemical substances in products
Environmental regulations, such as RoHS, and China RoHS, have become stricter than ever in worldwide, thereby requiring companies to properly manage the chemicals contained in their products throughout their supply chains.
We have organized a system inside the company in compliance with "Guidelines for the management of chemical substances in products" by JAMP/We make sure to register and use materials complying with the guidelines by implementing green procurement and its survey to our suppliers based on our "Green Procurement Guidelines" and "Green Procurement Management Standard for Chemical Substances". The survey results are stored in centralized information system for chemical substances in products, and used for actions to environmental regulations.
We design products meeting with related standards of and product safety in its development, then make shipments after confirming the conformity with such standards by model testing. For example, we affix marking on regulated products after implementing tests based on the harmonized standards of the target directive.
At Photonics, we work to speedily resolve customer complaints by way of our complaint handling system.
The contents of the complaint are first checked and an investigation made to find the cause. Besides notifying the customer of these results, we also use them as feedback in the design and production processes to prevent a recurrence of the trouble. If we decide, based on those investigation results, that the quality control system must be overhauled, then corrective action is taken and results from that action are verified.
We possess numerous failure analysis systems in the company in order to respond promptly to the needs of in-process defect analysis, complaint analysis and other analysis at any time.
※Our failure analysis systems are available for electron, optical, and acoustic microscopy, surface roughness analysis, atomic analysis, semiconductor failure analysis, and strength test, etc.
We provide worker instruction and training to maintain and improve product quality as well as upgrade employee skills. Employee skills are periodically evaluated, and instruction/training plans are then drawn up and performed as needed. When a particular job requires obtaining qualifications, then those are clearly specified, and a system is then set up to certify employees who meet the requirements of the job.
