Our Approach to Sustainability
As a global corporate citizen, we fulfill our social responsibility, deliver innovative products and services, and create economic, social, and environmental values.
value chain : supply chain, manufacturing, products, customers, innovation
Economic value : maximize profits and shareholder values (product and services innovation).     social value : contribute to a sustainable society (attainment of the SDGs).
Value of sustainability    Economic value : maximize profits and shareholder values (product and services innovation).    social value : contribute to a sustainable society (attainment of the SDGs).
Our endeavors to bring innovative technology and products pave the way to generate profits and secure new growth drivers. We strive to embed innovation into the fabric of our corporate culture while creating synergies through the use of external resources to pursue open innovation. In so doing, we take a step closer to building an ecosystem to develop innovative products that cater to the needs of today’s rapidly-shifting market.
As a global corporate citizen, we at create social values in a way that is aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): Especially, we pinpointed goals that are highly relevant to our business conduct and are analyzing our negative/positive impact in attaining these goals. Furthermore, we will discover and fully explore business opportunities that contribute to reaching the SDGs.
End hunger, Improve food security, and promote sustainable agriculture
Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Ensure quality education and promote life-long learning opportunities for all
Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all
Reduce inequality within and among countries
Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, reilient, and sustainable
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns
Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
Protect and sustainably use the oceans, seas, and marine resources
Protect the ecosystem and preserve blodiversity (forests, deserts, land, etc.)
Strengthen the means of implementation and revitailze the global partnership for sustainable development
* Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) : In September 2015, the General Assembly adopted sustainable development goals in order to achieve social sustainability across the globe. Building on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were focused on less-development countries, the SDGs set universal goals that should be met by all countries including advanced ones, and thus demand full engagement of civil society and businesses in the private sector as well as governments and experts in attaining these goals.
At Samsung, we strive to create social and environmental values as well as economic values through our sustainability management so as to contribute to the betterment of the global society. Since such social and environmental values are difficult to quantify, we took a ‘quality over quantity’ approach in setting and managing our sustainability management goals. Since 2016, however, we have adopted the ‘True Value’ method of that quantifies social and environmental indicators so that we can visualize the values that we create.
The positive (+) and negative (-) numbers of respective indicators represent the total social values that we either created or reduced over the past year by December 31st of 2016. This approach enables us to go beyond mere financial values generated through business conduct and include socio-economic and social values to ultimately paint the whole picture of the True Value that we create at Samsung.
