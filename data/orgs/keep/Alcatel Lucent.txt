Thomas Holt is adopting industry-leading technology to gain a competitive advantage in the aged care market and offer superior quality service to its residents.
Thomas Holt is a community not-for-profit organization providing care and choice for older Australians. The organization offers residential living, retirement living, as well as home care services. As part of its mission, Thomas Holt is adopting and integrating new technology to build a leading-edge experience for clients and staff.
We believe that our customers deserve the best technology and therefore we wanted to partner with only the very best technology providers out there. When it comes to the intersection of industry knowledge and technology, there is no better than ALE.
Thomas Holt is facing competition from industry-disrupting companies who offer at-home services, like food delivery and entertainment. As such the aged care provider is entering a new realm of hyper-connectivity that enables residents to have the same technology experience they would have at home, coupled with professional medical and aged care.
To meet the challenge head on, Thomas Holt placed technology at the heart of its strategy to gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace. The organization was looking for a forward-thinking partner to build an industry-leading technology ecosystem.
The OpenTouch Notification Service facilitates the integration of key systems like nurse call systems, entertainment systems, meal ordering system, and the clinical management system.
The critical infrastructure provided by ALE, including WiFi, and the OmniEnterprise Communication Server, enables Thomas Holt to innovate and continually improve services for clients and staff.
Thomas Holt is becoming a leader by offering non-intrusive and ambient care in a ground-breaking way for the Aged Care Industry.
The technology improvements reduce administration and allow the nurses to spend more time caring for residents.
Mobility is critical to Thomas Holt’s service delivery. The solution gives nurses access to critical client information wherever they are. 
Live Care 360° lets residents and carers access the information available to nurses at Thomas Holt facilities and vice versa, improving service quality for in-home care. The platform also enhances productivity by digitizing performance management and reducing administrative tasks for carers. This permits staff to focus on delivering quality care and supports them in making better clinical decisions.
This case study describes how Thomas Holt adopted industry-leading technology to gain a competitive advantage in the aged care market and improve services.

 develop technical and sales alliance to address evolving video surveillance market
Demand for video surveillance and connected safety in hospitality, casino, arena, cities, and healthcare environments drive increase in technology requirements
Alcatel-Enterprise and BCDVideo, a leading provider of innovative, purpose-built video storage solutions, today announced they are working together to address the growing demand of businesses to enhance public security and safety via video surveillance and networking. 
Advances in Video surveillance are helping cities, hospitals, hotels, sporting and entertainment venues focus on improving public safety, deterring crime and helping police solve crimes, and providing first responders with situational awareness during emergencies. These enterprises recognize accessing video surveillance systems, files, analytics and applications requires a stable network with reduced network downtime and increased network reliability.
The two companies are aligning to offer customers and integrators best in breed technology via a simplified infrastructure and an award-winning surveillance system. Leveraging Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) technology offered on the Alcatel-
, the joint offer creates a highly available network that exceeds speed and management requirements to support the massive data transfer and file volume of a surveillance system. ALE’s unique offering in the surveillance market delivers built-in, easy provisioning and integration of surveillance equipment for more flexibility, while reducing the cost of implementing and maintaining the network.
Video surveillance networks often suffer high latency issues from legacy switching solutions. reduces the latency time to deliver data packets and enables high network availability for maximum use of all physical connections and routed services resulting in greater network stability. and BCDVideo worked closely to ensure each piece of the solution was tested for high availability leveraging technology. Businesses and integrators gain a resilient surveillance network with a simplified infrastructure, which optimizes the surveillance system performance and results.

– “Improper network configurations are the root of most technical issues with surveillance systems. As technology advances, BCDVideo recognizes video content is only as good as the ability for the viewer to attain access to the files over the network. It has become imperative for various government bodies and business owners to deploy video surveillance systems to effectively monitor and record activities within and around the premises. Aligning our systems to build a best of breed network with a switch vendor like Alcatel-Enterprise, enables us to jointly deliver a highly reliable system to customers in a range of specialized environments.”
– “Surveillance solutions have changed immensely over the last decade and, in many ways, networking for these solutions has not changed with them. Many businesses are now recognizing the need to upgrade their underlying network to achieve the performance needed to utilize their surveillance solution appropriately. This new joint offering from and BCDVideo transcends what surveillance networks were capable of in the past by taking our companies’ two most reliable solutions and providing reliability and optimization that neither can deliver alone. Our OmniSwitch core and edge switches are optimized to move traffic over and provide critical connectivity between servers and network devices.”
BCDVideo’s focus on proactive response and personal service has allowed us to become the most trusted source for security integrators to find innovative, purpose-built video storage solutions.

The solution was designed with simplicity in mind. Only a small team is required for network management and maintenance.
Tenants benefit from excellent connectivity and a consistent experience throughout Kreativ House.
Visitors enjoy secure access thanks to the easily configured OmniVista guest application.

Okada Manila Resort hotel wanted a converged network solution to improve guest experience and handle the devices of up to 20,000 guests at any time.
The Okada Manila Resort Hotel is the Philippine’s largest integrated resort located on the Entertainment City gaming strip in Parañaque. It is home to nearly 1000 rooms, 500 gaming tables and 3000 slot machines, 80,000 square meters of retail space, and the world's biggest multicolor dancing water fountain. 
We hope to work with the team going forward to expand the Okada Manila and make it the best integrated resort in Asia Pacific. 
With up to 20,000 guests entering Okada Manila during peak hours, the resort needed a resilient, reliable, and secure network infrastructure to handle the volume of data and devices connecting at any given moment.
The resort’s network infrastructure is critical to providing an outstanding service and visitor experience onsite. Guests must be able to connect their devices seamlessly to access personal or business data, while being assured of their personal and transaction security. 
ALE’s proprietary solution allows Okada Manila to monitor, control and manage the entire network.
The solution provides redundancy and resiliency at all levels of the network, ensuring critical network connectivity in the gaming area, hotel, and retail spaces.
The network is scalable and can support the resort’s future development.  
Okada Manila plans to utilize the new network to further improve the guest experience and double the resort’s daily footfall.
ALE’s solution facilitates moving machines with minimal interruptions, keeping them online and available for guests.
The network denies peer-to-peer communications and keeps guest transactions secure by routing all data through a secure server. 
The converged solution enables innovation in the guest experience by facilitating onboarding of new devices and new features, as well as the integration of different platforms.

Blickle and Scherer needed a cloud-based solution that would support collaboration while maintaining strict safety and data protection standards.
Blickle and Scherer provides reliable private mobile radio communications to public authorities, transport companies, energy suppliers, as well as renowned industrial enterprises and service providers. It has its headquarters in Karlsruhe and five additional locations in Southern Germany.
Rainbow means a considerable workload reduction in everyday life. Before, communication between sites was limited to phone calls and sending documents via e-mail. Today, multisite teams work together on sales or presentations, using video calls and instant messaging in addition to the telephone.
Blickle & Scherer wanted to provide employees with modern Unified Communications (UC) platform functions, such as presence information, instant messaging, image sharing, document sharing, and collaborative working on sales offers and presentations. The objective was to improve communications and collaboration between the company’s six sites.
Since Blickle & Scherer work primarily with public authorities responsible for public safety and emergency services, its employees must undergo strict security checks by the Ministry of the Interior of the federal state of Baden-Württemberg. For security reasons, and to comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the use of consumer instant messaging and Voservices is prohibited. The company needed a solution that would support collaboration while maintaining these strict safety and data protection standards.
Lastly, the solution needed to be cloud-based as there was no staff available to support implementation onsite.
Through Blickle Leitstellen&Kommunikationstechnik, Blickle & Scherer supports Germany’s Public Safety Digital Radio, a critical channel for maintaining communications between emergency services’ mission control centers, command vehicles and emergency personnel onsite. The solution helps that the emergency workers are available 24/7 and offers a notification system to inform and guide rescue forces.
The Connect converged communication platform leverages analog and digital connectivity across sites to facilitate communications and productivity. 
Cloud-based Rainbow delivers all desired collaboration functionalities, while maintaining the strictest GDPR-compliant standards of security and data protection.
Blickle & Scherer uses the free Rainbow Essential in combination with the licensed-based Rainbow Enterprise to generate savings while keeping all employees connected.
The monthly licensing model is cost effective for and avoids expensive investments.
Rainbow is as simple to use as any consumer messaging app, helping staff adopt the technology and use collaborative functions to simplify teamwork.
Thanks to Rainbow, employees communicate more efficiently across sites, as well as when they travel or work from home. Blickle & Scherer is also looking to extend the use of Rainbow to communicate with its customers.
