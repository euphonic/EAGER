Corporate Compliance Program
"At Zoetis, compliance starts from the top and cascades at every level of the organization.  Compliance is fundamental to the health of our organization." 
-Juan Ramón Alaix, CEO
Our comprehensive corporate compliance program is designed to ensure that all colleagues not only meet legal requirements in the markets in which we operate, but also act responsibly and with integrity in everything they do.  combination of written guidelines, formal processes and management oversight helps us ensure that colleagues comply with laws and the ethical standards reflected in the Code of Conduct.  Our Compliance Program incorporates the following key elements.
1.  Written Policies and Procedures
At Zoetis, colleagues receive a Code of Conduct that defines the expectation of behavior and practices which are both acceptable and unacceptable to the Company.  Serving as a resource guide for colleagues, it outlines the Company’s overall commitment to ethical business practices and legal requirements. View the Code of Conduct .
On February 12, 2018, amendments to the Code of Conduct became effective. The updated Code has been revised and reformatted to generally enhance its clarity and accessibility. With respect to the provisions of the Code addressing matters required to be included in a “code of ethics” under relevant and regulations, certain textual edits were made to these provisions but we consider them to be of a non-substantive nature. The revised Code can be accessed using the link above.
2.  Chief Compliance Officer and Executive Compliance and Risk Council
Kate Walden serves as Zoetis' Chief Compliance Officer and is responsible for overseeing the Company's Corporate Compliance Program, which includes training, monitoring systems, developing informational resources, and investigating potential violations of law or Company policy.

The is chaired by the and made up of senior leaders from across the Company. 
Ms. Walden can be reached at Katherine.H.Walden@zoetis.com.
3.  Effective Training and Education
One of the cornerstones of an effective compliance program is education and training.  is committed to providing effective training to all employees, officers, and directors on the Compliance Program. Colleagues participate in live and online compliance education, and also have access to an intranet site, which contains the Company’s policies, including the Code of Conduct, and other information and resources regarding compliance.  In some cases, colleagues may be required to complete annual compliance training and additional specific training in risk areas as warranted.
4.  Effective Lines of Communication

One Health Approach
The "One Health" Advantages Delivers
We recognize that the health of animals and people are interconnected. Research and development in veterinary medicine can help inform and even accelerate innovation in human medicine. Likewise, insights in human medicine can inform innovation in animal health. We call this interdependence One Health.
Taking a One Health approach holds the promise of mutual gains. Bioinformatics and biomarker development for diseases transcend species, uniting the biology of disease understanding across the animal kingdom. Solutions for newly emerging infectious diseases in animals may help protect the health of people.
People and animals have a number of diseases in common such as osteoarthritis, kidney disease, and allergic dermatitis and both experience pain and inflammation as manifestations of underlying diseases. Collaboration between human and animal health researchers provides the potential to advance the understanding of mutually relevant diseases and expand the translational approach to medicine.
More than 60 percent of infectious diseases that can affect people are zoonotic, meaning they can transmit between animals and people. Approaches to control infectious disease in animals, especially livestock, are becoming increasingly important.
Similarly, technologies that target control of infectious diseases, or that support the prediction or enhancement of feed efficiency in livestock, would be highly valuable to the animal health industry.

No company, large or small, can succeed alone in the world of breakthrough medicines and vaccines. is increasingly recognized as the animal health partner of choice for powerful research and development partnerships that combine complementary talents, expertise and passion with the organizational capacity to deliver innovative products that improve the care of animals globally.
We enrich our broad internal R&capabilities with alliances that help foster creativity, facilitate risk sharing and advance innovative science. We have joined forces in approximately 100 research alliances with partners throughout the animal health, pharmaceutical, biotechnology and agribusiness industries and collaborate with current and emerging leaders in academia, and public and private institutions that are focused on improving the health and well-being of animals and the people who care for them.
has established research collaboration agreements with biotech companies such as 
Stabilitech
 that are pioneering new technologies. Other research collaborations of interest include:
BacVactory Collaboration for Bacterial Vaccine Development
is participating with a multidisciplinary team of public and private partners from animal and human health in the 
Bac Vactory research collaboration
.  This five year program, begun in May 2017, will examine bacteria that are closely related and cause diseases in humans and animals, in order to develop innovative, safe and efficacious vaccines. Collaboration among scientists in veterinary and human health in a true ‘One Health’ approach and across academic institutions and the life sciences industry offers opportunities for and its research partners to bring innovative vaccines for animals and people to market faster. 
The alliance is part of a broader emphasis in research and development at on solutions to prevent disease and, in turn, reduce the incidence of infectious disease and the need to treat it with anti-infective medicines.  
STAR-Global Research Network
is the founding industry member of this global research network that brings together research organizations, the pharmaceutical industry and international animal health bodies to make significant progress in infectious disease research and bring about targeted and tangible control methods.
Easter Bush Research Consortium
Our research collaboration with the largest veterinary research consortium in Europe is aimed at finding better ways to prevent and manage disease, and to advance sustainable animal agriculture and welfare in Europe.
Research Collaboration
is the sole animal health company participant in PROHEALTH, a consortium of 22 research partners from 11 European countries coordinated by Newcastle University. In 2013, was awarded the largest grant ever given by the European Union in the Animal Health field (€11.9 million) to explore ways to increase disease prevention and production quality in swine and poultry farming while limiting environmental impact and preserving profitability for farmers.
