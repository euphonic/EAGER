For millions of people around the world, has become synonymous with adventure and passion, in both work and play.
For more than 60 years, we've been making high-quality, breakthrough products—whether it's launching the snowmobile industry, reinventing categories year after year, developing the first purpose-built military vehicles or introducing a radical 3-wheel moto-roadster.
From our entrepreneurial roots as a mechanical shop, we've grown into one of the world's largest Powersports companies. And in recent years, we've expanded beyond Powersports into adjacent markets, like commercial and military vehicles, where we can add value. Today, offers a diverse portfolio of best-in-class brands.
Our vision is to fuel the passion of riders, workers and outdoors enthusiasts around the world by delivering innovative, high-quality vehicles, products, services and experiences that enrich their lives.
For purposes of shareholder reporting, we are organized into four businesses:
The spirit can be traced back to co-founders Edgar Hetteen, his younger brother Allan and his close friend David Johnson. The hard-working trio started the forerunner of Polaris—Hetteen Hoist & Derrick—in 1945 in tiny Roseau, Minnesota. With World War raging and metal scarce, their skill at repairing farm machinery quickly earned them loyal customers.
But it was their tinkering with a better way to get remote hunting shacks in deep snow that earned them a place in history: Our co-founders developed an early snowmobile in 1955. To prove the vehicles weren't just frivolous toys, Edgar and three friends embarked on a 1,200-mile journey across the Alaskan wilderness to demonstrate the vehicle's durability. They lugged 900 pounds of provisions on toboggans and endured minus-40 degree temperatures to complete the journey in 21 days.
Their determination paid off. The machines became so popular that began manufacturing 
 exclusively, which we did for many years before launching into additional product lines that leveraged our strengths in product development, powertrain, manufacturing, distribution and marketing.
Since adding All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs) in 1984, we've grown to become a global Powersports leader, providing some of the best-selling brands in the industry, including

 Factory Racing Sweeps First Place at World Finals
 – Snow bikers now have more choices of industry-leading Timbersled
 snow bike systems with the introduction of the new Timbersled
 120 with 12% more flotation.
The Timbersled 120 is widely recognized as the ultimate do-everything snow bike, and the new Timbersled 129 shares many of its features – with a new rail and 129 hyfax, new extended side panels, and a new 129 Traverse Track that is instrumental in the system’s 12% greater flotation.
The Timbersled family offers riders a full line of snow bike systems, with an kit that’s just right for each type of rider. Along with the Timbersled 120 and the new Timbersled 129 LE, there’s the Timbersled 137 for the deepest snow and steepest climbs.
Each Timbersled system features a durable, proven, state of the art platform design, that delivers a true bolt-on design making them the easiest to install and convert. They provide the best handling on- and off-trail, giving riders the ultimate deep snow agility and climbing capabilities along with confidence-inspiring trail handling and cornering.
Key elements of the systems that make them the industry’s best-handling snow bikes include:
1:1 ski-to-track ratio for the most precise cornering and best side-hilling control.
Direct Bolt-On System with no required bike modifications
The Traverse Track for improved trail handling and deep snow lift
High strength aluminum frame to make it Timbersled Tough
The Rear Suspension features an advanced design that mimics the feel of a dirt bike with a track approach angle optimized to improve lift in deep snow. It delivers 30% more front track shock travel and 2” more overall suspension travel than the previous Timbersled
 chassis. The exclusive shielded brake system reduces ice buildup and provides improved, consistent on-snow performance.
The system is the easiest to convert because it’s a direct bolt-on system with no bike modifications required. With the bolt-on spindle there’s no need to drill, the brakes are pre-bled, and there’s no air box modification required. Once installed, the direct bolt-on suspension is easy to tune to suit a rider’s preferences.
The new Timbersled 129 has a new 129” Traverse Track, new longer rails and hyfax, new extended side panels, and a new extended tunnel top that offers expanded cargo space. The new 129 comes in Titanium Matte Metallic and has color-matched features including the bumper, frame standoffs, graphics, rails, suspension arms, QS3 shocks, white ski hoop, and spindle.
The 129 also has the Timbersled Traverse Ski 2.0, which has an aggressive tri-keel shape and ski skags for improved strength, grip, and precise handling. This ski provides better lean angles on hard pack and greater control in deep snow.
Timbersled models have proven their durability in the fiercest competition and in the toughest terrain. Timbersled snow bike systems are the #1 choice of regional and Games champions because of their proven durability.

Community Collaboration Transforms Trails and Ride Practices in New Hampshire
 – Six local organizations are linking arms for the first time to bring change to the North Country trail system, Ride the Wilds, while raising industry standards for motorsport riding nationally. Funding the project, The Foundation has given the newly formed alliance a $100,000 grant, which will go toward the creation and installation of 1,000 new trail signs that will provide directional guidance and promote safe and responsible riding practices throughout the trail system.
“Ride the Wilds is an iconic trail system that provides thousands of miles of trails where riders can create memories, discover adventures and spend time with friends and family,” said Lucy Clark Dougherty, president of the Foundation. “is honored to support this community’s collaborative effort to enhance off-road riding experiences.”
Working together to improve community relations by showcasing a strong collaboration between township, clubs, landowners and state entities, organizations included in the alliance are 
The North Country Chamber of Commerce
. With a focus on improving overall rider education, safety and experience through better signage, expected completion is May 2019.
“The new initiative will improve navigation, decrease improper access and enhance the overall quality of the trail system,” said Corrine Rober, owner of 
 Certified Outfitter, Bear Rock Adventures and marketing chair for North Country Chamber of Commerce. “Bear Rock is on the front lines when it comes to customer feedback, and one of the most consistent recommendations from our guests is to improve trail signage. With tourism growing in our community, it’s our job to provide these improvements and ongoing education so locals and tourists alike can properly utilize our trails.”
According to New Hampshire’s Office of Strategic Initiatives, data shows tourism is a driving factor of economic growth in Coos County. Largely due to off-roading, Ride the Wilds has been the only economic initiative in the county since 2013. From 2012 to 2017, spending on lodging and meals increased 34 percent annually, which rose to 37 percent during months when off-road trails were open. This added spending helps support local economies through jobs and the generation of additional tax revenue.
In addition to promoting tourism, the alliance has been in direct collaboration with Chris Gamache, the head of the Bureau of Trails for the state, to ensure the signage is also helping reach larger bureau initiatives throughout the trail system.
“The project to improve trail signage, which is one of the most significant areas of improvement needed on the trails, is a tremendously positive initiative, and we look forward to working on these improvements with the local clubs and chambers," said Gamache, chief of the New Hampshire Bureau of Trails.
Communities benefitting from the new signage include Clarksville, N.H.; Colebrook, N.H.; Columbia, N.H.; Dixville Notch, N.H.; Errol, N.H.; Millsfield, N.H.; Pittsburg, N.H.; West Stewartstown, N.H.; Averill, Vt.; Beecher Falls, Vt.; Canaan, Vt.; and Lemington, Vt.
The North Country Chamber of Commerce strives to serve its members by way of business advocacy, promotion of regional attractions and involvement in initiatives to foster economic growth. It promotes northern Coos County, New Hampshire and northeastern Essex County, Vermont. Visitor information and brochures about the area can be found in the State Rest Area and Community Interpretive Center three minutes north of the Chamber on Route 3. The visitor center is open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. seven days a week.
