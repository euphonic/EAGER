The system also enables high throughput as a solution for high volume manufacturing (HVM), in comparison with the solutions on the market today. Unity_LIGHTi solution can also support the control of manufacturing processes at OSATs, foundry, and IDMs.
Detecting shorts and opens on and residues on bump top and bond-pads that lead to field failures remains a major challenge or device makers today. The Unity_LIGHTisystem leverages expertise from recent acquisitions that are now fully integrated into Unityto secure the best process control for the environment. The system can be configured to inspect wafers up to 300mm, including thin wafers, reconstructed wafers, and wafers mounted on dicing frames.
The combination of line-scan technologies and confocal chromatic techniques allows for 2and 3inspection for the front side of the wafer and 2for backside and edge. With newly designed illumination optics and proprietary defect classification algorithms, Unity_LIGHTisystem eliminates false defects generated from the metal grains on and bumps and enhances the defect detection of true defects of interest.
“We are proud at Unityto announce the release of the newly designed process control solution and our leadership in this market segment. This new product will contribute significantly to position Unityas the market leader of customer-oriented solutions for the advanced packaging arena and a partner to secure challenging manufacturing processes” said of Kamel Ait-Mahiout.

Time-domain Optical Coherence is the most robust solution for depth, bow & warp and individual layer of a stack measurement as each interface is detected in the right order over a larger range than spectral interferometry. The only limitation is the minimum measurable thickness due to the high coherence length of the source.
new Near-Infrared Interferometer was recently developed at Laboratories. The spectral bandwidth was increased to 110 nm, i.e. the minimum detectable optical thickness was improved by a factor of nearly three. This technology has been implemented into the T-series.
The 300 has been qualified by a major customer for process control performed prior to 3hybrid bonding process used in (Back Side Imager) manufacturing. The tool is able to measure nanoscale topography at die level and at the extreme edge of the wafer with high lateral resolution and from several hundred of nm to few nm level of amplitude. Mechanical profilometry comparisons have shown good potential to perform measurement on wafers without metal layer coating.  This represents a key advantage for inline control, as the technology will allow higher throughput than mechanical profilometry and the ability to give much more information to tune and control the process.
