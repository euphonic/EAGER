We will contribute to the sustainable advancement of society by achieving growth as One Global and aim to be the world’s no. 1 position
Our aim is to achieve sustainable growth by becoming a trusted partner of our customers around the world
In 2017, following the increase in sales mainly from higher demands in automotive and industrial products, the completion of the purchase of Intersil in February 2017, the dissipation of the impact from the Kumamoto earthquake in 2016, and as a result of unified efforts to implement the Reform Plan, the Group achieved a double-digit operating margin, bringing the establishment of a stable financial base clearly into view.
The Group will continue to implement efforts of the following themes: “Expanding and Strengthening of Business Portfolio to Accelerate the Leap from Structural Reforms of the Growth Stage” and “Continuous Optimization of the Manufacturing Structure”.
In order to win deeper trust, is determined to reinforce and revitalize our human resources, as well as to focus our resources on our strategic segments and provide solutions that will increase value for our customers. By becoming trusted partners with our customers, we are confident that will also be able to generate stable profits and achieve sustainable growth.
We will contribute to the realization of a sustainable society by creating leading semiconductor solutions
In recent years, we have experienced global warming, localized heavy rainstorms, large droughts and other abnormal weather, together with issues on a global scale such as problems of water resources and energy that have become matters of international concern. The expanding disparity between rich and poor, the problem of conflict minerals, human rights issues and other such issues that can only be addressed by society as a whole, have grown to an overwhelming magnitude. In order to resolve issues like these and welcome a future of prosperity, is committed to contribute to the realization of a sustainable society by creating leading semiconductor solutions. We will do this by providing semiconductor products that take into careful consideration their impact on the global environment, from design through to disposal, so that our customers can use our products with a sense of security. We will also work to make semiconductor products that consume less power and enable highly precise energy control functionality by means of our semiconductors, so as to contribute to the heightened energy-saving performance of our customers’ equipment. We are also committed to continuing consideration of the problems of human rights, the environment and conflict minerals.
Our work on developing and fostering human resources heightens their value and our corporate value as well
Going forward, the key to returning to the growth track and heightening the corporate value of is developing and fostering human resources. As we see it, a vibrantly energetic workplace and employees who can work autonomously are also important components.
In addition to continuing our efforts to foster human resources through employee education and other measures, introduced a new personnel evaluation system in 2014 for the purpose of raising employee motivation and promoting their ability to work autonomously. Moreover, we established the “Organization Development Unit” in 2016, targeting a more efficient business operation and a highly flexible and integrated organization, on top of human resource development. Our aim for the future under this new evaluation system is to create a society and a workplace that enables every individual employee to work autonomously with a high degree of motivation and to display their creative abilities.
As good corporate citizens, we will work to increase our contributions to society with the aim of achieving harmonious coexistence with the local community
Our goal at is to become a corporate citizen that is a familiar, friendly presence for the residents of the local communities in which we operate. It is important, therefore, that also accurately grasps the needs of the local community members and provides a solid response.
The Group is engaging in social contribution programs in different regions throughout the world. Looking to the future, we aim to continue serving as a good corporate citizen, to listen to what the residents of the local communities are saying, to become a company that is viewed warmly by local communities, and to coexist in harmony with them.

Smart meters enable an advance toward a next-generation ecology in which power, gas, and water meters are linked via networks. Renesas' measurement and communication technology with ultra-low-power technology raise smart meters to a new level.
Smart meters for power, gas, and water are spreading worldwide. Smart meters have two-way communication, which enable to track utility usage in real time by both the utility supplier and the consumer, and also enable  start / reading / cutoff of supply remotely by supplier. Implementation of a Home Energy Management System (HEMS) or Building Energy Management System (BEMS) that enables visualization of the power usage in individual homes or in entire buildings is also possible.
Further advances can be anticipated that will make the entire power grid smarter. Smarter power grids capable of dynamically optimizing supply will be essential once power grids begin to supply large amounts of electricity from renewable energy sources such as solar power.
The Burgeoning Market for Smart Meters
In Japan, following the April 2014 revision of the Act on Rationalization of Energy Use, 10 major power companies decided to introduce smart meters. Tokyo Electric Power Company plans to complete the transition to smart meters within its service area by 2020, and a similar transition is expected to be completed nationwide by 2024. In the United States more than 55 million smart power meters are already in use, accounting for more than 40% of households. In the the European Parliament issued a directive (Directive 2009/72/EC) in 2009 encouraging a transition to smart power meters and directing member nations to prepare a legal framework for the introduction of smart meters. Already both Sweden and Italy have reached nearly 100% adoption of smart meters. In addition to the advanced economies, interest in smart meters is high in emerging economies, with more and more countries planning adoption.

offers a multitude of microcontrollers combining low power consumption and excellent reliability as solutions for gas and water meters
Gas meters must measure and display the amount of gas used, and in Japan they must also provide safety functions to automatically detect abnormal states and cut off the gas supply. This means that the microcontrollers used in gas meters require the ability to connect to sensors of various types.
The Japanese Measurement Law stipulates replacement limits of 10 years for gas meters and eight years from water meters, and the batteries incorporated into these meters must have operational lifetimes of at least this duration. These applications therefore require microcontrollers with ultra-low current consumption.
The RL78/L1x Series and RL78/G1x Series offer such ultra-low current consumption while providing improved fail-safe functions such as a high-safety watchdog timer (WDT) and an on-chip oscillation circuit that is highly resistant to oscillation errors. In addition, a broad lineup of package options enables customers to select a microcontroller with precisely the right functions and size for the gas meter or water meter they are developing.
The RL78/I1features enhanced analog functions such as op-amp, 12-bit A/converter, and window converter; low current consumption of 124 μwhen operating at 1 MHz; and a medium-speed oscillator with a fast wakeup time of 4 μsec. solution is available for measuring the flow measurement unit rotation rate in gas or water meters employing the RL78/I1D.

Communication links bring new value. Renesas’ technological expertise can help reduce development time while enabling highly sophisticated smart meters.
The biggest feature of smart meters is their communication functionality. This functionality links the power supplier (the power company) and the consumer (the device in the home), and a variety of communication standards are used in different countries and regions.
In Japan, wireless multi-hop, 1:wireless, and are being considered for communication between the supplier and smart meter. For communication within the home (or building), Wi-wireless communication, supplemented by power line communication (PLC), are the main methods employed.
In the and Europe, Wi-and hold the dominant positions, while a variety of other methods such as wireless multi-hop, 2or 3mobile communication, and ZigBee® wireless communication are under consideration.
