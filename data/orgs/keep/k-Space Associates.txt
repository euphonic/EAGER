 Take a Tour of What We Do
For industrial applications, is known for its ability to provide robust data and analysis for in-line solutions in production environments. works side by side with the customer to understand their specific needs, and then develops a custom solution to meet measurement requirements. This includes technology, software, data analysis, customization, automation of measurements, and integration with existing systems.
For the thin-film, semiconductor and photovoltaic (PV) industries, metrology tools focus on real-time data acquisition, processing, and analysis of nearly all deposition parameters of importance. These parameters include wafer and film temperature, thin-film stress and strain, wafer curvature, bow and tilt, surface roughness and quality, film thickness and deposition rate, optical band gap and atomic spacing. We also supply 
ex situ
 wafer and surface analysis tools that perform full curvature, stress, and wafer bow mapping on up to 300mm wafers.
Our tools are used in today’s most advanced thin-film deposition and processing applications within compound semiconductor, silicon semiconductor and photovoltaic advanced thin film production and R&D.  Sophisticated software analysis and reporting capabilities provide information to better understand tomorrow’s electronic and optoelectronic devices, or to provide online control during mass production to enhance yield. Tailored optics and fully integrated solutions have been designed for simple mounting and non-invasive monitoring of advanced deposition processes such as: MOCVD, MBE, sputtering, thermal and e-beam evaporation, and PLD.
