Industrial Power Control products are crucial for generating and transmitting electric power efficiently and with virtually no losses – as well as for reducing energy consumption. Our leading market position is based on technological leadership and on being an innovative, reliable partner for our customers.
Power semiconductors are often the determining factor, not only in terms of function, but also when it comes to the efficiency, size, weight and cost of our customers’ products and systems. Our many years of industrial experience and innovative strength help us develop the right components for the relevant applications.
We shape Power Management – we live Energy Efficiency
The number of electronic devices we use in our everyday lives is constantly growing. The significance of the power supply for these devices is not always obvious, yet it is crucial for their reliability, power consumption and size.
Efficiency, powerful batteries and chargers, and high effectiveness: These customer requirements place new demands on the efficiency and size of our power supply solutions. The power density thus becomes a decisive factor. Our concepts for “Digital Power Management” – the transition from analog to digital control of the power supply – address this trend directly. With technology that achieves more, consumes less and is accessible to everyone.

OKWe do what we promise. That´s quality made by Infineon.
What does quality mean to us?
products are part of our everyday life: the trains we board are moved by highly energy-efficient drives powered by our modules. Our sensors, microcontrollers and security solutions make the vision of automated driving a reality. Today, radar systems already support the driver for instance by recognizing objects or persons in the road. An emergency brake can be activated automatically, preventing a collision.
Our products make life easier, safer and greener. In some applications they even help save lives. That is why there is no compromise when it comes to quality.
Our customers can rely on us: We do what we promise. That’s quality made by Infineon.
Quality at a glance
Quality is not something you add – it has to be built-in
Quality is a decisive competitive advantage. For this reason, quality is an integral part of the whole product lifecycle from development and production to delivery and associated product services.
It takes up to 1,200 manufacturing steps to go from the silicon wafer to the chip. Complex chemical and physical methods are employed in a highly automated production environment . On many of our products, conducting paths are microscopically small; a single dust particle could cause the chip to fail. That is why our wafers are processed in cleanrooms equipped with cutting-edge machinery and controlled by highly-skilled employees. The manufacturing process is subject to permanent electronic monitoring in order to ensure stability and achieve the goal of “zero defect”.
We live quality in our daily work – in our cleanrooms, our labs and our offices
The mindset working towards “zero defect” is firmly established within the whole organization. Dedicated quality principles give additional guidance to our employees. The overarching aspiration of these principles is to always keep our commitments: it is our highest priority to deliver in compliance with the agreed functionality, reliability, time, volume and cost. Here the first prerequisite is to truly understand the customer and clearly define the requirements a product has to fulfill.
Keeping commitments is also a value that characterizes our internal collaboration. We continuously keep the awareness of quality on a high level with “Quality Days” at our sites around the globe.
All employees act as quality advocates in their respective areas of responsibility.
They are sensitive to deviations and are encouraged to always detect the underlying root cause in order to find a sustainable solution.
Well-established processes, methods and tools together with continuous improvement programs complete the basis for the outstanding position of quality at Infineon. We follow the principle of cross-linking the quality functions in our global matrix organization. By doing so, we make sure that we have a dedicated quality interface in place wherever it helps us come even closer to “zero defect”.
Quality along the product lifecycle
Trend analysis
Our society is in a state of constant change. New challenges and requirements emerge, changing our markets. We always keep an eye on these developments. Based on out observations, together with our customers we determine which products are needed in order to offer safe and green solutions that are successful in the market.
Then we define the requirements a new product has to fulfill. The decisive factor here is the system in which our customer will use a chip from Infineon. For example, applications in a car call for properties quite different from those needed in a smartphone. Our design engineers then translate these requirements into a theoretical chip construction. This step already takes subsequent manufacturing techniques into account.
Now questions with a decisive bearing on realization are answered: What technology is best suited? How can we guarantee the necessary reliability of the product? Which of our sites are candidates for manufacturing? When this phase is over we have turned the theoretical concept into initial chip prototypes and have produced samples in small quantities.
Verification and validation
In the next step we check whether or not the product fulfills all the defined requirements. We provide our customers with samples so that they can test the product in the intended applications. At the same time the manufacturing technology is refined and a manufacturing plan is formulated so that the product can then be produced in larger quantities.
Ramp-up & volume production
The unit quantity of the new product is now continuously increased. Here we consider the entire value chain, from the supplier all the way to the customer. Stable processes are crucial in order to smoothly integrate the product in ongoing manufacturing activities. We use optical, electrical and statistical testing procedures to constantly guarantee the necessary product quality.
Once a product has reached "end-of-life", we remove it from production in a process planned on a long-term basis. We inform our customers with sufficient lead time and continue to supply the agreed level of quality. Often we have already developed a functionally improved successor product.
We continue to meet all our commitments – from the first chip to the very last.

OKWelcome to Infineon's Purchasing Site
Please take this opportunity to learn more about becoming our supplier. At we actively seek suppliers whose objectives are compatible with ours. Specifically, we are looking for a commitment to deliver products and services with high quality at competitive prices worldwide.
More than half of Infineon’s total costs occur with its suppliers. Only in close co-operation with our suppliersto optimize the whole value chain, we will achievesustainable competitive advantages in the future. values those suppliers who can contribute new ideas through innovative technology or creative business solutions.
Therefore we implemented optimized processes for our purchasing activities and built enabling organizational structures, using new leading technologies. Our suppliers must continuously improve their performance and thereby their costs as well as ours.
How to become a supplier
We at are committed to the principles defined in our Business Conduct Guidelines in all countries where we do business, taking into account international and local laws and cultural practices. We expect from our suppliers to do the same.
These Principles of Purchasing , which are aligned with Business Conduct Guidelines, shall help our suppliers to meet the ethical and legal requirements in their day-to-day work.
Security is becoming more and more important in the days of modern technologies. We at continuously strive to set our own security standards to state-of-the-art level.
Thus, we require a certain level of security measures to be taken by our supplier, which we summarized in the Supplier Security Guide , and which are in alignment with Technologies’ own security standards.
In case you have reason to believe, that we are not living up to our own standards, feel free to contact either our Purchasing Office (+49 89 234 45112 ) or our Corporate Audit Office (+49 89 234 23373).
We look forward to engage with suppliers that are aligned with us on these important topics.  
Quality Management
Our suppliers are fully responsible for the quality of their products. They must ensure that all products, supplied to Technologies, meet all applicable purchase specifications.
Each supplier must set up a quality management system that will achieve the requirements of the Purchase Specification part These requirements should be viewed as fundamental in any supplier's management system in order to support the Zero Defect approach of Technologies.
It is the responsibility of our suppliers to establish procedures and programs that document their quality practices.
The design and operation of the supplier's management systems to control and improve product quality are essential elements of continuing status as an acceptable supplier.
will review the supplier's management systems and their implementation and operation as appropriate.
Should a disaster strike and remove a key component of the supply chain or affect it beyond its current capability to adjust, it will have severe repercussions on our ability to continue business. Because we rely heavily on our supply chain, it is therefore extremely important for us to understand our exposure to risk in this area.
Hence has embarked on implementing a comprehensive Business Continuity Management system, and part of that is to assess the business continuity capabilities of all key suppliers, subcontractors or supply partners who engage in business with or intend doing so.
All key suppliers are therefore required to provide us with sufficient proof of business continuity management systems or planning, control and mitigation. Proof can be provided in the form of plans, concepts or measures that are product specific, while strategic enough to encompass risk assessment measures, disaster prevention and business interruption avoidance.
Suppliers will also be assessed on their risk management policies and practices as part of our supplier evaluation system.

Comprehensive term for the manufacture and processing of wafers with a diameter of 300 millimeters.
“Mixed-signal” is a generic term for integrated circuits that operate simultaneously with analog and digital signals. Owing to similar requirements in terms of development and manufacturing processes, they are generally grouped together with integrated circuits operating exclusively with analog signals, hence giving rise to the combination “analog-mixed-signal”.
Application Specific Integrated Circuit. Logic specially constructed for a specific application and customer; implemented on an integrated circuit.
Authentication means the ability to prove one’s own identity, i.e., proof of the authentic original. However, authentication does not necessarily refer to people only, but also to any tangible or intangible object, such as a device or an electronic document. user can be authenticated in any one of three different ways: 1.) By providing a certain piece of information, i.e., the user knows something, such as a password; 2.) Through the use of a possession, i.e., the user possesses something, such as a key; 3.) Through the direct presence of the user, i.e., the user is someone or something, such as in the form of a biometric feature.
The part of the semiconductor manufacturing process that happens after the wafer has left the cleanroom (see frontend manufacturing). This includes testing the chips at wafer level, repairing the chips if necessary, dicing the wafers and packaging the individual chips. There is a growing trend among semiconductor manufacturers to outsource the assembly, and sometimes even the testing, to independent assembly companies. Much of the assembly capacity is based in the Pacific Rim countries.
bare die is a single, unpackaged chip. Bare die business means the sale of fully processed, unpackaged chips. The packaging and subsequent testing of the packaged chips is performed by the customer. Bare die business is mostly conducted with module manufacturers that produce their own modules but not their own semiconductors.
power bipolar transistor is a specialized version of a bipolar transistor that is optimized for conducting and blocking large electric currents (up to several hundred amperes) and very high voltages (up to several 1,000 volts). In industry, the power bipolar transistor – like the power (see MOSFET) often used as an alternative – constitutes an important industrial semiconductor component for influencing electric current.
Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor. Standard semiconductor manufacturing technology used to manufacture microchips with low power usage and a high level of integration.
In contrast to silicon-based semiconductors, compound semiconductors consist of several chemical elements. The combination of materials from the chemical main group (e.g. gallium) and (e.g. nitrogen) have the electrical conductivity of semiconductors. This also applies to the combination of materials from the main group (carbon, silicon). These compound semiconductors (e.g. gallium nitride or silicon carbide) are therefore of highest importance in technical applications in semiconductor technology, especially for power semiconductors.
Control unit that can convert voltages of various rates and frequencies. This is achieved by means of power electronics. Converters are used in wind turbines, for example, in order to feed fluctuating wind energy into the power network with a voltage of constant frequency. In electric drive technology, for example, in engine controllers and trains, a converter is used to generate an output voltage of variable, load-dependent frequency from a mains supply of constant frequency.
From the Greek epi “upon” and taxis ”arrangement” or “orientation”. Epitaxy is a form of crystalline growth that occurs both in nature (such as in minerals) and in the technical world. In semiconductor technology, epitaxy is the artificial growth of crystalline layers on a substrate, which is usually a wafer. Epitaxy enables various doping profiles for transistors to be created, which are not feasible using other methods such as diffusion or ion implantation.
Flexible Transmission System – control systems used in electrical engineering. They are used in the field of electrical power supply to specifically control power transmission and distribution in networks, in which in principle components of power electronics and therefore power semiconductors such as modules are used. The controlling of power transfers can be implemented in alternating current networks by changing the idle and active power by means of capacitor batteries or compensation coils.
Frontend process is the designation for all process steps in cleanrooms that the entire wafer must complete. These are lithography, diffusion, ion implantation and application of circuitry levels. Some stations must be completed a number of times. At the end of the frontend process, the wafer may have been through as many as 500 individual process steps. After the conclusion of the frontend manufacturing, the processed wafers are transferred to backend manufacturing for testing and packaging (see Backend manufacturing).
Gallium nitride (abbreviated to GaN) is a compound semiconductor material made from gallium (chemical symbol Ga) and nitrogen (chemical symbol N). Gais used for components including radio-frequency power MOSFETs (see MOSFET) on account of the material’s special properties (such as good thermal conductivity and high electron mobility).
Chemical symbol of gallium nitride (see Gallium nitride).
sensor based on the Hall principle, used for measuring magnetic fields, named after the physicist Edwin Herbert Hall (1855 – 1938). Hall sensors are used in automobiles, for example, for detecting pedal positions or for measuring the speed at which shafts rotate.
High-voltage direct-current transmission. transmission is a method of transmitting electrical energy at high directcurrent voltages of up to 800,000 volts over distances of more than 1,000 kilometers. transmission is also used for connecting offshore wind farms to the electricity grid on the mainland.
Integrated Circuit. Electronic Component parts composed of semiconductor materials such as silicon; numerous components, including transistors, resistors, capacitors and diodes can be integrated into ICs and interconnected.
Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor Module. IGBTs are semiconductor components used increasingly in power electronics due to their robustness, high blocking voltage, and their ability to be triggered with negligible power. Modules are formed using several IGBTs in parallel within a single casing. These modules are used to drive electric motors both in automotive and industrial applications. Motor speed and torque can be regulated along a gradual scale. Trains such as Germany’s and France’s use modules for an efficient and rapid electrical drive control.
Integrity Guard (IG) is a revolutionary security technology designed for chip cards and security applications, with which is ringing in a new era in the field of hardware-based security. was specially developed for sophisticated, longlife applications such as payment cards and government identification documents. enables a security controller for the first time to provide complete error detection and comprehensive encryption of all chip functions across the entire data path within the chip. For this reason it is known as “digital security”. is used in the security controllers of the 77 and 78 families and has won numerous international awards.
An inverter, also called a DC/converter, is an electrical device for converting voltage into voltage, or direct current into alternating current. Inverters are used in solar power plants, for example, for converting the voltage generated in the solar modules into voltage, which is then fed into the electricity network.
Micro-electro-mechanical system. micro-electro-mechanical system, or simply a microsystem, is a miniaturized device, assembly or part that contains components of minute dimensions (only measurable in micrometers) that work together as a system. Usually a microsystem consists of one or more sensors, actuators and control electronics on one chip. manufactures microphones as Due to their diminutive size, low power consumption, good shielding from interfering signals and low-cost production, these types of microphone are being increasingly installed in mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, cameras, and accessories such as headsets and hearing aids.
Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor. is currently the most widely used transistor architecture. MOSFETs are used both in highly integrated circuits and in power electronics as special power MOSFETs.
Near field communication. An international communication standard for contactless data exchange over short distances. The initial drafts of the communication standard appeared several years ago, but the technology did not break through until 2011 when it was included in the first smartphones. can be used as an access key to content on terminals and for services such as cashless payment and paperless ticketing.
Power transistor is a term used in electronics to refer to a transistor for switching or controlling large voltages, currents and outputs. There is no standard method of differentiating between transistors for signal processing and power transistors. Power transistors are mainly produced in packages that enable installation on heat sinks, as it is otherwise impossible to handle the dissipation loss of several kilowatts that occurs with some types and applications.
special diode that has a metal-semiconductor junction rather than a semiconductor-semiconductor junction. The most frequently used semiconductor material up to 250 volts is silicon. Silicon carbide (SiC) is used for voltages in excess of 300 volts (see Silicon Carbide). SiSchottky diodes offer a number of advantages over conventional diodes in power electronics. When used together with transistors, it is possible to dramatically reduce switching losses in the diode itself, as well as in the transistor. The name derives from the German physicist Walter Schottky
(1886 – 1976).
Chemical symbol of silicon carbide (see Silicon carbide.
Compound semiconductor made from silicon (chemical symbol Si) and carbon (chemical symbol C). The abbreviation is SiBecause of its special material properties (e.g. good thermal conductivity), Siis used for Schottky diodes, as well as elsewhere (see Schottky diode).
switch-mode power supply is an electronic module that transforms an voltage into a voltage. Switch-mode power supplies are more efficient than mains transformers and can be more compact and lighter than conventional power supplies containing a heavy transformer with a ferrous core. Switch-mode power supplies are mainly used in PCs, notebooks and servers. However, they also achieve a very high level of efficiency even at low power, so they are increasingly found in plug-in power supply units, for example, as chargers for mobile phones.
wafer is typically around 350 microns (μm) thick when sawn into individual chips. thin wafer is one that has been polished down to less than 200 microns thick (a human hair or a sheet of paper, by comparison, is about 60 microns thick). Thin wafer technology offers benefits: Thinner chips mean losses can be reduced and the heat generated can be dissipated more effectively. Another advantage is that electrically active patterns can be produced on the backside as well, enabling the chip to provide completely new functions. Thin wafer chips also allow more compact packages.
Trusted Platform Module. chip that adds elementary security functions such as license and data protection to a computer or similar device. TPMs can be integrated into tablet PCs, smartphones and consumer electronics as well as PCs and notebooks. trusted computing platform (see Trusted Computing) can be created by combining a specially configured operating system and appropriate software with a device containing a TPM.
Trusted Computing means that the hardware and software used in PCs, as well as other computer-controlled systems, such as mobile phones, can be controlled. This is achieved by means of an additional chip, the Trusted Platform Module (TPM), which can use cryptography to measure the integrity of the hardware and of the software data structures, while also saving these values in a verifiable way.

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZOccupational Safety and Health
The safety and health of our employees is of highest priority at Infineon. Our concept for occupational safety mainly focuses on prevention, with the aim of creating a safe working environment which avoids the occurrence of workplace related accidents.
Our Occupational Safety and Health Management System in place at Infineon’s production sites and at Campeon corporate headquarters is certified in accordance with the 18001 certificate  standard and is designed to ensure that the required measures are taken to minimize the risks in the working environment that could endanger our employees.
Our employees are regularly informed about workplace-specific topics as well as about operational circumstances. Through extensive preventative measures, we create a safe working environment that minimizes the number of workplace accidents.
In addition to technical and organizational safety precautions, our employees in production sites have to use workplace specific personal protective equipment (PPE) to prevent hazard exposures, when necessary.
The recording and evaluation of work-related accident figures in the course of our data collection process and is performed in accordance with the requirements on the basis of the standardized Injury Rate (IR) and the Lost Day Rate (LDR). All work-related accidents that have led to more than one lost day are taken into account. The causes of occupational accidents are analyzed and if necessary, adequate improvement measures are implemented based on the investigations’ results.
Health and satisfaction at the workplace are essential requirements for the development of individual performance capability that contribute to Infineon’s overall success.
With a particular view to maintaining and promoting the mental health of staff, the project “Well-being@work” was launched in 2012. The aim of this project is to analyze and document factors that lead to mental stress and strain as well as to derive measures for maintaining and promoting the health of our employees.
The project is run jointly with employee representatives. On the basis of a staff questionnaire, lists the factors which contribute to psychological stresses at the workplace and identify which preventive measures can be taken to counter them. The following individual aspects are considered in the analysis: work tasks, work organization, social conditions at the workplace and also workplace design.

OKEnter a new world of security
From unlocking the door at home or work, to buying a ticket on the bus, to entering a sold-out stadium, a growing number of places have come to rely on an electronic access management system. This practical and convenient method of authentication or authorization determines who may, for example, gain entry to a building or space, or use a particular service. While an access management system offers numerous advantages – especially to those who use them – many existing systems have unsecure solutions in their access control infrastructure, making them especially vulnerable to attack. In the interest of reducing potential risks, businesses and institutions are readier than ever to migrate from a less secure closed, proprietary legacy system with vendor lock-in, to a newer, more efficient and secure one that is open source and non-proprietary.
The multi-faceted access management landscape
Nowadays, the market for access management systems is best described as highly fragmented. This is primarily due to the wide range of segments and applications the field covers. The scope ranges from corporate access control in office buildings and governmental institutions, to hotel room or sporting event access, to incorporation of loyalty and micropayment schemes, along with many others. Because each segment comes with its own list of security requirements, most access management system solutions are tricky, if not impossible, to scale. further drawback: their security level cannot easily be altered once a solution has been implemented.
Thankfully, we now have ways to change the status quo. With access management solutions that increase a system’s efficiency and performance while offering top functionality, flexibility, convenience and, of course, security.
With over 25 years of experience in the sector, Infineon’s access management system solutions make it easy to overcome biggest challenges while also ensuring designs are ready for whatever comes in the future. In our wide-ranging portfolio, you’ll find contactless security memory as well as contactless and dual interface security controllers that cover the full spectrum of access control and access management applications. Our cost-effective and secure solutions are interoperable and suitable for use in multi-application projects in which additional services such as micropayment or ticketing are combined with conventional access control functions. All are scalable and based on the same open, non-proprietary standard. They also comply with a range of specifications and standards, including EMVCo, Calypso, and, last but not least, CIPURSE™ .
CIPURSE™ is an open, international non-proprietary security standard suitable for a wide range of contactless applications. The standard enables multi-purpose and multi-application cases on one device and can be flexibly implemented in a wide spectrum of form factors to meet a project’s specific requirements. Furthermore, it’s the only global open standard for secure, cost-effective access management solutions that overcomes the limitations of proprietary to provide a future-proof path for access management – and beyond.
Security is of utmost importance to everyone involved in access management. You can increase your system security and protect your reputation with Infineon’s CIPURSE™ products that use the advanced 128 encryption algorithm. They enable fast, secure transitions and eliminate fraud problems that compromise many proprietary systems.
We also offer full infrastructure support to help you quickly integrate a solution into existing access management infrastructure. Discover, for instance, our ready-to-use CIPURSE™ (Secure Access Module) . It provides a set of security algorithms along with an integrated key management system based on a certified security controller. We also provide additional security for convergence in addition to a wide range of evaluation kits to accelerate the development process of your access management project.
In addition to giving you peace of mind and helping you get started, sourcing products provides you with a host of unparalleled system benefits. They include:
Greater efficiency and performance. Proprietary access system deployments are replaced by future-oriented platforms based on open standards – embedded within a rich ecosystem.
Secured by AES-128 encryption. For secure data transfer and key scheduling production. Also available: 5+(h) for hardware.
Interoperability. In addition to the security solution, implementing new smart services with success hinges on interoperability across both legacy and new contactless infrastructures.
Scalability. Open standards make it easy to scale projects, using a single-family concept suitable for low- to high-end security controllers. 
Multi-sourcing flexibility. From vendor neutrality to lowest implementation cost and BOM.
In combination, these advantages lead to outstanding synergies for the entire access management ecosystem. Simply put, everyone benefits: the card and reader manufacturer, system integrator, service provider – and the actual person using the access management system on a day-to-day basis.
Keep exploring to find access management solutions for your project. Reach out to us anytime – we would be pleased to assist you.
