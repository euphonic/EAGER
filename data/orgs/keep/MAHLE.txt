Dual group strategy
dual group strategy
Our technological strategy is the further optimization of internal combustion engines and, at the same time, we will push ahead with the development of electromobility.
With our strategic orientation, we are addressing megatrends such as population growth, urbanization, globalization, connectivity, or limiting emissions to promote climate protection. We not only see these as an opportunity for further growth, but as an obligation to design our technologies so that mobility on our planet is as environmentally friendly as possible.

Qualitätsmanagement bei "Good quality is of crucial importance. There is always room for improvement!"
This position of company founder Ernst still serves as a model for us today.
For our customers, quality means failure-free assembly, satisfied end customers, no product recalls—and thus a strong brand. For MAHLE, quality is a significant factor in our global success. Quality management is fully integrated into all business processes. We have developed an in-house Group standard for quality planning and controlling.
The Quality Improvement Program
Our aim is to supply our customers with “best-in-class” quality. For this reason, we launched the group-wide Quality Improvement Program during the year under review. The program aims to further improve the traceability of causes of defects and thereby increase the effectiveness of both specific solutions and quality assurance overall. This also includes supplier quality.
quality awards from customers in 2017
Zero-defect principle
Potential defect sources are already eliminated during product development.

 © by  GmbH, Stuttgart 2005 - 2019 Our locations around the world continuously strive to further reduce waste volumes and emissions as well as the consumption of energy and water.
We consider it to be our most important task to harmonize the future of humanity with technical progress.
The basis for this is our environmental management system, introduced in 1996, which we maintain as part of the Business Processes. All aspects of safety at work, health care, and environmental protection are taken into consideration. As early as the planning stage for plants and processes, we take care to analyze risks and thus to ensure preventive safety at work, health care, and environmental protection in equal measure.
Targeted employee information facilitates responsible action at all levels. At the same time, our employees provide us with valuable suggestions for further improvements. Our Group-wide process structure, which sets global standards, ensures that procedures from the planning stage to implementation can be implemented completely in line with integrated safety at work, health care, and environmental protection.
strives to make its products as energy- and resource-efficient as possible.
Environmentally sound product design is an important consideration when developing new products. These basic principles also apply to our operational processes, which are designed to conserve energy and resources, following the standards 14001 and 50001, as well as 18001. By taking appropriate measures, also ensures that environmentally harmful events are avoided and limited in the case of damage. To this end, we invest in environmentally friendly, state-of-the-art technologies and actively support global climate protection efforts. Species conservation and diversity considerations are also taken into account in planning measures. Fulfilling the general obligation of due diligence in protected areas is second nature to MAHLE.

Contribution to environmentally-friendly mobility
The greatest contribution to environmental relief is provided by our core products. The innovative technologies, which reduce fuel consumption and emissions, have a permanent positive impact on the environmental balance in millions of vehicles worldwide. Reducing weight and friction in pistons and other engine components represents our contribution to improving efficiency and emission control.

The success story begins in 1920 when pistons made of heavy gray cast iron were being used in internal combustion engines for automobiles. The brothers countered this trend by producing light-alloy pistons at their small, newly established company—but the technology is still finicky and problems come up frequently. To keep dirt and dust out of the engine, they eventually developed air and oil filters as well. Their perseverance paid off: the light-alloy pistons began to take over the market.
Nowadays, half of all automobiles produced worldwide contain components. has developed from a small test workshop to a technologically leading, globally active Group.
Renewal. Development. Breakthrough
From a small test workshop to a leader in technology and an industrial enterprise: the central issue at the time is whether the light-alloy piston favored by Ernst can replace the gray cast iron piston. New alloys and the invention of the ring carrier piston by Ernst finally provide the breakthrough.
War. Armament. Destruction
The darkest chapter in German history—national socialism and World War II—also leaves a deep mark on the development of as a company: with aircraft, cars, and commercial vehicles being built primarily for military purposes, EC—known as from 1938—becomes a supplier to the armament industry because of its product range.

Engagement for biodynamic seed breeding
Each year the Foundation supports approximately 150 projects worldwide. In doing so, it works in accordance with the central idea of "Donate today - with the vision for tomorrow".
The aim is to enable a better future by supporting innovative projects. In line with the anthroposophical thinking and actions of its founders, the leitmotifs which form the basis of all of the Foundation's work are appreciation of and responsibility towards other people, the environment and nature.
In 1964, company founders Hermann and Dr. Ernst transferred 99.9 percent of their ownership of the Company to the Foundation and 0.1 percent to MABEG, which was entitled sole voting rights in the corporation. The objective was to take the Company out of the line of succession in order to avoid possible fragmentation. moderate yet stable distribution of profits to the Foundation was to allow the Company to make extensive long-term investments and achieve further growth. It was also intended to ensure sustainable project work of the foundation.
