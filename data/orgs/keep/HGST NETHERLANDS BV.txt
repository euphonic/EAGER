Innovation at Western Digital: The Data Revolution Begins Here
Innovation has always fueled and nurtured growth at Western Digital. It is as important now, as any time in our history. From advanced data centers to mobile devices, artificial intelligence to IoT, revolutionary data analysis to tomorrow’s brightest technology, data is transforming our lives and helping us to thrive.
Chief Technology Officer
The Office has the responsibility to look beyond the current state of technology to identify opportunities for Western Digital. Internal and external teams investigate technology areas aligned to our objectives to generate value from data and be stewards of its future potential.
Learn about some of the ongoing investigation topics within the Office by clicking the links below, these investigations support storage of data, gaining insights and generating value from data.
Big Data applications, like Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, require access to a large dataset to train the algorithm or neural network. This creates a need to move all the data required by the application to the processor. Moving large amounts of data over a network takes time, money, and ties up network bandwidth. This is not a sustainable or optimum approach.
The root cause resides in the current von Neumann computer architecture, followed for over 30 years. In this model, the rest of the computer system revolves around the processor (termed a “general computing architecture.”). One proposed solution is to make the memory the focal point of the computer architecture–memory-centric computer architecture. However, implementation is complex since all current operating systems and applications are built around the von Neumann computer.Multiple processors, using a large pool of memory, need to implement cache coherency to avoid two processors attempting to access or rewrite a memory location that might be needed by another processor. The move to highly-parallel processing has made some inroads into multiple cores accessing memory cache and coherency, however they have used a relatively small memory space. Expanding the shared memory to multiple TB’s of data adds more complexity to the shift in architecture. Our investigations are directed at understanding what it will take to transition to a memory-centric architecture.
Two different memory technologies are currently used as the memory that is accessed by the CPU, and Both are volatile, meaning data stored will be lost when the power fails or is turned off. new class of memory (Persistent or Storage Class Memory, SCM) is being developed that is non-volatile i.e. data does not disappear when power is lost
Memory located close to the needs fast access time, or latency close to the clock speed, for it to be used as cache memory. The latency of both and data storage devices is too slow to be used. Differentiating memory from storage is key when discussing this topic (here, memory refers to bit-addressable memory utilized for registers and cache accessed by the CPU, while storage refers to devices using systems to organize and store data, and is not bit-addressable).
Some designs of non-volatile memory with low latency can compete with DRAM: these are called (Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory) or STT-(Spin Transfer Torque Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory). Other technologies that are between and in latency are (Phase Change Memory) or Re(Resistive Random Access Memory). Western Digital has researched non-volatile memory for several years, ranging from basic materials research (including cell physics and design), to memory cell array fabrication and testing. All these efforts will be combined when a product is launched into this emerging market. These three areas are the “hardware” side of this technology. Other research targets the “software” implications of the transition to non-volatile memory.
Persistent Memory Programming Models
Software programmers have been writing software for years using volatile and SRAM, consequently there are many provisions in the code to deal with this fact. What will happen if is replaced with persistent nonvolatile memory? Additionally if memory is added to the computer or server that is close to in latency, how would this new (Storage Class Memory) be used? What changes would need to be made to the kernel and operating system? How does this impact the Saa(Storage as a Service) segment of the industry? How does this impact the disaster recovery segment? In reality every segment of the software hierarchy will need to review how this change would impact their products and services. Changes do not happen overnight, so there will be a period of time during the transformation to non-volatile memory where the path is not clear, backward compatibility must be considered. Alternatively companies may choose to offer products based on the new memory configuration of the computer system to quickly take advantage of the non-volatile memory. Will adoption of the change impact cloud providers first, or will enterprise data centers lead the way?
With the number of unknowns associated with this transformation how does one go about it? If you step back and think about persistent memory it has the potential to be one of the most disruptive technologies introduced to the industry, and it has the potential to impact our daily interaction with our devices. Changing an entire industry will take time, working with standardization groups, working with the open source community, working with companies with closed code.
Artificial Intelligence
Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence
Western Digital’s memory-centric activities requires an understanding of the use cases that would benefit from a memory-centric architecture, the use case we have chosen is Machine Learning (ML). Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence are fast becoming part of our everyday life, and looking forward it will continue to develop and play a role in many aspects of our life. Western Digital does have engineering projects investigating the use of & in our products and processes, however the efforts in the Office are directed at & needs in the future. Two main areas of investigations driven by the Office are accelerators and algorithms, both of which are continuing to evolve.
Specially designed accelerators are particularly useful for & applications. An accelerator is designed for a specific application where the microarchitecture and instruction set are limited to only what is needed for applications. Because of this accelerators are function specific and greatly reduce the time it takes to process a large data set. Accelerators are an example of a how specialized chips are augmenting the traditional general computing CPU’s to reduce both time and energy requirements for applications. Studies have shown a potential of ~10x or more improvement in energy and processing speed when comparing standard designs to optimized designs for a specific workload. Applications using & are skyrocketing currently, creating opportunities for accelerators designed specifically for these data intensive applications.
Storage-Centric Architectures
While Memory-Centric compute is being discussed as an architecture optimized for applications like & ML, there is a different architecture when discussing “Storage-Centric” architecture.
Storage-Centric puts compute capability into the storage devices, minimizing the amount of data requiring transfer to a central compute location. This is useful for very large datasets, where it would be cost prohibitive to move all the data to compute. Genomics is an example of a fast- growing and immense dataset that would benefit from a storage-centric architecture. Advances in sequencing generates large amounts of data, not just with human but with other species too. We expect this trend to continue as research into “personalized” medicine treatments based on a person’s sequence are developed.
While not yet implemented, this is a trend that will mature over time. Generating value and insight from sequencing requires the filtering a large dataset to find matches to specified sequences; this is a highly parallelizable process that can be accelerated in hardware and adds value to end users. These are some of the reasons we are investigating genomics as a use case to develop hardware and software for storage-centric compute. The potential benefit to humanity from faster processing of genomics data is one that Western Digital recognizes as an example of how data can improve our lives.
Big Data and Fast Data applications are transforming enterprise environments involving core activities on-premises and on hyper-scale cloud infrastructure, as well as those that occur at the network’s edge, with new hubs or “data depots” emerging to address the locality and speed of access to data. Regional, local and remote data centers, and/or points of data aggregation, now provide opportunities to transform and add value to data as it flows from Ioand other edge applications, into the core of the network where it can be processed and analyzed to deliver actionable insights and value. Each of these data depots will require unique compute architectures and advanced data processing requirements paving the way for RISC--- an open, scalable instruction set architecture (ISA) designed to meet the diverse application needs of Big Data and Fast Data in this data-centric world. 
Supporting the RISC-Ecosystem
To further accelerate open standard interfaces and RISC-processing architectures, Western Digital offers three open-source innovations designed to support both internal RISC-development efforts as well as those of the growing RISC-ecosystem. 
SweCore and SweISS
The Western Digital SweCore™ EHX1 is a 32-bit, 2-way superscalar, 9 stage pipeline core. With an expected simulation performance of up to 5.0 CoreMarks/Mhz1 and small footprint, it offers compelling capabilities for embedded devices supporting data-intensive edge applications, such as storage controllers, industrial IoT, real-time analytics in surveillance systems, and other smart systems. The power-efficient design also offers clock speeds of up to 1.8Ghz1 on a 28mm process technology. The SweCore will be used in Western Digital products in the coming years. The SweCore is now open sourced for the RISC-community to utilize and contribute to.
SweISS™ (Instruction Set Simulator) is also available with full test bench support for validation of RISC-cores. This open-source was developed independently from the SweCore to ensure RISC-cores are executing instructions properly. The Swemodels closely coupled memories, caches, interrupts and more. It was used to rigorously simulate and validate the SweCore, with more than 10 billion instructions executed.
The Future of Data Infrastructure
At Flash Memory Summit 2018, Western Digital unveiled its new OpenFlex™ architecture and product family, as well as a comprehensive set of open standards to address the complex and dynamic data workload demands of high-scale private and public cloud data centers.
Western Digital participates in multiple collaborations with external organizations with a mission to provide Western Digital access to resources and knowledge that can be applied to improving current products, development of new technologies or products, and generate value from the data stored on our devices.
In addition to giving presentations at various conferences the Office also publishes technical articles in relevant journals. Have a look at our publications from the past few years, hopefully you will notice how our focus has been realigned after merging of Western Digital, and SanDisk in 2016. The ability of our researchers to adapt to the changing landscape of the data storage is one of our strengths.
