Over one hundred years ago, on August 16, 1912, Glenn established the Glenn Company in Los Angeles, California. He started the company after building his first plane in a rented church, where he took a leap of faith on his risky but innovative new aircraft design at the urging of none other than Orville Wright.
Four months later and four hundred miles away, on December 19, 1912, Allan and Malcolm founded the Alco Hydro-Aeroplane Company, later renamed the Aircraft Company. Talented mechanics, they set up shop out of a  garage, constructing seaplanes that would shatter speed and distance records for overwater flights.

The gift that and the brothers shared was a unique ability to look past the obstacles of today to the promise of a brighter tomorrow.

We seek to improve business practices to best serve customers, employees and other stakeholders across five core issues: 
Integrity is a cornerstone of our business strategy. Poor ethical judgment by government contractors presents risks to future business opportunities and jeopardizes our customer’s ability to protect their citizens. Our high standards for integrity define how we do business and make us a partner of choice for the most sensitive and critical customer missions.

By recognizing the nexus between customer needs and sustainability, we can design solutions that deliver greater value to our customers and society in terms of product impact and total cost of ownership.
Employee Wellbeing
Our business succeeds when our employees thrive. Employees with diverse backgrounds and perspectives contribute to our high-performance environment and enhance our competitiveness as an employer of choice. We prioritize talent recruitment, talent development, workforce safety and diversity and inclusion to meet customer needs and innovate for the future.
Our lifecycle-based assessments show our operations’ biggest opportunities are to reduce energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our largest overall challenge is the environmental footprint of our products during the customer use phase, constituting nearly 70 percent of our impact. Financially, we could be affected by future remediation requirements or regulations developed in response to federal, state, local and global concerns for climate risks, other aspects of the environment or natural resources. We reduce our footprint, and that action results in industry-leading outcomes. The Board of Directors and the Executive Leadership Team review our environmental performance at least twice annually.
The world is increasingly connected through, and reliant on, digital infrastructure to support business, enhance production and drive innovation. Global information system security is critical to smoothly functioning, stable societies and affects governments, militaries, energy grids, communications systems and health records. systems and products safeguard crucial information for customers. Our infrastructure is routinely threatened by hacktivists, cyber criminals, insider threats and advanced persistent threats. Our ability to protect employee personal information is integral to mission success and trust.

Martin’s relationship with Saudi Arabia began in 1965 with the first delivery of the Kingdom’s C-130 Hercules airlifter. Since then, our business has diversified to other security solutions such as integrated air and missile defense, and maritime and civilian applications such as satellite communications, air traffic control and energy solutions. With more than 50 years of experience as a trusted government and industry partner with the Kingdom, our presence in the country is focused on supporting economic diversification and the realization of the national objectives defined in the Saudi Vision 2030 development plan, through the deployment of technological solutions that promote long-term growth.
“Our goal is to deliver advanced technology and security solutions to the Saudi government and commercial sector in support of Vision 2030.”
Joseph Rank, Chief Executive for Saudi Arabia
Today, Saudi Arabia is home to one of the largest fleets of Hercules airlifters in the world. We’ve significantly expanded our presence in the Kingdom, as we develop partnerships that have created local jobs in the security, aerospace and commercial sectors. That expansion continues today. In 2016, we officially opened our new sustainment facility, where advanced sensor systems for Saudi Arabia’s fleet of F-15 aircraft will be repaired. The new center is a collaboration with one of Saudi Arabia’s leading electronic engineering firms, Advanced Electronics Company, and represents one of many valuable partnerships – partnerships that, together with our training programs, help to unleash the energy and creativity of the Saudi people.
Saudi Vision 2030 includes a directive for the Kingdom’s defense industry to be localized. In support of efforts to build a robust national industrial base, supports the achievement of the country’s security ambitions through various strategic partnerships with leading Saudi companies.

Defining the Future of Aerospace
Our purpose hasn’t changed. The Skunk Works® team remains connected to founder Kelly Johnson’s vision of a place where small empowered teams created powerful solutions. What Skunk Works cared about in 1943 is what we care about today. Our customers’ missions define our purpose. We thank them for their partnership and allowing us to serve them for 75 years, and we stand ready to tackle their more important missions for the next 75 years and beyond.

Inside Skunk Works Podcast
Skunk Works Approach 
No mission is impossible. Skunk Works is committed to quickly developing disruptive solutions to ensure our nation has an absolute advantage.
What sets the Skunk Works apart is its unique approach created by founder Kelly Johnson. This approach is still evidenced today by the small empowered teams, streamlined processes and the culture that values the lessons learned when you are bold enough to attempt something that hasn’t been done before. See 
 for the approach in action. 
Unlike most of the work that we do at the Skunk Works, our spirit of innovation is no secret. We thrive on solving difficult problems, and that “can-do” attitude has led to many aerospace firsts and countless disruptive technology innovations.
Our unique organization started in 1943 when visionary Clarence “Kelly” Johnson got the green light to create an experimental engineering department to begin work on the secret 
 jet fighter. Johnson and his team designed and built the XP-80 in only 143 days, seven less than was required. It was this project that marked the birth of what would become the Skunk Works with Kelly Johnson at its helm.
What allowed Johnson to operate the Skunk Works so effectively and efficiently was his unconventional organizational approach. He broke the rules, challenging the current bureaucratic system that stifled innovation and hindered progress. His philosophy is spelled out in his "
14 rules and practices
It is this unique approach that’s garnered seven 
 and the National Medal of Technology. Furthermore, our willingness to take risks to advance aerospace technology has made responsible for more or experimental planes than any other company in the industry.
Just like when we started, we’re not big on titles or protocol – we simply tackle the toughest technical challenges, regularly meeting schedules on time and under budget.
