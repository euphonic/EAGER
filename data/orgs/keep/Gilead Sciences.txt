Ethics and Code of Conduct
Our Employees
The Code of Ethics requires employees' compliance with all laws and mandates fair dealing in all instances. Violations of our Code of Ethics by employees are not tolerated and can lead to disciplinary action, including termination of employment and referral for criminal prosecution. As part of our commitment to ensure our products are free from violations of all types of ethical standards, we plan to update our Code of Ethics and employee training materials to include provisions specifically targeted to address human slavery and trafficking.
Countries of Origin
We routinely evaluate and address the risk of ethical violations for all countries involved in our supply chain. We do not routinely engage a third party to conduct this evaluation. Rather, we rely on official government information to identify risks and act accordingly. Our product ingredients are sourced primarily from countries the United States Department of State has designated as being compliant with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act's (TVPA) minimum standards. We take extra precautions before sourcing product from countries that are still making efforts to bring themselves into full compliance with the For example, in those countries, we source only from businesses that are affiliated with countries fully compliant with TVPA, visit our suppliers along with their intermediates and vendors in person and only select suppliers that have been in business long enough to verify that their conduct meets Gilead's ethical standards.
