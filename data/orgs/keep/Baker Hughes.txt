Asset Performance Management 
Asset and equipment management has never been more crucial for the oil and gas industry.  Asset performance, corrosion management, and process management enable optimal reliability, availability, and performance of your most critical assets. By integrating applied Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep learning techniques into day-to-day workflows, Asset Performance Management (APM) software helps operators develop strategies that minimize risk and cost and dramatically reduce unplanned downtime by predicting equipment failures before they occur.
Software Delivers:
Enterprise-wide view of assets: Unified, comprehensive, and validated data repository related to expected performance at the asset, plant, and enterprise level
Corrosion-related risk management : Gain critical insights, increase reliability, and minimize operation costs by transforming manual inspection data into predictive intelligence
Continuous interrogation of data against process model: Ability to predict and quantify operational decisions in near real time using advanced analytics
Plant Optimization: Integration of process simulations and models provides connectivity between operations, assets, people and business for end-to-end optimization
BHGE's portfolio of solutions includes: Health, Reliability and Availability, Strategy, Integrity, and Process Management.
