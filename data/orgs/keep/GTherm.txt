Innovative Technologies for Oil, Gas and Power Markets
GTherm, Inc. (“GTherm”) is dedicated to the development of environmentally-sound innovations for use in the energy and other markets.
Energy, Inc. is the developer of proprietary ‘clean’ oil and gas extraction technology. The Comprehensive Energy System uniquely combines several field-proven legacy oil and gas extraction approaches into a single, thermally-driven system to volumetrically recover greater quantities of oil and gas, sequester CO2 and, where applicable, generate baseload electricity.
Exotex, Inc. is the developer of proprietary high-temperature tolerant and/or corrosion resistant advanced composite materials that outperform conventional materials (carbon fiber, broadly termed “fiber reinforced composites “FRCs”). Exotex epoxies when used to saturate woven or spun materials and products (including pipes) will perform in “high temperature” and/or caustic environments, with “high tensile strength”, impact-resistant, moisture absorption resistance.
GEO, Inc. is the developer of the Single-Well Engineered Geothermal System™ (“SWEGS”) for the generation of baseload geothermal power. is a closed system that does not require building a water reservoir and emit zero 6HG.
