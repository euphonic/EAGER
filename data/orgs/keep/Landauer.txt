The team provides a one-on-one experience that can’t be beat.
Olav takes the time to teach and brings the experience of other hospitals to bear. With his help, we keep up with regulatory issues, including being ready for The Joint Commission survey. After attending the 2017 Clinical Dose Optimization Symposium and hearing Olav speak, defined more precisely my role as Quality Assurance Technologist and now serve at multiple sites for Peoria. I’m excited to put new protocols in place and teach my colleagues – and continue to rely on Olav’s expertise.”

Social Media IconsSince 1954, has been providing state-of-the-art technology and unparalleled customer service within the radiation safety industry to better understand and document information related to occupational, environmental and health care-related exposure to ionizing radiation.
The quest began with an awareness by Robert Landauer, Jr., of the inherent hazards of the nascent nuclear medicine and nuclear energy industries. Now more than 60 years later, the Company continues to provide complete radiation dosimetry services to hospitals, medical and dental offices, universities, national laboratories, nuclear facilities and other industries in which radiation poses a potential threat to employees.
LANDAUER's groundbreaking contributions to the field of radiation safety have grown in scope and sophistication, developing new detection and monitoring technologies that continue to set industry standards. This history of innovation includes:
CR-39 plastic detectors
Digital dosimetry platform
Today, is the leading global provider of technical and analytical services to determine occupational and environmental radiation exposure and the leading domestic provider of outsourced medical physics services.
It provides dosimetry services to about 1.8 million individuals globally. In addition, the Medical Physics division provides therapeutic and imaging physics services throughout the country.
works closely with both customers and government entities to develop best practices in risk mitigation, and guides the development of occupational and public health and safety regulations. Our historical practice of dosimeter archiving has resulted in the only existing national registry of radiation exposure data.
LANDAUER's innovations in radiation safety continue to shape the industry in dosimetry and medical physics.
In 2017, it was announced that Fortive, a diversified industrial growth company comprised of Professional Instrumentation and Industrial Technologies businesses, would acquire LANDAUER.
