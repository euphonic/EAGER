Our Research
With a growing portfolio of products and an increasingly comprehensive range of services, our investment in Research and Technology is a key focus.
Two-thirds of our investment is aimed at improving the environmental performance of our products, for example investing in low-carbon technologies like nuclear energy.
key element in our approach to technology acquisition is our three-phase Vision Programme. Developing the right technologies means looking far into the future and generating a vision of what the needs of our customers will be. Technology acquisition is therefore planned over three time horizons:
Vision 5 describes the technologies that we currently have available 'off-the-shelf'. They will be incorporated into new products, such as the aero Trent gas turbine, while some existing engines will be modified to incorporate these proven technologies. Vision5 will ensure that current products remain market leaders in every aspect of performance, reliability and cost.
Vision 10 - the next generation
Vision 10 embodies technologies currently at the validation stage which are due to be commercially available in the medium-term to up to ten years from now. The next generation of our market-leading products will rely largely on Vision10 technologies.
Vision 20 - exploring new ideas
Vision 20 technologies target future generations of products in a 20-year timeframe. These are at the strategic research stage – emerging or as yet unproven – but will ensure that we are prepared for future market developments by focusing our extensive research base (including universities and institutions) on the technology requirements of future generations of products.
Advanced Manufacturing Research Centres
The Axnetwork is comprised of seven Advanced Manufacturing Research Centres helping us and other industrial partners achieve Best in Class capability across our portfolio of manufacturing technologies.
Research and University Technology Centres
We have an established global network of research centres. Each centre addresses a key technology; and collectively they tackle a wide range of engineering disciplines.

has remained one of the most famous names in engineering throughout the world, find out more about our history and the keys milestones that have helped shape us.
grew from the electrical and mechanical business established by Henry Royce in 1884. Royce built his first motor car in 1904 and in May of that year met Charles Rolls, whose company sold quality cars in London.
An agreement was reached that Royce Limited would manufacture a range of cars to be exclusively sold by Rolls & Co – they were to bear the name Rolls-Royce.
Success with the cars led to the formation of the company in March 1906 and to the launch of the six-cylinder Silver Ghost which, within a year, was hailed as 'the best car in the world'.
At the start of the First World War, in response to the nation's needs, Royce designed his first aero engine – the Eagle, providing some half of the total horsepower used in the air war by the allies.
The Eagle powered the first direct transatlantic flight as well as the first flight from England to Australia – both in the Vickers Vimy aircraft.
The late 1920s saw us develop the 'R' engine to power Britain's entry in the International Schneider Trophy seaplane contest. It established a new world air speed record of over 400mph in 1931.
Subsequently it established new world records on both land and water. More importantly, as subsequent events were to prove, it gave us the technological base to develop the Merlin, which Royce has begun to work on before his death in 1933.
The Merlin powered the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire in the Battle of Britain. Demand for the Merlin during the Second World War transformed us from a relatively small company into a major contender in aero propulsion.
In parallel, we began development of the aero gas turbine, pioneered by Sir Frank Whittle.
The Welland engine entered service in the Gloster Meteor fighter in 1944 and we had the confidence immediately after the war to commit ourselves to the gas turbine, in which it had a technological lead.
We entered the civil aviation market with the Dart in the Vickers Viscount. It was to become the cornerstone of universal acceptance of gas turbines by the airline industry.
The Avon-powered Comet became the first turbojet to enter transatlantic service and in 1960, the Conway engine in the Boeing 707 became the first turbofan to enter airline service.
The other major manufacturers in Britain between the wars were Armstrong Siddeley, Blackburn, Bristol, de Havilland and Napier.
The leader among these was Bristol which, in 1959, merged with the motor car and aero-engine maker Armstrong Siddeley. Three other smaller engine companies were absorbed into Bristol Siddeley and in 1961.
Finally, the capability of the British aero-engine industry was consolidated when we merged with Bristol Siddeley in 1966.
With the emergence of the widebody airliners in the late 1960s, we launched the RB211 for the Lockheed L-1011 Tri-Star.
Early problems with the RB211 led to the company being taken into state ownership, and the flotation of the motor car business in 1973 as a separate entity.
The three-shaft turbofan concept of the RB211 has now established itself at the heart of our world-class family of engines.
We returned to the private sector, undergoing a number of mergers and acquisitions to create the only company in Britain capable of delivering power for use in the air, at sea and on land.
In 1990, we formed an aero engines joint venture with of Germany. 
We took full control of the joint venture from January 2000. The legal name of the company is now Deutschland Ltd & Co KG.
Allison Engine Company in Indianapolis was acquired. 
Allison brought with it major new civil engines including the AE3007 for Embraer's new regional jet, and existing, successful defence programmes.
Motor Cars was sold by Vickers to Volkswagen, although hold the rights to the name and the marque for use on cars, having acquired the rights from for £40m in 1998.
took over responsibility for cars from the beginning of 2003.
We took full control of our oil and gas joint venture, Cooper Rolls, with the acquisition of the rotating compression equipment interests of Cooper Energy Services. 
We also acquired National Airmotive in California, a major repair and overhaul facility now part of Engine Services.
The 1990s ended with the £576m acquisition of Vickers which, with primarily the Ulstein and Kamewa products and capabilities joining the our existing gas turbine activities, transformed us into the global leader in marine power systems.
We celebrated our centenary throughout 2004 with a series of special events for customers, partners from education and industry, as well as employees, families and friends in the UK, Germany, Scandinavia North America and the Far East.
We opened our 6,000 square metre Marine facility in Shanghai.
Located in the Nanhui industrial zone in Shanghai, the facility is equipped with specialised machinery and a 200-strong workforce, including a growing team of service engineers.
The revolutionary tiltrotor aircraft known as the V-22 Osprey went into its first operational use with the Marine Corps, transforming troop deployment.
The Trent 1000 is the only engine optimised specifically for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. It ran for the first time in 2006.
The MT30 marine gas turbine was selected to power the Navy’s first two DDG-1000 multi-mission destroyers.
In October the Trent 900 was the first engine to power the Airbus A380 into service with Singapore Airlines. The A380 is the world’s largest airliner and has four engines per aircraft.
In 2009 work began on a manufacturing and assembly facility at Crosspointe in the United States. 
The decision to build a large-engine assembly plant and a new wide-chord fan blade factory in Seletar, Singapore, was announced, the first of these to be built outside the UK.
We celebrated the first flight of six of our customers’ aircraft: the Boeing 787; Gulfstream G650; Airbus A400M; Embraer Legacy 650, the Systems Mantis and the AgustaWestland Lynx Wildcat helicopter.
marine power saw the Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship go on active duty, the first sailing of the Royal Navy’s Astute class submarine and the commissioning of the Royal Navy’s first Type 45 Destroyer, Daring.
The engine for the Airbus A350, the Trent XWB, ran for the first time in June. 
At this point 1,150 Trent engines were already on order promising to make the Trent the most successful member of the Trent family.
Our naval business secured a breakthrough order from the Navy to power 10 Littoral Combat Ships with MT30 marine gas turbine engines. This represents the largest naval surface vessel contract the Group has signed to this date. In the UK, six Type 45 Destroyers for the Royal Navy are launched, equipped with our highly-efficient WR-21 gas turbine power system.
Early in 2010, the short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) version of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter deployed our unique LiftSystem® for the first time.
The Trent 1000 is the first engine to power Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which went into service on 26 October 2011 with All Nippon Airways (ANA).
 production Trent 700 engine is delivered to Cathay Pacific in November.
In May 2011, the Government awarded us the contract to develop a new propulsion system for the next generation of nuclear-powered submarines.
The short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) variant of the F-35Lightning Joint Strike Fighter entered service with the Marine Corps and deliveries were made to the MoD.
The Apprentice Academy opened in Rolls-Royce, Derby, on the 2nd November 2012, equipped with workshops containing the very latest machines, tooling and software to help train the high-class engineers of the future.
The Trent engine takes to the skies for the first time on an Airbus A380 test aircraft in Toulouse, France. The aircraft flew with one of its four Trent 900 engines replaced by the Trent XWB.

Research & Technology
The strategy takes into account the trends that will define the world’s future power needs.
Our strategy consists of five elements:
We will invest in new power solutions for our long-term success.
We are building on our strong heritage in mechanical engineering to produce state-of-the-art electro-mechanical and hybrid power systems. Today, we already combine our engines in hybrid systems for trains, ships and micro-grids.
Vitalise existing capabilities
We will develop next generation technologies to sustain and grow our current competitiveness.
We are investing in our existing thermomechanical products to ensure that they provide the cleanest, safest and most competitive solutions for our customers. For example, the UltraFan® represents a fundamental upgrade of our gas turbines, incorporating eleven breakthrough technologies.
Reinvent with digital
We will be Digital First in everything we do to generate new insights, new solutions and new opportunities.
We are renowned as a pioneer in the use of digital solutions for our customer care. We are continuously enhancing the digital twin of our physical activities and seeking new data innovations.
Transform our business
We will fundamentally change the way we do business to generate substantial value for our stakeholders.
We are implementing and improving the Operating System. Digitalisation allows us to create entirely new ways of engineering, manufacturing and serving our customers across the Group.
Build balanced portfolio
We will seek new markets and products that bring new technologies and capabilities, and generate scale and synergies.
We are investing to manage the transition towards electrification and digitalisation. We mitigate the risk of long-term investment by increasing our preparedness. For example, by developing activities where electrification is relevant today, such as micro-grids, we will be better placed to benefit in activities where electrification is still some years away, such as aero-engines.
Our business system
To implement our strategy, we have refined the business system that we use across all of our Business Units. It is a virtuous cycle driven by the ability of technology
Our business system consists of five stages:

Our Research
With a growing portfolio of products and an increasingly comprehensive range of services, our investment in Research and Technology is a key focus.
Two-thirds of our investment is aimed at improving the environmental performance of our products, for example investing in low-carbon technologies like nuclear energy.
key element in our approach to technology acquisition is our three-phase Vision Programme. Developing the right technologies means looking far into the future and generating a vision of what the needs of our customers will be. Technology acquisition is therefore planned over three time horizons:
Vision 5 describes the technologies that we currently have available 'off-the-shelf'. They will be incorporated into new products, such as the aero Trent gas turbine, while some existing engines will be modified to incorporate these proven technologies. Vision5 will ensure that current products remain market leaders in every aspect of performance, reliability and cost.
Vision 10 - the next generation
Vision 10 embodies technologies currently at the validation stage which are due to be commercially available in the medium-term to up to ten years from now. The next generation of our market-leading products will rely largely on Vision10 technologies.
Vision 20 - exploring new ideas
Vision 20 technologies target future generations of products in a 20-year timeframe. These are at the strategic research stage – emerging or as yet unproven – but will ensure that we are prepared for future market developments by focusing our extensive research base (including universities and institutions) on the technology requirements of future generations of products.
Advanced Manufacturing Research Centres
The Axnetwork is comprised of seven Advanced Manufacturing Research Centres helping us and other industrial partners achieve Best in Class capability across our portfolio of manufacturing technologies.
Research and University Technology Centres
We have an established global network of research centres. Each centre addresses a key technology; and collectively they tackle a wide range of engineering disciplines.

The display includes engines from de Havilland and Blackburn, firms that merged with Bristol Siddeley before the final consolidation with in 1966.
The branch works closely with local community and heritage groups, loaning out exhibits and participating in model engineering shows and local festivals, for example. 
The Bristol branch has a Workshop Team, which works on restoration tasks and recent projects include the Bristol Mercury engines for the Bristol Aero Collection's Bolingbroke (Blenheim Mk IV), Gem helicopter engines, a de Havilland Ghost and motorising an 200. Currently the team are working on a Bristol Centaurus sectioned show engine, which has been stripped to component parts, cleaned and repainted or refinished as necessary, and is now beginning the lengthy process of returning it to its former glory.
large archive collection of books, brochures, manuals and other material relating to Bristol and de Havilland engines from 1915 onwards is maintained at the branch by dedicated volunteer archivists. This can be viewed by prior appointment.
President, Paul Craig

Derby and Hucknall branch
Our Derby and Hucknall Branch focuses on the Company and its ancestors, Royce and Company, Royce Limited and Rolls and Company.
Collections and exhibits
Collections and exhibits
The collection in Derby contains over 200 engines, and is arguably one of the largest collections of engines on display in the world. 
These exhibits chronicle not only the story of Rolls-Royce, but that of many of the companies which have become part of the family such as Armstrong-Siddeley and the Bristol Aeroplane Company.
The Heritage Centre on Osmaston Road provides a detailed exhibition of the history of and our successor companies, and provides a comprehensive history of propulsion in relation to aviation, marine and land users of transport.
Of course, whilst a majority of the exhibits relate to aero engines, reflecting a large part of our current history, there are also examples of vehicle, marine, diesel and industrial/power generation engines, rocketry and their engines. The Derby and Hucknall branch exhibition, in combination with items also housed from Coventry and Ansty, and Bristol Branches, is a comprehensive history of propulsion on land, on the sea and in the air.
At the Heritage Centre, there are also workshop facilities for volunteers. Current projects of the Derby and Hucknall Branch include Griffon 58, de Havilland Gnome and a C4 diesel engine.
At Hucknall, there is a smaller collection of engines and models which mainly reflects the work of the former Flight Test Department and other outdoor test activities conducted at Hucknall since 1935.
The Derby and Hucknall branch are custodians of an extensive archive of documents and drawings, which can be accessed by prior appointment.
Visit to all sites and detailed listing of what is on display at both sites can be found on the contacts page.
 (Monday Mornings & Friday Mornings)
Visits to the Heritage Centre are by prior appointment only. To arrange a visit, contact:

strong legacy for a strong future
We started our journey in South Asia over 80 years ago with the powering of India’s first civil and military aircrafts.
Since then, our relationship with India has progressed from a business opportunity market, to licensed production and engineering services, to component manufacturing and supply chain activities.
This is why, we are committed to building on our legacy here and support India’s ambitions to further develop critical industries through partnerships and collaborations with Indian companies.
Key player in the region
Today, we are a key player in the region’s aerospace, marine and energy sectors and we firmly believe in India’s potential to be a centre for innovation and manufacturing.
We have further grown our footprint to include engineering centres, manufacturing joint ventures and regional services centres.

Over the past 60 years, and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) have produced engines together for military applications. Together, we’ve nurtured the capability of Indian aerospace industry.
Today, we are joint venture partners in International Aerospace Manufacturing Private Limited (IAMPL), which manufacture compressor shrouds and cones for our gas turbines for new production and the aftermarket. This facility demonstrates our commitment to the long standing partnership with and the future of Indian aerospace industry.
 is one of the first tier one suppliers in India for civil jet engines, for any major foreign OEM.
Growing a strong supply chain network
The supply chain journey for us in India started with HAL’s forging division for the procurement of Ring Forgings, followed by partnering with for a joint venture for the manufacture of rings, shrouds and cones in the year 2012.
Since then, we have sourced commodities like Precision machining, Fabrications, Rigid Pipes and Brackets. This journey will see us expand into various (Supply Chain Units) SCU’s and other complex commodities over the coming years, helping us meet our customer requirements with the right cost, quality and delivery of our products. This will also help develop manufacturing capabilities of Aero-engine parts in India.
Our other Indian suppliers include Bharat Forge, Godrej & Boyce and (Tata Advance Systems Ltd.). We are also working towards introducing Indian supply chain to more complex commodities and introducing new commodities to the industry.

hub of activity
We have established key manufacturing and supply chain activities across South East Asia
Asia Pacific is one of the fastest growing regions for Rolls-Royce. We have been expanding our manufacturing and supply chain presence to meet demand, bringing us closer to our growing customer base.
Our manufacturing activity supports our growing order book by increasing our global engine production capacity. It is this significant manufacturing presence that drives the need for a strong and competitive regional supply chain.
manufacturing powerhouse in the heart of Asia
Opened in 2012, the Seletar Campus in Singapore significantly increases our engine production capacity and provides us better access to our growing customer base in the region.
The Seletar Campus has provided a “series of firsts” for both Asia and Rolls-Royce. It is the first Trent aero engine assembly and test facility in the region, as well as the first facility outside of the United Kingdom to manufacture our industry-leading hollow titanium wide chord fan blades.
Our strategy is to create a strong, competitive global supply chain to support the growth of our manufacturing activities in the region
With this focus and through our long-standing business relationships, we have helped to build the largest aero engine supply base in Thailand.
Leistritz and Senior Aerospace support the manufacture of compressor blades for Trent engines and Triumph Structures provide the Trent 700 fan case lining. In 2016, Senior Aerospace expanded to include a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Thailand which will give them the necessary capacity to deliver components for our Trent engine as part of a 10 year agreement.
In 2015, we signed a 25 year agreement with aerospace engine component manufacturer Aerospace Sdn. Bhd. to build and assemble fan cases for our Trent 1000 and Trent 7000 aero engines. This landmark partnership supports our world-class, competitive global supply chain, bringing us closer to customers in Asia.
In 2017 delivered their first made in Malaysia Trent 1000 fan case to the Seletar campus in Singapore.
Size of the Seletar Campus, about as big as 6 soccer fields
Number of Trent engines the facility can build in a year
Number of fan blades the Campus can produce per year
Skilled personnel on site, including technicians, engineers, and data scientists
