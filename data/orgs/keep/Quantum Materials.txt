The Dot Initiative is Materials’ commitment to making a sustainable world a reality through innovative technology in solar and battery energy production, energy conservation, better medical diagnostics and treatments, and enabling advances in other fields for mankind’s benefit.
Corp. manufactures Tetrapod Dots for use in medical, display, solar energy and lighting applications through an automated production process. Tetrapod Dot semiconductors enable a new level of engineered performance for consumer and industrial products. QMC's volume manufacturing methods assure economies of scale, reliability and uniformity to drive innovative discovery to commercial success by addressing three critical needs: lowering costs while improving efficiency and quality.
uses our best abilities and knowledge to be the world’s leader in dot technology and markets for the benefit of all stakeholders.  Our objective is to become the first manufacturer of mass produced, high performance dots and other nanofor our partners to integrate into new and better products; and the first solar cell manufacturer to be able to offer a solar electricity solution that competes on a non-subsidized basis with the price of retail electricity in key markets in North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
