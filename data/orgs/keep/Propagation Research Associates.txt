Atmospheric Measurements, Modeling, and Applications
is developing a system that measures distortions on signals of opportunity and      inverts these measurements to determine the state of the atmosphere that caused     the distortions.  This technology is being developed for the mitigation of radar     errors that occur at low elevation operations.  This system will     enable radars to detect and track targets at longer range.  The system involves     solving the stochastic wave equation using real-time estimates of the atmospheric     media.
Precision Positioning and Orientation Technology
is developing technologies for the generation of coded fields that enable compatible     receivers to determine their own location and orientation and that of their targets.     This technology is being developed for guiding smart munitions, significantly reducing the     cost of achieving intercept for low-cost proliferated threats.  In addition, this technology     is being used to track participants in immersive training simulators.
Adaptive Interference Cancellation
is developing an innovative approach to adaptively cancel strong interference. This unique process can be used to mitigate various interference sources including noise jamming, interference, and discrete and distributed clutter.About Us
Associates, Inc., (PRA) is an innovative small          business that is developing technology for commercial and defense          applications.  The company was founded by Dr. Holder and Ms. Dugas in          2001 with the mission to bring products and services of demonstrable          value to its customers in the research, commercial, and defense          communities.  accomplishes this goal through a focused program of          exploiting its capabilities in propagation, state estimation,          radar systems design, and signal processing to develop and manufacture          products that bring new capabilities to its customers.
