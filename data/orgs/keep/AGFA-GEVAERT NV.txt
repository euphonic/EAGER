Agfa in the World
Agfa Specialty Products
The history of Agfa goes back to the nineteenth century and is a long and illustrous record of innovation and technological leadership. Belgian ‘photo products’ business and a German color dye manufacturer joined forces and grew into an internationally renowned company in the graphic and healthcare industries.
1867 – 1904: The Early Years
1867: AGFA, it all began with color
Looking at the high-tech products and solutions delivered by Agfa today, it is hard to believe that it all began way back in the 19th century. But it did. In 1867, a color dye factory was established at the Rummelsburger See near Berlin. In 1873, it was registered as the ‘Aktien-Gesellschaft für Anilin-Fabrikation’, AGFA.
1894: The birth of ‘Gevaert & Cie’
In 1890, the 22-year-old Lieven Gevaert established his own workshop in Antwerp (Belgium), which was mainly used for manufacturing calcium paper for photography. Barely four years later, the businessman Armand Seghers helped to establish the limited stock company ‘Gevaert & Cie’. The starting capital amounted to just 20,000 Belgian francs (500 Euro).
Gevaert & Cie barely had time to celebrate its first anniversary before announcing the establishment of its first subsidiary abroad. The take-over of the Parisian company ‘Blue Star Papers’ introduced a new gelatine paper. This new subsidiary further enhanced the success of Gevaert’s paper line.
1904: The Gevaert business flourishes at the beginning of the new century
Business was booming and the buildings were becoming too small. The factory moved from Antwerp to Mortsel. These premises are still in use today, although the buildings have been substantially extended and modernized. The company’s success was shared with the employees, since they were allowed to participate in the company profits. This initiative established Lieven Gevaert as one of the pioneers of employee participation.
1905 – 1959: The Years of Expansion
1920: The conversion to a new name: ‘Gevaert Photo Producten N.V.’
The success of Gevaert could not be stopped. In 1920, the group was renamed ‘Gevaert Photo Producten N.V.’. While the starting capital in the early years of Gevaert was still moderate, it had now grown to 15 million Belgian francs (375,000 Euro).
1936: Color photography is ready for the mass market
In 1916 Agfa began developing materials for color photography. One of the pioneers was Dr. Rudolf Fischer from Berlin. Agfa was the only company that continued to improve color photography throughout the 1920’s until, in the 1930’s, their efforts finally paid off. In 1936 Agfa introduced ‘Agfacolor-Neu’, a real sensation throughout the whole photographic world. For the first time a single film, single exposure and single developing process sufficed for general color photography. The film had no less than 278 patents! Two years later, Agfa would bring its color paper and a 16mm color-amateur cine film to the market. Agfa was way ahead of most of the competition.
1947: X-rays after World War II
Being also a manufacturer of various types of X-ray films, Gevaert launched a new assortment on the market. These products had higher sensitivity, better contrast, brightness, and wider exposure margins. Once again the medical world enthused over the Gevaert X-ray products.
1952: Films for scientific and technical purposes
Gevaert always put a lot of energy into research, resulting in new technologies and new products. In 1952 it came on the market with a number of innovative, highly successful products. One of them was SCIENTIA, a range of plates and films for scientists, researchers, technicians, etc. This range was used in astronomy, nuclear physics, infrared photography, micrography, etc.
1959: The first fully automatic 35mm camera
Modern amateur photography also means simple, user-friendly handling. Agfa continued to improve its cameras, and focused on very easy to operate equipment. Functionality was another important factor when Agfa came on the market with the first fully automatic 35mm camera. It was an instant success and during the next three years, Agfa sold a million of these Agfa Optima cameras.
1960 – 1981: The Golden 60s and 70s
Not only was it the 125th anniversary of photography, but 1964 was also the year of the big merger between Gevaert and Agfa. In early 1964, Agfa AG, a 100% subsidiary of Bayer merged with Gevaert Photo Producten In doing so, two new operating companies were established on July 1st, and the two partners each held a 50% stake: Gevaert-Agfa in Mortsel (Belgium) and in Leverkusen (Germany).
1971: develops the first European xerographic copier
Agfa introduced a copier at the Hannover Messe in Germany: the ‘Gevafax X-10’ is the first European copier, based on xerographic technology, enabling economic photocopying onto plain paper.
International speculation on the silver market caused a significant rise in the price of silver, which was now seven times more expensive than in the year before! As silver was one of the most important base materials for the photographic industry, these high prices put in a difficult financial situation. Bayer delivered additional funds and consequently obtained 100% ownership of the Group.
1982 – 1998: From Analog to Digital
When new technologies were introduced to the world, the driving force behind many of them was often Agfa. It is the same story with digital technology. As long ago as 1982, had already taken a majority share in the Compugraphic Corporation (USA), which provided state-of-the-art typesetting capabilities at an affordable price. When Agfa acquired the company a few years later, it became the worldwide leader in computer controlled photographic setting machines.
After the acquisition of Hoechst’s printing plate and proofing business in 1996 and DuPont’s Graphic Arts division in 1997, Agfa became the undisputed number 1 in the graphic prepress industry. More than 40% of all printed matter in the world is now produced using Agfa products and systems.
1999: Agfa strengthens its position in the healthcare segment
The acquisition of Sterling Diagnostic Imaging was an integral part of Agfa’s strategic goal to be the leading imaging company through superior products, strong technologies and a worldwide recognized brand name. It allowed Agfa to gain a leading market position in conventional medical imaging in the United States.
1999 – Now: New Era
On June 1, 1999, Agfa reached another milestone in its history. Agfa shares were introduced to the stock markets of Brussels and Frankfurt.
2000 – 2001: The digital (r)evolution continues
The shift towards digital technology is clearly gaining momentum. Agfa has prepared itself for the technology changes and is continuing to follow this growth path for the years to come. Agfa aims to grow in new market segments with its existing portfolio and via strategic acquisitions and alliances. In 2000, Agfa took a majority stake in the Belgian software company Quadrat, which operates in information systems for the radiology department (RIS). One year later, Agfa took a minority interest in MediVision, a developer and manufacturer of digital imaging systems for ophthalmology applications. Also in 2001, Talk Technology, North America’s leading supplier of voice-enabled clinical workflow and reporting solutions for healthcare, became part of Agfa.
2002 – 2005: New developments
In 2002, Agfa acquired Mitra, one of the most important global suppliers of imaging and information management systems for healthcare. In 2005, Agfa became the largest player in Europe in the fast growing market of healthcare solutions through the acquisitions of Symphonie On Line and These companies are leading providers of information systems for hospitals and the electronic patient record, respectively in France and in Germany. Also in 2005, Agfa acquired Heartlab Inc., a leading American designer and supplier of image and information networks for cardiology, and Med2Rad, the leading developer and supplier of information systems for radiology in Italy.
As the only company in the graphic arts industry that offers a complete solution, including automated prepress systems, digital workflow systems, film and plates, Agfa also invested in a new plate production factory in China. Furthermore, the company strengthened its market and technology leadership in the graphic markets by acquiring a number of companies: Autologic, a manufacturer of prepress systems for the newspaper market, Dotrix, a Belgian specialist in digital colour printing solutions for industrial applications, Lastra, an Italian manufacturer of analogue and digital printing plates and ProImage, an Israeli developer of browserbased solutions for digital workflows in printing companies.
In November 2004, Agfa divested all its photographic activities to the new, independent company AgfaPhoto.
2006: Three independent business groups
Since the beginning of 2006, the business groups Graphics and HealthCare are operationally independent. Agfa also created a third group, Materials, around its film manufacturing activities. This group manufactures film and related products on an exclusive basis for Graphics and HealthCare as well as for third parties. It also includes the Agfa Specialty Products department, which supplies a wide variety of film-based products and high-tech solutions to business-to-business customers outside the graphic and healthcare markets.
The independence of the businesses gives each group the necessary flexibility to successfully implement its growth strategy, to strengthen its competitive positioning and to control its costs in line with the changing market conditions.
2007 – 2016: Technological leadership
Agfa Graphics focuses its R&efforts on innovative environment-friendly digital printing solutions and on inkjet. In 2010, the acquisition of Gandi Innovations allowed Agfa Graphics to extend its inkjet portfolio. Also in 2010, the business group consolidated its positions in the Asian and North-American markets through the establishment of the Agfa Graphics Asia joint-venture and the acquisition of the Harold Pitman Company.
Agfa HealthCare continues to improve and extend its imaging solutions and healthcare information solutions, as well as its range of imaging systems. In 2009, the business group added Direct Radiography to its imaging portfolio.  Towards the end of the period, Agfa HealthCare became a frontrunner in enterprise-wide imaging through the launch of its leading Enterprise Imaging platform, which creates a true imaging record for every patient. In 2016, Agfa HealthCare acquired the Group, an Austrian specialist in hospital Business Intelligence. Furthermore, the business group entered the promising Integrated Care market through a strategic alliance with the based My Personal Health Record Express Inc.
In order to compensate for the decline in its traditional film markets, Agfa Specialty Products is focusing on the development of innovative products for promising growth markets, such as synthetic paper, durable materials for the production of cards and conductive organic materials.
After having restored the company’s financial strength in the previous years, management launched several projects to stop the top line erosion and to return to growth in the medium term.

In December 2015, the Board of Directors of the Group decided to cancel the Strips, which were linked to shares issued by The company requested Euroclear to remove the Strips from their registers. These Strips used to give shareholders the right to enjoy lower withholding taxes on dividends. This fiscal advantage disappeared following a decision made by the Belgian authorities at the end of 2012. As a result, these Strips have become without any value or object and are no longer tradable.

Agfa Specialty Products
The history of Agfa goes back to the nineteenth century and is a long and illustrous record of innovation and technological leadership. Belgian ‘photo products’ business and a German color dye manufacturer joined forces and grew into an internationally renowned company in the graphic and healthcare industries.
1867 – 1904: The Early Years
1867: AGFA, it all began with color
Looking at the high-tech products and solutions delivered by Agfa today, it is hard to believe that it all began way back in the 19th century. But it did. In 1867, a color dye factory was established at the Rummelsburger See near Berlin. In 1873, it was registered as the ‘Aktien-Gesellschaft für Anilin-Fabrikation’, AGFA.
1894: The birth of ‘Gevaert & Cie’
In 1890, the 22-year-old Lieven Gevaert established his own workshop in Antwerp (Belgium), which was mainly used for manufacturing calcium paper for photography. Barely four years later, the businessman Armand Seghers helped to establish the limited stock company ‘Gevaert & Cie’. The starting capital amounted to just 20,000 Belgian francs (500 Euro).
Gevaert & Cie barely had time to celebrate its first anniversary before announcing the establishment of its first subsidiary abroad. The take-over of the Parisian company ‘Blue Star Papers’ introduced a new gelatine paper. This new subsidiary further enhanced the success of Gevaert’s paper line.
1904: The Gevaert business flourishes at the beginning of the new century
Business was booming and the buildings were becoming too small. The factory moved from Antwerp to Mortsel. These premises are still in use today, although the buildings have been substantially extended and modernized. The company’s success was shared with the employees, since they were allowed to participate in the company profits. This initiative established Lieven Gevaert as one of the pioneers of employee participation.
1905 – 1959: The Years of Expansion
1920: The conversion to a new name: ‘Gevaert Photo Producten N.V.’
The success of Gevaert could not be stopped. In 1920, the group was renamed ‘Gevaert Photo Producten N.V.’. While the starting capital in the early years of Gevaert was still moderate, it had now grown to 15 million Belgian francs (375,000 Euro).
1936: Color photography is ready for the mass market
In 1916 Agfa began developing materials for color photography. One of the pioneers was Dr. Rudolf Fischer from Berlin. Agfa was the only company that continued to improve color photography throughout the 1920’s until, in the 1930’s, their efforts finally paid off. In 1936 Agfa introduced ‘Agfacolor-Neu’, a real sensation throughout the whole photographic world. For the first time a single film, single exposure and single developing process sufficed for general color photography. The film had no less than 278 patents! Two years later, Agfa would bring its color paper and a 16mm color-amateur cine film to the market. Agfa was way ahead of most of the competition.
1947: X-rays after World War II
Being also a manufacturer of various types of X-ray films, Gevaert launched a new assortment on the market. These products had higher sensitivity, better contrast, brightness, and wider exposure margins. Once again the medical world enthused over the Gevaert X-ray products.
1952: Films for scientific and technical purposes
Gevaert always put a lot of energy into research, resulting in new technologies and new products. In 1952 it came on the market with a number of innovative, highly successful products. One of them was SCIENTIA, a range of plates and films for scientists, researchers, technicians, etc. This range was used in astronomy, nuclear physics, infrared photography, micrography, etc.
1959: The first fully automatic 35mm camera
Modern amateur photography also means simple, user-friendly handling. Agfa continued to improve its cameras, and focused on very easy to operate equipment. Functionality was another important factor when Agfa came on the market with the first fully automatic 35mm camera. It was an instant success and during the next three years, Agfa sold a million of these Agfa Optima cameras.
1960 – 1981: The Golden 60s and 70s
Not only was it the 125th anniversary of photography, but 1964 was also the year of the big merger between Gevaert and Agfa. In early 1964, Agfa AG, a 100% subsidiary of Bayer merged with Gevaert Photo Producten In doing so, two new operating companies were established on July 1st, and the two partners each held a 50% stake: Gevaert-Agfa in Mortsel (Belgium) and in Leverkusen (Germany).
1971: develops the first European xerographic copier
Agfa introduced a copier at the Hannover Messe in Germany: the ‘Gevafax X-10’ is the first European copier, based on xerographic technology, enabling economic photocopying onto plain paper.
International speculation on the silver market caused a significant rise in the price of silver, which was now seven times more expensive than in the year before! As silver was one of the most important base materials for the photographic industry, these high prices put in a difficult financial situation. Bayer delivered additional funds and consequently obtained 100% ownership of the Group.
1982 – 1998: From Analog to Digital
When new technologies were introduced to the world, the driving force behind many of them was often Agfa. It is the same story with digital technology. As long ago as 1982, had already taken a majority share in the Compugraphic Corporation (USA), which provided state-of-the-art typesetting capabilities at an affordable price. When Agfa acquired the company a few years later, it became the worldwide leader in computer controlled photographic setting machines.
After the acquisition of Hoechst’s printing plate and proofing business in 1996 and DuPont’s Graphic Arts division in 1997, Agfa became the undisputed number 1 in the graphic prepress industry. More than 40% of all printed matter in the world is now produced using Agfa products and systems.
1999: Agfa strengthens its position in the healthcare segment
The acquisition of Sterling Diagnostic Imaging was an integral part of Agfa’s strategic goal to be the leading imaging company through superior products, strong technologies and a worldwide recognized brand name. It allowed Agfa to gain a leading market position in conventional medical imaging in the United States.
1999 – Now: New Era
On June 1, 1999, Agfa reached another milestone in its history. Agfa shares were introduced to the stock markets of Brussels and Frankfurt.
2000 – 2001: The digital (r)evolution continues
The shift towards digital technology is clearly gaining momentum. Agfa has prepared itself for the technology changes and is continuing to follow this growth path for the years to come. Agfa aims to grow in new market segments with its existing portfolio and via strategic acquisitions and alliances. In 2000, Agfa took a majority stake in the Belgian software company Quadrat, which operates in information systems for the radiology department (RIS). One year later, Agfa took a minority interest in MediVision, a developer and manufacturer of digital imaging systems for ophthalmology applications. Also in 2001, Talk Technology, North America’s leading supplier of voice-enabled clinical workflow and reporting solutions for healthcare, became part of Agfa.
2002 – 2005: New developments
In 2002, Agfa acquired Mitra, one of the most important global suppliers of imaging and information management systems for healthcare. In 2005, Agfa became the largest player in Europe in the fast growing market of healthcare solutions through the acquisitions of Symphonie On Line and These companies are leading providers of information systems for hospitals and the electronic patient record, respectively in France and in Germany. Also in 2005, Agfa acquired Heartlab Inc., a leading American designer and supplier of image and information networks for cardiology, and Med2Rad, the leading developer and supplier of information systems for radiology in Italy.
As the only company in the graphic arts industry that offers a complete solution, including automated prepress systems, digital workflow systems, film and plates, Agfa also invested in a new plate production factory in China. Furthermore, the company strengthened its market and technology leadership in the graphic markets by acquiring a number of companies: Autologic, a manufacturer of prepress systems for the newspaper market, Dotrix, a Belgian specialist in digital colour printing solutions for industrial applications, Lastra, an Italian manufacturer of analogue and digital printing plates and ProImage, an Israeli developer of browserbased solutions for digital workflows in printing companies.
In November 2004, Agfa divested all its photographic activities to the new, independent company AgfaPhoto.
2006: Three independent business groups
Since the beginning of 2006, the business groups Graphics and HealthCare are operationally independent. Agfa also created a third group, Materials, around its film manufacturing activities. This group manufactures film and related products on an exclusive basis for Graphics and HealthCare as well as for third parties. It also includes the Agfa Specialty Products department, which supplies a wide variety of film-based products and high-tech solutions to business-to-business customers outside the graphic and healthcare markets.
The independence of the businesses gives each group the necessary flexibility to successfully implement its growth strategy, to strengthen its competitive positioning and to control its costs in line with the changing market conditions.
2007 – 2016: Technological leadership
Agfa Graphics focuses its R&efforts on innovative environment-friendly digital printing solutions and on inkjet. In 2010, the acquisition of Gandi Innovations allowed Agfa Graphics to extend its inkjet portfolio. Also in 2010, the business group consolidated its positions in the Asian and North-American markets through the establishment of the Agfa Graphics Asia joint-venture and the acquisition of the Harold Pitman Company.
Agfa HealthCare continues to improve and extend its imaging solutions and healthcare information solutions, as well as its range of imaging systems. In 2009, the business group added Direct Radiography to its imaging portfolio.  Towards the end of the period, Agfa HealthCare became a frontrunner in enterprise-wide imaging through the launch of its leading Enterprise Imaging platform, which creates a true imaging record for every patient. In 2016, Agfa HealthCare acquired the Group, an Austrian specialist in hospital Business Intelligence. Furthermore, the business group entered the promising Integrated Care market through a strategic alliance with the based My Personal Health Record Express Inc.
In order to compensate for the decline in its traditional film markets, Agfa Specialty Products is focusing on the development of innovative products for promising growth markets, such as synthetic paper, durable materials for the production of cards and conductive organic materials.
After having restored the company’s financial strength in the previous years, management launched several projects to stop the top line erosion and to return to growth in the medium term.

Agfa announces a study aiming at focused growth
(Agfa) today announced that the Board of Directors has asked the Management to study how to organise the HealthCare activities into a stand-alone legal entity structure and organisation within the Group.
Agfa kondigt een studie aan met het oog op doelgerichte groei
publishes its second quarter 2017 results – regulated information
Excluding the expected impact of the reorganization of the hardcopy distribution channels in China, we have delivered a decent set of results. The fundamentals of our business are intact. Most of our growth engines performed well and Agfa HealthCare’s order book for its solutions is well-filled. Our costs are under control and we stick to our ambition to keep the recurring margin around 10% of revenue on average in the years to come. The decision to reorganize Agfa HealthCare’s hardcopy distribution in China was taken to strengthen our position in this healthy market and to improve the efficiency of our supply chain. These actions are part of our growth program, which includes a project aimed at resisting the decline of our traditional businesses. After a year of transition in 2017, our hardcopy business should normalize in 2018.
Based on the specificity of Agfa HealthCare’s portfolio, the Board of Directors requested the management to study how to organize the HealthCare activities into a stand-alone legal entity structure and organization within the Group. This study should lead to a better position for all parts of the Group to pursue growth,” said Christian Reinaudo, President and of the Group.

“Wanneer we geen rekening houden met de verwachte impact van de reorganisatie van de distributiekanalen voor hardcopy in China, hebben we een degelijke prestatie geleverd. De fundamenten van onze activiteiten blijven intact. De meeste van onze groeimotoren presteerden goed en het orderboek voor Agfa HealthCare’s IT-oplossingen is goed gevuld. Onze kosten zijn onder controle en we blijven bij onze ambitie om de komende jaren gemiddeld een recurrente EBITDA-marge van om en bij de 10% van de omzet af te leveren. De beslissing om Agfa HealthCare’s hardcopy-distributie in China te reorganiseren is genomen om onze positie in deze gezonde markt te versterken en om de efficiëntie van onze supply chain te verbeteren. Deze acties maken deel uit van ons groeiprogramma, dat onder meer gericht is op het bieden van weerstand aan de achteruitgang van onze traditionele activiteiten. Na het overgangsjaar 2017 zou onze hardcopy-business in 2018 moeten normaliseren.

Your ideas are valuable!
Agfa welcomes your ideas and is eager to support you in the further development of your idea. However, there are some guidelines and rules that have to be followed while introducing your idea to Agfa. In that way, we can consider each ‘invention’ thoroughly and objectively. If the rules sound strict, it is because we are trying not to mislead you. We want to protect your interests as well as ours. In no way, these rules are meant to put you off. Only the entries that apply to these rules will be withheld, so please check them thoroughly. You will find the necessary steps for submitting your idea in the submission procedure. We congratulate you with your creativity, and thank you for associating Agfa with new, imaginative ideas! Good luck!
Once you have passed the following guidelines, please follow our submission procedure for presenting your idea.
The origin of the idea
You must assure us in good conscience that you are the one who originated the idea. You also need the legal right to negotiate that idea with Agfa.
The claims to the idea
We will only consider your idea after all the owners have submitted it. Their names and the nature of their interests must be known to Agfa. If your employer has any rights to your idea, we need a written statement from him/her that enables you to continue the procedure.
If you are younger than 18, your parents or guardian must sign the Non-Confidential Idea Submission Agreement.
Neither are we given any rights under a patent, which you already have or may obtain in the future, if you submit your idea to us.
Patent attorney
We advise you to consult a patent attorney before submitting any information concerning your idea to Agfa. He can help you to define if your idea can be patented. He can also assist you on other levels, e.g. the commercial possibilities of your idea or the right a patent gives you against other parties. Agfa does not assume any obligation to consult you on these matters.
The confidentiality of your idea
The general description of your idea in the Non-Confidential Idea Submission Agreement should not include anything you deem proprietary or confidential. Agfa assumes no confidential relationship with you when you sign and send in that Agreement, neither does Agfa agree to maintain the idea in confidence.
Mere disclosure of your idea to an Agfa officer or employee cannot establish any obligation of confidence or other restriction on Agfa. Please, bear this in mind in the preliminary discussions with our employees. They are not authorized to accept information on a confidential or restricted basis.
You are free to submit your idea to other companies without informing us. However, we request that you do not disclose that Agfa is considering your idea.
After submitting…
Once we have studied your idea in detail, we will let you know in writing whether we are interested in further correspondence. We assume no obligation to tell you something we already knew or have discovered since you submitted your idea.
The submission of an idea proceeds through several stages. Those stages represent a fair balance between your interests and rights and those of Agfa. The procedure applies worldwide and cannot be modified or waived.
Stage 1: the preliminary stage
Agfa will normally be interested in considering your idea if:
Agfa has an interest in the major market where your idea can be applied
Your idea has culminated beyond the stage of a mere idea
Your idea does not concern sales promotion or marketing ideas
Your idea does not reflect an already existing Agfa product
The product, process, device or formula you thought of does not already exist
Agfa can be interested in your idea if:
Your idea’s end use falls inside the following major markets where Agfa currently sells products: graphic systems, medical imaging, digital printing, inkjet printing and inks, software for imaging applications, optics, synthetic paper, printed electronics, nanoparticles, conductive inks.
Your idea is more than a mere concept for a new product that you have not yet put into practice. Your creative effort must already have culminated in a working device, product, process or formula.
Your idea has nothing to do with sales promotion or marketing ideas.
Your idea does not reflect the use for any of Agfa’s existing products. We rely on our own scientists, engineers and marketing analysts for this.
Your idea does not represent an already existing product, process, working device or formula. Such ideas are, for example, already shown or described in someone else’s patent, catalogue, magazine, encyclopedia or printed publication. Or it is already known to the public, a trade or Agfa.
Stage 2: for patented ideas
If you have applied for a patent but it has not yet been granted, we kindly ask you to follow the procedure for the non-patented ideas. Attention: a pattent application is not a granted patent.
Agfa prefers to welcome ideas or inventions that are covered by a patent or copyright. This gives us a better understanding of what your idea is and how you have defined it. It also significantly increases the possibility that products embodying your idea will be protected against competition.
If you have a granted patent covering your invention, and the idea is consistent with our basic rules, just send a copy of it to N.V., Septestraat 27, B-2640 Mortsel, Belgium att. to Mr. Luc Vanmaele, MTC, Manager Technology Scouting. Fax: +32 (0)3 444 3347.
No other steps are required. Agfa will notify you in writing within six weeks whether we are interested in your patented idea.
And once again, we thank you for letting us in on your inventive ideas!
Stage 2: for non-patented ideas
Please be aware that non-confidential disclosure of any inventive part of your idea to outsiders (such as Agfa) prior to patent filing is likely to destroy your patent rights in most countries of the world. So, we strongly recommend that, before you present your idea to us, you consult a patent attorney for professional advice. The costs involved in obtaining such advice are your sole responsibility.
If you want to send us your non-patented idea, you must complete a Non-Confidential Idea Submission Agreement and a Questionnaire. This way, without revealing confidential information, you summarize your idea and answer some basic questions regarding its commercial prospect.
To submit your idea, please print this  pdf-form  
 , fill it out and send it by e-mail, mail or fax to:
Septestraat 27
Agfa can retain whatever material you submit to us for assessment. In order to be certain that your files and ours correspond, we advise you to keep a duplicate copy of everything you send to us. If you have more than one idea, each should be accompanied by a separate Non-Confidential Idea Submission Agreement.
Do not include any attachments (such as your sales brochure, in case you are already selling a product embodying your idea), as that may mislead us while evaluating your idea. If you are in doubt about what you should tell us, please consult your patent attorney.
Stage 3: Agfa’s internal evaluation of your idea
We will not conduct any evaluations or negotiations before we receive your granted patent or the signed Non-Confidential Idea Submission Agreement.
Once you have sent us the Submission Agreement or a copy of your patent, your idea will be assessed at Agfa by researchers, marketing people, and one or more managers of our business units. If we think that there is a chance that we will purchase or license the idea, we may also ask the opinion from our patent attorneys on the potential strength of your patent rights.
We will try to inform you in writing within six weeks, whether we are interested in your idea. Please appreciate however, that some ideas take extra time to evaluate. If, after our assessment, we are still interested in your idea, we may wish to enter into a formal written contract with you. This contract may, among other things, grant patent rights to Agfa and provide compensation to you.

has a long tradition of good citizenship. As a company we strive for profitable growth, but at the same time attach great value to the impact our activities have on the environment, to the health and safety of our employees and to the relations with all of our stakeholders.
We consider Corporate Governance to be an important tool to improve constantly and systematically the way our company is managed and the way our company looks after the interest of shareholders and stakeholders. We are conscious of the fact that the way companies operate in today’s society is undergoing profound changes to which we should respond.
From the date of our listing on the Euronext Brussels stock exchange in June 1999, has paid great attention to transparent policies that determine the governance of the company. Most of Agfa-Gevaert’s existing policies were already in conformity with the Belgian Code on Corporate Governance for stock quoted companies as it was issued at the end of 2004. In conformity with the provisions of the Belgian Corporate Governance Code (“Code 2009”), the Corporate Governance Charter is updated as often as needed to reflect the company’s corporate governance at any time. Moreover, the Agfa Board regularly conducts a comprehensive review of the Corporate Governance Charter, to assess whether it still is aligned with the latest principles, provisions and guidelines on Corporate Governance.
You find our Corporate Governance Charter available in this section of our company’s website. We invite you to become acquainted with its content. Your feedback on our Corporate Governance Charter is much appreciated.

publishes its third quarter 2018 results – Regulated information
today announced its third quarter 2018 results.
·         Top line decline of 4.8%, excluding currency effects and the impact of portfolio rationalizations
·         Strong performance of Inkjet, HealthCare Information Solutions and certain Specialty Products ranges
·         Recurring at 35 million Euro
·         Net loss at minus 5 million Euro
·         Net financial debt at 99 million Euro
“During this quarter, we continued to make excellent progress with the reorganization of our HealthCare activities into a stand-alone legal entity structure within the Group. The technical part of this complex exercise is almost behind us. We have also been focusing on clarifying the strategies of the future HealthCare company, as well as of the other activities of the Group. As already stated before, we aim at playing an important role in the consolidation of the offset industry. This strategy has translated into concrete actions in the past quarter. We entered into an alliance with the Chinese Lucky HuaGuang Graphics Co. Ltd., which will have far-reaching consequences for our business and for the prepress industry. Furthermore, we announced our intention to acquire the prepress business of the Spanish Ipagsa company. Finally, in order to optimize production capacity, we recently announced the intended closure of our printing plate factory in Branchburg.
am confident that when the project is completed, two companies will emerge that will have the power and the means to pursue growth in the years to come. We will give more information on how we see the companies’ structures and strategies when we report on our full year results.
The strong third quarter performance of most of our growth engines was snowed under by the top line decrease of most of our traditional businesses. As expected, the top line of Agfa Graphics’ prepress business was impacted by the product portfolio reorganization. In Agfa HealthCare, the hardcopy business temporarily slowed down following a marked recovery in the first half of the year. However, we are confident that this business will pick up again in the coming quarters.
Our full year recurring margin will be around 8% of revenue. Mainly based on our current actions in the field of the prepress and HealthCare businesses, we stick to our ambition to target a recurring margin of around 10% of revenue on average in the years to come,” said Christian Reinaudo, President and of the Group.
Group – third quarter 2018
The Group’s top line evolution was strongly impacted by the product portfolio reorganization in the Agfa Graphics business group’s prepress business.
Excluding portfolio rationalizations and currency effects, the Group’s revenue decline amounted to 4.8%. Several growth engines – including Agfa Graphics’ inkjet business, Agfa HealthCare’s HealthCare Information Solutions and several activities of Agfa Specialty Products – posted strong topline growth.
Mainly due to high aluminum prices and adverse product/mix effects, the Group’s gross profit margin decreased to 31.8% of revenue.
As a percentage of revenue, Selling and General Administration expenses increased to 21.4% of revenue.
R&expenses amounted to 32 million Euro, or 6.0% of revenue.
Recurring reached 6.5% of revenue, versus 9.0% in the third quarter of 2017. Recurring reached 4.0% of revenue.
Partly due to costs related to the transformation of the Company, restructuring and non-recurring items resulted in an expense of 15 million Euro, versus an expense of 9 million Euro in the previous year.
The net finance costs increased from 8 million Euro in the third quarter of 2017 to 11 million Euro.
Income tax expenses decreased to 0 million Euro.
Financial position and cash flow
At the end of the third quarter of 2018, total assets were 2,348 million Euro, compared to 2,233 million Euro at the end of 2017.
Trade working capital moved from 644 million Euro (26% of sales) at the end of 2017 to 653 million Euro (29% of sales) at the end of the third quarter of 2018.
Net financial debt amounted to 99 million Euro, versus 18 million Euro at the end of 2017.
Excluding the effects of the decision to discontinue certain prepress-related reseller activities in the United States and currency effects, Agfa Graphics’ top line decreased by 3.8%, which is markedly better than in the previous quarters of the year.
The main driver behind this positive evolution is the Inkjet segment, which grew its top line by over 9% based on the success of the recently released Jeti printers and on the good performance of the ink range.
On top of the portfolio reorganization, the prepress segment’s top line was impacted by the strong market-driven decline for analog computer-to-film products and by the pressure on volume for the digital computer-to-plate product offerings. The price pressure in this segment is now under control due to the recently announced global price increase program for printing plates. In recent months, important strategic steps have been taken which should help to restore the prepress segment’s top line.
 Mainly due to the high aluminum price and adverse product and regional mix effects, Agfa Graphics’ gross profit margin decreased from 27.6% of revenue in the third quarter of 2017 to 25.6%. Recurring amounted to 7.9 million Euro (3.1% of revenue), versus 14.2 million Euro (5.0% of revenue) in the third quarter of 2017 and recurring reached 2.2 million Euro (0.9% of revenue), versus 8.2 million Euro (2.9% of revenue).
In the third quarter, Agfa Graphics took two major steps in its strategy to actively participate in the consolidation of the prepress industry. Firstly, the business group entered into a strategic alliance with Lucky HuaGuang Graphics Co. Ltd. The alliance should allow both companies to grow their businesses by optimizing their respective strengths in manufacturing, technology and distribution of prepress products and services. Secondly, Agfa Graphics announced its intention to acquire the prepress business of the privately-owned Spanish printing plate supplier Ipagsa Industrial S.L.
Also in the field of prepress, Agfa Graphics launched Avatar V-ZH, the first chemistry-free violet printing plate for newspaper printing that does not require pre-heating. Furthermore, Agfa Graphics released several new software solutions. The intelligent InkTune and PressTune tools offer print houses complete control over all printing elements, from ink use to compliance with ISO, G7 and client-specific standards, while also reducing production costs. Apogee v11 is the newest version of the business group’s workflow software for commercial printers. Apogee v11 takes print production to the next level by automating all prepress tasks.
In the field of inkjet, Agfa Graphics presented its new flagship Jeti Tauro H3300 inkjet printer to over 300 print professionals at an exclusive Red Carpet Event in June. Following the event, the business group booked multiple orders in the third quarter, mainly for the Jeti Tauro H2500 and the Jeti Tauro H3300 printers. In Belgium, for instance, the ReclameOnline.be/Publi-company invested in two print engines from Agfa Graphics: a Jeti Tauro HS2500 and an Anapurna 3200i.
In August, Agfa Graphics also won four prestigious Product of the Year awards from the Specialty Graphic Imaging Association (SGIA). The award-winning products are the brand-new Jeti Tauro H3300 printer, the Jeti Mira printer (winner in two categories) and the Anapurna H3200i printer.
Excluding currency effects, Agfa HealthCare’s revenue decreased by 6.0%. Following a recovery in the first six months of the year, sales for the Imaging segment’s hardcopy business slowed down in the third quarter due to certain late effects of the reorganization of the distribution channels in China. The hardcopy business is expected to pick up again in the coming quarters.
The segment performed well, with the HealthCare Information Solutions range reporting double-digit top line growth and continuously strong order book growth. Overall, the Imaging Solutions range performed according to expectations, with good performances in most major geographies and a slowdown in the USA.
Mainly due to adverse product/mix effects in the Imaging segment and the above mentioned late effects of the reorganization of the hardcopy distribution channels, Agfa HealthCare’s gross profit margin evolved from 40.7% of revenue in the third quarter of 2017 to 40.0%. Recurring decreased from 35.7 million Euro (13.8% of revenue) in the third quarter of 2017 to 24.4 million Euro (10.3% of revenue). Recurring reached 17.6 million Euro (7.4% of revenue), versus 29.5 million Euro (11.4% of revenue) in the previous year.
In the field of Imaging, Agfa HealthCare announced its new Workstation. This ‘nerve center’ of the imaging environment offers a single, intuitive interface for smooth and efficient general radiography, fluoroscopy, mammography and full leg/full spine imaging. Built on mature and proven technologies and incorporating customer-driven innovations, it facilitates flexibility and customization.
In the USA, Florida Hospital, part of the Adventist Health System, decided to install Agfa HealthCare’s versatile 800 Multi-Purpose Direct Radiography solution at three facilities.
In the field of Imaging Solutions, the Performance Report 2018 identifies Agfa HealthCare as a strong and guiding partner for health systems rolling out enterprise imaging. is a research and insights firm aiming at improving healthcare delivery. Its reports are based on feedback from healthcare organizations and clinicians.
Also in Imaging Solutions, Agfa HealthCare announced the successful go-live of its Enterprise Imaging for Radiology suite at the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow (Essex, UK). The hospital is part of the Princess Alexandra Hospital Trust. Furthermore, the business group announced that the first phase of the implementation of Home Reporting as part of the Enterprise Imaging agreement with Alliance Medical Ireland has been successfully completed. The solution offers radiologists a variety of Remote Reporting configurations, matching their different requirements. For instance, radiologists can do their work at home with the same user experience as on-site.
Agfa Specialty Products – third quarter 2018
Agfa Specialty Products’ top line decreased by 9.1% to 45 million Euro, mainly due to normal fluctuations in the contract business and the effect of the lower silver price.
Synaps Synthetic Paper and the Specialty Chemicals business (including Orgacon Electronic Materials) performed well.

1) During 2018, the Group has consistently applied its accounting policies used in previous year, except for the presentation of the balance sheet that has changed resulting from the application of the new IFRS-standard 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’. The Group has adopted 15 using the cumulative effect method, with the effect of initially applying this standard recognized at the date of initial application, i.e. January 1, 2018. As a result, the Group will not apply the requirements of 15 to the comparative period presented.
The new standard has introduced the concept of contract assets and contract liabilities. At December 31, 2017 these assets and liabilities were included in other captions of the balance sheet. At January 1, 2018 recognized not billed revenue amounting to 84 million Euro, previously comprised in trade receivables, has been reclassified to contract assets. Reclassifications from inventory to contract assets amounted to 11 million Euro and mainly comprised work in progress. The reclassification from other assets to contract assets amounted to 10 million Euro and related to contracts with a third party that provides supporting services enabling the Group to deliver maintenance services to the customers.
On the liability side, contract liabilities at 1 January 2018 comprised ‘Deferred revenue and advance payments received from customers’ amounting to 128 million Euro, previously presented separately on the face of the balance sheet and bonuses and rebates related to goods and service purchased by customers during the period. The latter amounted to 17 million Euro and was previously presented as part of trade-related provisions.
Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (in million Euro) Unaudited, consolidated figures following accounting policies.
1) During 2018, the Group has changed the presentation of the Consolidated statement of cash flows by separating following non‐cash expenses: write‐downs on inventories, impairment losses on receivables, additions and reversals of provisions and accrued expenses for personnel commitments and defined benefit plans and similar plans. These other non‐cash expenses were previously reflected in ‘Changes in Trade Working Capital’ and ‘Changes in Provisions’. By this new presentation, management believes to provide more relevant information to the users of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, the Group has restated the comparative period presented.
2) During 2018, the Group has consistently applied its accounting policies used in previous year, except for the presentation of the consolidated statement of financial position and the consolidated statement of cash flows that both have changed resulting from the application of the new IFRS‐standard 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’. The Group has adopted 15 using the cumulative effect method, with the effect of initially applying this standard recognized at the date of initial application, i.e. January 1, 2018. As a result, the Group will not apply the requirements of 15 to the comparative period presented. Due to the changes in IFRS15, the cashflows on the different line items of the Trade Working Capital are not comparable with 2017 as the cash from / (used in) contract assets and contract liabilities for 2017 were reflected in the line items ‘Changes in inventories’, ‘Changes in trade receivables’ and ‘Changes in other working capital’. More information is provided in footnote (1) to the Consolidated statement of financial position.

Agfa Graphics intends to close offset printing plate factory in Branchburg, New Jersey, USA
Today, Agfa Graphics announced that it intends to close its factory in Branchburg (New Jersey, USA) – one of its six production sites for printing plates worldwide. This plant produces lithographic aluminum printing plates for offset presses. In recent years, market demand for these products has slightly decreased in Europe and the In other regions, such as Asia, demand increased.

We are committed to minimizing the social impact of this closure as much as possible. Furthermore, this decision will have no impact on our high standards of delivery of our goods and services to our customers in North America”.

publiceert resultaten voor het derde kwartaal van 2018 – Gereglementeerde informatie
publiceerde vandaag zijn resultaten voor het derde kwartaal van 2018.
·         Omzetdaling van 4,8% exclusief wisselkoerseffecten en de impact van portfoliorationalisaties
·         Sterke prestaties van Inkjet, HealthCare Information Solutions en bepaalde activiteiten van Specialty Products
·         Recurrente van 35 miljoen euro
·         Nettoverlies van min 5 miljoen euro
·         Netto financiële schuld van 99 miljoen euro
“Tijdens dit kwartaal boekten we opnieuw uitstekende vooruitgang met de reorganisatie van onze HealthCare IT-activiteiten in een zelfstandige vennootschapsstructuur binnen de Groep. Het technische gedeelte van deze complexe oefening ligt nu bijna achter ons. We concentreerden ons eveneens op het verduidelijken van de strategieën van de toekomstige HealthCare IT-onderneming en van de andere activiteiten van de Groep. Zoals eerder al gezegd, willen we een belangrijke rol spelen in de consolidatie van de offsetindustrie. Het voorbije kwartaal werd deze strategie vertaald in concrete acties. We gingen een alliantie aan met het Chinese Lucky HuaGuang Graphics Co. Ltd. Deze alliantie zal verregaande gevolgen hebben voor onze business en voor de drukvoorbereidingsindustrie. Voorts kondigden we de intentie aan om de drukvoorbereidingsactiviteiten van het Spaanse bedrijf Ipagsa over te nemen. Met het oog op de optimalisatie van de productiecapaciteit kondigden we tot slot de beoogde sluiting van onze drukplatenfabriek in Branchburg aan.
Ik ben ervan overtuigd dat we na de afronding van het project twee ondernemingen zullen hebben met de kracht en de middelen om de komende jaren groei na te streven. We zullen bij de publicatie van de jaarresultaten meer informatie geven over hoe de structuren en de strategieën van deze twee bedrijven er zullen uitzien.
De sterke kwartaalprestaties van de meeste van onze groeimotoren werden ondergesneeuwd door de omzetdaling van het merendeel van de traditionele activiteiten. Zoals verwacht werd de omzet van de drukvoorbereidingsbusiness van Agfa Graphics beïnvloed door de productportfoliorationalisatie. Binnen Agfa HealthCare kende de hardcopy business na het duidelijke herstel in de eerste helft van het jaar een tijdelijke vertraging. We hebben er echter vertrouwen in dat deze business in de loop van de volgende kwartalen opnieuw zal aantrekken.
De recurrente EBITDA-marge voor het volledige jaar zal ongeveer op 8% van de omzet uitkomen. Vooral op basis van onze huidige acties op het vlak van de drukvoorbereidings- en HealthCare IT-activiteiten blijven we echter bij onze ambitie om de komende jaren gemiddeld een recurrente EBITDA-marge van om en bij de 10% van de omzet na te streven,” zei Christian Reinaudo, President en van de Groep.
Groep – derde kwartaal van 2018
De omzetevolutie van de Groep werd sterk beïnvloed door de reorganisatie van de productportfolio van Agfa Graphics’ drukvoorbereidings-activiteiten. Zonder de impact van portfoliorationalisaties en zonder wisselkoerseffecten, zou de omzetdaling van de Groep 4,8% bedragen. Verscheidene groeimotoren – waaronder Agfa Graphics’ inkjetactiviteiten, Agfa HealthCare’s HealthCare Information Solutions en bepaalde activiteiten van Agfa Specialty Products – boekten een sterke omzetgroei.
 De recurrente kwam uit op 6,5% van de omzet, tegenover 9,0% in het derde kwartaal van 2017. De recurrente bereikte 4,0% van de omzet.
 Deels door kosten i.v.m. de transformatie van de onderneming, kwamen de reorganisatiekosten en niet-recurrente resultaten uit op een kost van
 De nettofinancieringskosten stegen van 8 miljoen euro in het derde kwartaal van 2017 tot 11 miljoen euro.

Zonder de impact van de beslissing om bepaalde drukvoorbereidingsgerelateerde reseller-activiteiten in de stop te zetten en zonder wisselkoerseffecten, daalde de omzet van Agfa Graphics met 3,8%. Dat is een duidelijke verbetering tegenover de vorige kwartalen van dit jaar.
De voornaamste drijvende kracht achter deze positieve evolutie is het inkjetsegment, waarvan de omzet op basis van het succes van de recent geïntroduceerde Jeti-printers en van de goede prestatie van het inktgamma met meer dan 9% groeide.
Bovenop de portfolioreorganisatie, werd de omzet van het drukvoorbereiding-segment beïnvloed door de sterke marktgedreven achteruitgang voor analoge computer-to-film-producten en door de druk op de volumes voor het digitale computer-to-plate-productaanbod. De prijsdruk in dit segment is nu onder controle dankzij de recent aangekondigde wereldwijde prijsverhogingen voor drukplaten. De laatste maanden werden belangrijke strategische beslissingen genomen die zouden moeten bijdragen aan het herstel van de omzet van het drukvoorbereidingsegment.
In het derde kwartaal nam Agfa Graphics twee belangrijke beslissingen met betrekking tot zijn strategie om actief deel te nemen in de consolidatie van de drukvoorbereidingsindustrie. Ten eerste ging de businessgroep een strategische alliantie aan met Lucky HuaGuang Graphics Co. Ltd. De alliantie moet beide ondernemingen in staat te stellen om groei te realiseren door de optimalisatie van hun respectieve sterke punten op het vlak van productie, technologie en distributie van grafische drukvoorbereidingsproducten en -diensten. Ten tweede kondigde Agfa Graphics aan dat het van plan is de drukvoorbereidingsactiviteiten van de Spaanse drukplatenleverancier Ipagsa Industrial over te nemen.
Nog op het vlak van drukvoorbereiding introduceerde Agfa Graphics Avatar V-ZH, de eerste chemievrije violette drukplaat voor krantendruk die geen voorverwarming nodig heeft. Voorts introduceerde Agfa Graphics verscheidene nieuwe softwareoplossingen. De intelligente InkTune- en PressTune-systemen geven drukkerijen de volledige controle over alle elementen van het drukproces, van het inktverbruik tot het voldoen aan ISO-, G7- en klantspecifieke normen. Voorts helpen ze om de productiekosten te drukken. Apogee v11 is de nieuwste versie van Agfa Graphics’ workflowsoftware voor commerciële drukkerijen. Door alle drukvoorbereidingstaken te automatiseren tilt Apogee v11 drukwerkproductie naar een hoger niveau.
Op het vlak van inkjet presenteerde Agfa Graphics in juni het nieuwe paradepaardje onder de inkjetprinters – de Jeti Tauro H3300 – aan meer dan 300 professionals uit de drukindustrie tijdens een exclusief Red Carpet Event. Na het evenement boekte de businessgroep verscheidene bestellingen in het derde kwartaal, vooral voor de Jeti Tauro H2500 en de Jeti Tauro H3300 Zo investeerde het Belgische bedrijf ReclameOnline.be/Publi-in twee drukmachines van Agfa Graphics: een Jeti Tauro HS2500 en een Anapurna 3200i.
Zonder wisselkoerseffecten daalde de omzet van Agfa HealthCare met 6,0%.
Volgend op een herstel in de eerste zes maanden van het jaar, vertraagde de verkoop van de hardcopy-business van het Imaging-segment in het derde kwartaal door bepaalde late effecten van de reorganisatie van de distributiekanalen in China. Verwacht wordt dat de hardcopy-business in de loop van de volgende kwartalen weer zal aantrekken.
Het IT-segment presteerde goed, met een omzetgroei met dubbele cijfers en een verdere sterke toename van het orderboek voor het HealthCare Information Solutions-gamma. Over het algemeen voldeed het Imaging Solutions-gamma aan de verwachtingen, met goede prestaties in de meeste belangrijke regio’s en een vertraging in de VS.
 Vooral door ongunstige productmix-effecten in het Imaging-segment en de reeds vermelde late effecten van de reorganisatie van de hardcopy-distributiekanalen evolueerde Agfa HealthCare’s brutowinstmarge van 40,7% van de omzet in het derde kwartaal van 2018 tot 40,0%. De recurrente daalde van 35,7 miljoen euro (13,8% van de omzet) in het derde kwartaal van 2017 tot 24,4 miljoen euro (10,3% van de omzet). De recurrente kwam uit op 17,6 miljoen euro (7,4% van de omzet), tegenover 29,5 miljoen euro (11,4% van de omzet) in het voorgaande jaar.
Op het vlak van Imaging kondigde Agfa HealthCare het nieuwe Workstation aan. Dit zenuwcentrum van de beeldvormingsomgeving biedt een intuïtieve interface voor een vlotte en efficiënte verwerking van beelden van radiografie, fluoroscopie, mammografie en full leg/full spine-beeldvorming. Op basis van bewezen technologieën en door klanten aangebrachte innovaties, draagt het bij aan de flexibiliteit en maakt het maatwerk mogelijk.
In de besliste het Florida Hospital, onderdeel van het Adventist Health System, om Agfa HealthCare’s veelzijdige 800 Multi-Purpose Direct Radiogaphy-systeem te installeren in drie vestigingen.
Op het vlak van Imaging Solutions, noemde het Performance Report 2018 Agfa HealthCare als een sterke en richtinggevende partner voor zorgsystemen die enterprise imaging willen invoeren. is een onderzoeksfirma gericht op het verbeteren van de zorgverstrekking. Haar rapporten zijn gebaseerd op de feedback van zorgorganisaties en medische professionals.
Nog op het vlak van Imaging Solutions kondigde Agfa HealthCare de succesvolle ingebruikname aan van zijn Enterprise Imaging for Radiology-systeem in het Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow (Essex, VK). Het ziekenhuis maakt deel uit van de Princess Alexandra Hospital Trust.

Gedurende 2018 heeft de Groep het boekhoudkundig beleid dat ook in voorgaande jaren gold consequent toegepast, met uitzondering van de weergave van de winst- en verliesrekening en het geconsolideerd overzicht van gerealiseerde en niet-gerealiseerde resultaten. De weergave is gewijzigd ten gevolge van de toepassing van de nieuwe IFRS-standaard 9 ‘Financiële Instrumenten’. Volgens deze nieuwe standaard worden de waardeverminderingsverliezen op handels- en andere vorderingen nu weergegeven in de winst- en verliesrekening.

1) Gedurende 2018 heeft de Groep de presentatie van het geconsolideerde kasstroomoverzicht gewijzigd door toevoeging van een aparte weergave van de volgende niet-kaskosten: afwaarderingen op voorraden, bijzondere waardeverminderingsverliezen op handelsvorderingen, toevoegingen en terugnames van provisies en opgebouwde aan de periode toegewezen kosten voor personeelsbeloningen, toegezegdpensioenregelingen en andere personeelsplannen. Deze overige niet-kaskosten werden voorheen inbegrepen in wijzigingen van overige kortlopende activa en verplichtingen en veranderingen in langlopende en kortlopende voorzieningen en personeelsverplichtingen. Het management meent dat deze gewijzigde presentatie meer relevante informatie verschaft aan de lezer van de geconsolideerde financiële staten. De Groep heeft vergelijkende informatie van het voorgaande boekjaar aangepast.
2) Gedurende 2018 heeft de Groep het boekhoudkundig beleid dat ook in voorgaande jaren gold consequent toegepast met uitzondering van de weergave van de geconsolideerde balans en het geconsolideerd kasstroomoverzicht die beiden gewijzigd zijn tengevolge van de implementatie van 15 ‘Opbrengsten uit contracten met klanten’. De Groep heeft deze nieuwe standaard toegepast volgens de cumulatieve methode, waarbij het effect van eerste toepassing wordt getoond op 1 januari 2018. Dit betekent dat de Groep de nieuwe vereisten van de standaard niet toepast op vergelijkende jaarperioden die worden voorgesteld. Tengevolge de wijzigingen van de nieuwe standaard 15, zijn de kasstromen uit wijzigingen van overige kortlopende activa en verplichtingen niet vergelijkbaar met 2017 omwille van het feit dat de kas-instromen en -uitstromen van contractuele activa en verplichtingen verbonden aan contracten met klanten voor 2017 vervat zaten in wijzigingen in voorraden, wijzigingen in handelsvorderingen en wijzigingen in overige kortlopende activa en verplichtingen. Meer informatie wordt verschaft in voetnoot 1 van de geconsolideerde balans.
