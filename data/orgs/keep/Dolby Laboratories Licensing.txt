Learn how employees are making a difference in global communities.
employees are our greatest asset and the heart of our community efforts. Employees volunteer as individuals, as work teams, or as part of one of our eight diversity and inclusion employee network groups. From tutoring children and mentoring adults reentering the workforce to delivering meals to seniors or providing legal services through our legal pro-bono program, we encourage our employees to make our communities stronger. While our volunteer work is year round, nearly 1,000 employees donate their time during our Cares Day, which takes place in 22 communities in 14 countries each spring.
Our Impact
Inspiring the Next Generation of Innovators
Chief Scientist, Poppy Crum, speaks to aspiring technologists at Dolby’s annual Girls Who Code field trip.
We believe that a diversity of experiences, ideas, and approaches leads to the greatest innovations for storytelling in the cinema, on the go, at work, and at home. Sharing Dolby's unique position at the intersection of science, technology, and art with a new generation is at the heart of our educational efforts. We partner with organizations like Girls Who Code, Women’s Audio Mission, and Greene Scholars in the US, Women on the Move in France, and the New South Wales Women in Engineering summer camp for teens in Australia to host interactive field trips and mentoring for hundreds of youth from diverse backgrounds.
One example of the unique work does is our long-term collaboration with Marvel Studios, sponsoring nationwide contests to showcase the superpowers of young women ages 15–18. The goal of the contests is to honor young female inventors and showcase them as role models to inspire countless young girls to explore education and careers. The winners meet with top women technologists from Marvel and as well as getting the red-carpet treatment at the Hollywood premiere of a Marvel film.
Storytelling is at the heart of Dolby, and listening to and addressing the stories of challenges people face in our local communities is critical. That's why helping build a brighter future for people experiencing homelessness and other challenges is a priority for everyone at Dolby. With partners including Downtown Streets Team, Code Tenderloin, St. Anthony’s, and Olive Crest in the and Wayside Chapel in Australia, we help provide basic necessities, job-readiness education, mentoring, and support to help people succeed.
We also work to provide children with access to opportunities and experiences that excite them and set them up for success. To make this possible, we provide music, sports, and technology-based experiences for the students at the Beijing School for the Blind in China, sponsor the after-school enrichment programs at the Tenderloin Community School in the US, host hiking trips and fun events for underprivileged children in Poland and Germany, and more.
To truly have an impact in our communities, we work together with organizations that are addressing critical issues on a daily basis. We take a holistic approach with our partnerships providing volunteer, in-kind, and financial support. Organizations located in one of Dolby’s communities and whose work aligns with our focus areas are welcome to send information about their volunteer opportunities and programs to us at DolbyCares@dolby.com .
