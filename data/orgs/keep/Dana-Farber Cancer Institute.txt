SitemapFor Patients & Families
Patient- and Family-Centered Care
caregivers understand that a diagnosis affects each adult or child — and each family member — in different ways.
From your first visit … you'll find that our team is committed to supporting your physical and emotional needs, as well as those of your family members. To provide continuity throughout your care, you will be assigned a multidisciplinary     team of health care professionals led by a medical oncologist (specialist) or hematologist (blood disease specialist) who is a senior staff physician. If we are caring for your child, the team will include a pediatric oncologist or hematologist.
If you are hospitalized in Dana-Farber’s Inpatient Hospital located at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, your care team will include an attending physician (hospitalist), who will coordinate care among your specialists.
If your child is hospitalized at Boston Children's, the room will have bedside accommodations for one parent. Pediatric units have family support space and child activity rooms. Dana-Farber's Jimmy Fund Clinic is also built with your family in mind, providing     separate waiting areas for young children and teens. Inside the clinic, private consultation rooms offer comfortable waiting areas during initial visits and second opinions.
In addition to doctors and nurses, many other members of our team will support you and your family.
After your treatment is completed … we are still here for you. Dana-Farber's Adult Survivorship Program will help you find expertise, education, and support     to manage issues related to surviving cancer. This includes managing the risk of second cancers, understanding the long-term effects of treatment, and addressing your social, physical, or psychological concerns.
For children, we offer two childhood survivorship clinics — one each for general oncology and  childhood brain tumor survivors .     Our brain tumor survivorship clinic is one of only a few in the United States completely dedicated to pediatric brain tumor survivors.
