Established in 1969 as Research Corporation, first gained recognition in the advanced technology manufacturing and development field for their sophisticated steel-clad, honeycomb core tables designed to isolate laser experiments from vibration. As holography, interferometry and other laser technologies progressed, so did - expanding its product offerings to meet the evolving needs of scientists and engineers in the field. We have acquired a number of companies, which has led to the expansion of our product offerings, technology base and geographic presence and has allowed us to evolve from a provider of discrete components and instruments primarily for research applications to a company that manufactures both components and integrated systems for both research and commercial applications. Thanks to a steadfast commitment to quality, innovation, hard work and customer care - is trusted the world over as the complete source for all photonics and laser technologies, products and systems.
In April 2016, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Instruments, Inc. Instruments is a global provider of instruments, subsystems and process control solutions that measure, control, power, monitor and analyze critical parameters of advanced manufacturing processes to improve process performance and productivity, and is a proven technology leader. As a part of the family, can deliver great value to our customers, as the combined company has extensive capabilities, a broad technology portfolio and an intense focus on delivering innovative solutions for your high precision applications.
