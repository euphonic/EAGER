applies a precautionary approach in innovation and in the development of new products. We consider not only the benefits of our products but also the potential health and environmental risks in a scientific and transparent manner.
To reduce our impact, we work in 7 key areas:
Using natural resources responsibly
is committed to improving its carbon footprint, energy efficiency, water conservation and waste control. This benefits our company both environmentally and economically, creating a positive result for local communities. The commitment is illustrated by a transparent reporting system and growing engagement with suppliers and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs).
Cutting carbon emissions is central  to our green strategy. Our ambition to become carbon neutral by 2030  relates in first instance to the activities we control directly.  However, more than half of our total carbon footprint is produced by our  suppliers and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs). That is why  we work closely with these partners to ensure they are transparently  reporting energy use and making every effort to reduce energy  consumption.
Our production sites consume a lot of energy. We  view thian opportunity to make a meaningful impact on our CO2  output. Last year, reduced overall energy consumption by 5%; usage  of gas and electricity was reduced by 9% and 4% respectively. These absolute reductions were partly due  to divestments.
Key contributors were an optimization of the Multicolumn Continuous Chromatography (MCC) equipment used at the chemical production plant in Bulle and energy efficiency gains in the distribution of fluidthe chemical production plant in Braine l’Alleud and in the microbial inactivation procesthe bioplant in Bulle.
In 2017, 92% of the electricity consumed by originated from renewable sources, with six sites relying fully on  electricity generated from renewable sources, i.e., Bulle (Switzerland), Monheim (Germany), Atlanta (U.S.), Slough (U.K.) Braine-l’Alleud and Brussels (Belgium). Electricity sources include solar, wind and hydropower, as well as, biomass.
generated 2 336 GigaJoules of electricity through solar panels installed in Braine-l’Alleud and Bulle, an increase of 52% compared to 2016 due to the installation of additional solar panels in Braine l’Alleud.
In addition, we are working with our employees to achieve significant savings on business travel and  to reduce commuting.
To complement our efforts to reduce energy consumption and  to use as much as possible energy generated from renewable sources, embraces carbon compensation.
Forests are natural ‘sinks’ for carbon, absorbing tons of greenhouse gases every year. By investing in forestry, we can help to balance our overall carbon  impact.
Water is a precious resource. It playvital role in our production process and in climate control for our  products. Water consumption at facilities decreased by 6% in 2017 and we will continue to strive for greater efficiency.
In 2017, waste generated at the facilities decreased by 19%. globally managed to recover 91% of its waste, predominantly through recovery of waste as a fuel to generate energy, and the recovery and regeneration of solvents. This percentage of recuperated waste steadily improved by more than 5%, when compared to 2010.Top of this page

In everything we do, we always start by asking ourselves “How can we create more value for people living with severe diseases?".
In the interest of patients, it is crucial for us to collaborate closely with healthcare professionals and organisations, who offer us invaluable and expert knowledge to provide solutions improving patients’ lives and treatments.  This relationship has delivered significant innovations in healthcare so far and has made positive changes to the quality of life of numerous patients.
We aspire to maintain high standards of ethics and integrity in our interactions.  We strongly believe that ensuring transparency in our financial relationships with healthcare professionals is essential to increase patients’ trust.  Patients need to know that they can trust their doctors to recommend, prescribe and administer appropriate care and treatments based solely on clinical evidence and experience.
Member Company (European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry and Associations), we are therefore committed to meet the transparency requirements of the Disclosure Code and to report our transfers of value to healthcare stakeholders accordingly.  
If you have any questions about transparency initiatives or reports, please contact

aims to make every element of our businesgreen as possible. That is why we are rethinking 
Until recently, our efforts were focused on being compliant with regulations and improving the user experience. We are now shifting our approach, giving greater importance to sustainable design and materials. 
recognises that improving our product packaging, through collaboration with patients and users, presentopportunity to enhance the sustainability of our operations. Packaging design iimportant part of delivering value to patients while reducing our products’ environmental footprint. 
Listening to public feedback on our products, including their packaging, is a central part of our commitment to improve what we do. The message we hear is that the production, transport and packaging of our products should minimise the use of plastics and maximise recyclability. 
We are rising to the challenge of creating packaging that is greener, compliant with on-pack labelling requirements, includes measures to combat counterfeit drugs, meet cost constraints, and fulfils the need to make an emotional connection with patients, while enhancing patient compliance. This is a work in progress and we are committed to getting it right. 
Along with improving the user experience, this collaborative approach is helping us to make packaging more environmentally friendly. We are prioritising the use of recyclable materials, responsible sourcing, resource recovery (recycling), efficient transport and distribution. 
For example, by reducing the pack size while maintaining the same amount of medicines we can use less material and transport more products on each pallet. Reducing the weight of packaging also translates into lower use of fuel in transport. 
In collaboration with patients and design experts, we have reduced the plastic content of the packaging on some of our leading medicines by as much as 85% and reduced the carboard content by 41%. By using recyclable materials and ensuring the packaging components can be segregated for recycling, we are applying the best in design thinking to optimise our packaging. 
As some of our products are self-administered by patients with severe conditions – such as rheumatoid arthritis or Parkinson’s disease – the distinct needs of the user must be considered carefully. 
For example, our new auto-click prefilled pen, used to deliver rheumatoid arthritis medication in Japan, was developed based on market research and input from users. Research showed us that ease of drug administration was a key concern for users and that patients in Japan valued simple, crisp packaging design. 
By consulting patients and patient representatives, we will collaboratively develop best-in-class package designs that meet the needs of users while removing inefficiencies. 
continues to make sustainability and usability key priorities in the design of our products and packaging.  By making sustainability a design priority, we will further reduce our carbon footprint and our impact on the environment.
