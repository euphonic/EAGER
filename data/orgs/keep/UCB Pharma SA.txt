At UCB,  we take our responsibility to the planet very seriously. Our  goal is to  develop and produce medicines for people with severe  diseases in the  most environmentally sustainable way possible.
applies a precautionary approach in innovation and in the development of new products. We consider not only the benefits of our products but also the potential health and environmental risks in a scientific and transparent manner.
To reduce our impact, we work in 7 key areas:
Ensuring legal and regulatory compliance
Using natural resources responsibly
Promoting green chemistry
Actively managing waste streams
Sustainability and Stewardship
is committed to improving its carbon footprint, energy efficiency, water conservation and waste control. This benefits our company both environmentally and economically, creating a positive result for local communities. The commitment is illustrated by a transparent reporting system and growing engagement with suppliers and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs).
Saving energy
Cutting carbon emissions is central  to our green strategy. Our ambition to become carbon neutral by 2030  relates in first instance to the activities we control directly.  However, more than half of our total carbon footprint is produced by our  suppliers and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs). That is why  we work closely with these partners to ensure they are transparently  reporting energy use and making every effort to reduce energy  consumption.
Our production sites consume a lot of energy. We  view thian opportunity to make a meaningful impact on our CO2  output. Last year, reduced overall energy consumption by 5%; usage  of gas and electricity was reduced by 9% and 4% respectively. These absolute reductions were partly due  to divestments.
Changing our energy consumption
Overall energy consumption ↓5%
Gas usage ↓9%
Energy  saving initiatives in 2017 saved 7 135 GigaJoules. Energy saving  projects were completed at the sites in Bulle (Swizerland), Braine  l’Alleud (Belgium) and Zhuhai (China).
Key contributors were an optimization of the Multicolumn Continuous Chromatography (MCC) equipment used at the chemical production plant in Bulle and energy efficiency gains in the distribution of fluidthe chemical production plant in Braine l’Alleud and in the microbial inactivation procesthe bioplant in Bulle.
In 2017, 92% of the electricity consumed by originated from renewable sources, with six sites relying fully on  electricity generated from renewable sources, i.e., Bulle (Switzerland), Monheim (Germany), Atlanta (U.S.), Slough (U.K.) Braine-l’Alleud and Brussels (Belgium). Electricity sources include solar, wind and hydropower, as well as, biomass.
generated 2 336 GigaJoules of electricity through solar panels installed in Braine-l’Alleud and Bulle, an increase of 52% compared to 2016 due to the installation of additional solar panels in Braine l’Alleud.
In addition, we are working with our employees to achieve significant savings on business travel and  to reduce commuting.
Carbon compensation
To complement our efforts to reduce energy consumption and  to use as much as possible energy generated from renewable sources, embraces carbon compensation.
Forests are natural ‘sinks’ for carbon, absorbing tons of greenhouse gases every year. By investing in forestry, we can help to balance our overall carbon  impact.
Conserving water

alt vi gjør, starter vi alltid med å spørre oss selv ”Hvordan kan vi gi mennesker som har alvorlige sykdommer et bedre liv”?
Det er i pasientenes interesse at vi samarbeider med tett helsepersonell og helseorganisasjoner. Dette gir oss uvurderlig ekspertkunnslik at vi kan finne løsninger som bedrer pasientenes liv og behandling. Så langt har denne relasjonen bidradd til betydelig innovasjon innen helse, og har gitt mange positive endringer i livskvaliteten for mange pasienter.
Vi streber etter å opprettholde høy standard for etikk og integritet når det gjelder samhandling. Vi mener at det å sikre åpenhet med hensyn til finansielle relasjoner med helsepersonell er viktig for å øke pasientenes tillitt. Det er viktig at pasientene kan stole på at legen anbefaler, forskriver og gir riktig behandling, og at kun er basert på kliniske bevis og erfaring.
Som et EFPIA-medlem (European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry and Associations), er selskapet derfor forpliktet til å oppfylle kravene om offentliggjøring i henhold til Disclosure Code, og av den grunn rapportere verdioverføringer som gjøres til helsepersonell og helseorganisasjoner.

In everything we do, we always start by asking ourselves “How can we create more value for people living with severe diseases?".
In the interest of patients, it is crucial for us to collaborate closely with healthcare professionals and organisations, who offer us invaluable and expert knowledge to provide solutions improving patients’ lives and treatments.  This relationship has delivered significant innovations in healthcare so far and has made positive changes to the quality of life of numerous patients.
We aspire to maintain high standards of ethics and integrity in our interactions.  We strongly believe that ensuring transparency in our financial relationships with healthcare professionals is essential to increase patients’ trust.  Patients need to know that they can trust their doctors to recommend, prescribe and administer appropriate care and treatments based solely on clinical evidence and experience.
Member Company (European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry and Associations), we are therefore committed to meet the transparency requirements of the Disclosure Code and to report our transfers of value to healthcare stakeholders accordingly.

Vad vi än gör börjar vi alltid med att ställa oss själva frågan “Hur kan vi skapa mervärde för personer med svåra sjukdomar?".
Med tanke på patienternas bästa är det mycket viktigt för oss att ha ett nära samarbete med hälso- och sjukvårdspersonal samt organisationer, eftersom vi på så sätt får värdefull och sakkunnig information som vi behöver för att kunna erbjuda lösningar som förbättrar patienternas liv och behandlingar. Samarbetet har hittills åstadkommit betydande innovationer inom hälsovården och förbättrat livskvaliteten för ett stort antal patienter.
Vi strävar efter att i vårt samarbete upprätthålla en hög standard i fråga om etik och integritet. Vi är övertygade om att det är mycket viktigt att säkerställa att våra värdeöverföringar till hälso- och sjukvårdspersonal är transparenta för att öka patienternas förtroende. Patienterna bör kunna lita på att läkaren rekommenderar, förskriver och administrerar lämplig behandling uteslutande baserat på kliniska bevis och erfarenhet.
Som ett medlemsföretag i den europeiska branschorganisationen (European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry and Associations) har åtagit sig att följa transparensreglerna i EFPIA:s uppförandekod och att rapportera värdeöverföringar till aktörer inom hälso- och sjukvården i enlighet med dessa regler.

В усьому, що ми робимо, ми завжди розпочинаємо  з питання до себе: “Як ми можемо створити дещо більш цінне  для людей, які живуть, страждаючи від тяжких хвороб?"
В інтересах пацієнтів вирішальною для нас є тісна співпраця з професіоналами з надання медичних послуг та з організаціями, які пропонують  нам безцінне та експертне знання для забезпечення рішень щодо поліпшення життя та лікування пацієнтів. Цей взаємозв’язок на даному етапі вніс значні інновації у надання медичних послуг та призвів до позитивних змін якості життя численних пацієнтів.
Ми прагнемо підтримувати високі стандарти етики та чесності у наших взаємовідносинах.  Ми рішуче віримо у те, що гарантування прозорості наших фінансових взаємовідносин з професіоналами з надання медичних послуг є необхідним для збільшення довіри з боку пацієнтів.  Пацієнтам потрібно знати, що вони можуть довіряти своїм лікарям, коли ті рекомендують, приписують, та здійснюють  відповідний догляд та лікування на підставі виключно клінічних фактів та досвіду.
Як компанія-член (Європейської федерації фармацевтичних виробників та асоціацій), ми прагнемо задовольнити вимоги Кодексу розкриття і відповідно звітувати про наші передачі коштів перед зацікавленими особами,  зайнятими наданням медичних послуг.
Якщо у Вас є будь-які питання щодо ініціатив із дотримання прозорості або стосовно звітів, будь ласка, зверніться до місцевої поштової скриньки.

Kaikkea toimintaamme ohjaa itsellemme aina ensin esittämämme kysymys: “Miten voin luoda enemmän arvoa niille, joilla on jokin vaikea sairaus?"
Tiivis yhteistyö terveydenhuollon ammattilaisten ja organisaatioiden kanssa on meille ehdottoman tärkeää potilaiden edun vuoksi: näiltä toimijoilta saamme mittaamattoman arvokasta ja asiantuntevaa tietoa, jonka perusteella voimme tarjota potilaiden elämää ja hoitoa parantavia ratkaisuja. Tähänastinen yhteistyö onkin jo synnyttänyt merkittäviä terveydenhoidon innovaatioita ja kohentanut lukemattomien potilaiden elämänlaatua.
Haluamme peruyhteistyömme korkeisiin eettisiin periaatteisiin ja lahjomattomuuteen. Uskomme vakaasti, että läpinäkyvyyden varmistaminen terveydenhuollon ammattilaisten kanssa solmittavissa taloudellisissa suhteissa on välttämätöntä potilaiden luottamuksen lisäämiseksi. Potilaiden on voitava luottaa siihen, että lääkäri suosittelee, määrää ja antaa asianmukaista hoitoa vain kliiniseen näyttöön ja kokemukseen perustuen.

Tällainen suostumus on annettu yhtiön hyväksymien sovellettavien ohjeistojen noudattamiseksi.

aims to make every element of our businesgreen as possible. That is why we are rethinking 
our approach to packaging
Until recently, our efforts were focused on being compliant with regulations and improving the user experience. We are now shifting our approach, giving greater importance to sustainable design and materials. 
recognises that improving our product packaging, through collaboration with patients and users, presentopportunity to enhance the sustainability of our operations. Packaging design iimportant part of delivering value to patients while reducing our products’ environmental footprint. 
Listening to public feedback on our products, including their packaging, is a central part of our commitment to improve what we do. The message we hear is that the production, transport and packaging of our products should minimise the use of plastics and maximise recyclability. 
We are rising to the challenge of creating packaging that is greener, compliant with on-pack labelling requirements, includes measures to combat counterfeit drugs, meet cost constraints, and fulfils the need to make an emotional connection with patients, while enhancing patient compliance. This is a work in progress and we are committed to getting it right. 
Along with improving the user experience, this collaborative approach is helping us to make packaging more environmentally friendly. We are prioritising the use of recyclable materials, responsible sourcing, resource recovery (recycling), efficient transport and distribution. 
For example, by reducing the pack size while maintaining the same amount of medicines we can use less material and transport more products on each pallet. Reducing the weight of packaging also translates into lower use of fuel in transport. 
In collaboration with patients and design experts, we have reduced the plastic content of the packaging on some of our leading medicines by as much as 85% and reduced the carboard content by 41%. By using recyclable materials and ensuring the packaging components can be segregated for recycling, we are applying the best in design thinking to optimise our packaging. 
As some of our products are self-administered by patients with severe conditions – such as rheumatoid arthritis or Parkinson’s disease – the distinct needs of the user must be considered carefully. 
For example, our new auto-click prefilled pen, used to deliver rheumatoid arthritis medication in Japan, was developed based on market research and input from users. Research showed us that ease of drug administration was a key concern for users and that patients in Japan valued simple, crisp packaging design. 
By consulting patients and patient representatives, we will collaboratively develop best-in-class package designs that meet the needs of users while removing inefficiencies. 
continues to make sustainability and usability key priorities in the design of our products and packaging.  By making sustainability a design priority, we will further reduce our carbon footprint and our impact on the environment.
