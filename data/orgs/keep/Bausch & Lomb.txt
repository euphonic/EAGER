40s and 50s Eyes
If you’re like most people in their 20s and 30s, you enjoy excellent vision. You might even be emmetropic – that is, your vision is naturally 20/20, and hasn’t changed since you were a child. Or perhaps your 20/20 vision comes with the help of glasses or contact lenses. Regardless, if you’re doing the right things to help maintain good health, your eyesight can stay at the same level for a decade or more.
The single best way to protect your vision is through regular professional 
. You may be at risk for eye problems if there is a family history of eye disease, diabetes, high blood pressure or poor vision. In between examinations, if you notice a change in your vision – or you think your eye may be injured in any way – contact your eye care professional as soon as possible.
Getting enough rest, eating foods rich in antioxidants, taking special care in applying cosmetics and hair spray, and – most of all – washing your hands often to help keep your eyes free of germs and bacteria that cause infection. These healthy habits are important to maintain proper 
At this age, you probably have a lot on your plate. But you also have more 
 options than before to address farsightedness (hyperopia), nearsightedness (myopia) or astigmatism. Which means it’s also a good time to learn more about 
, to understand why you have good vision today – and what changes you may begin to see as you reach your mid- to late 30s.

As we age, eye exams become even more important. In fact, if you are over 60 years old, you should have an eye exam every year. These exams are even more important if you have high blood pressure, diabetes or a family history of eye disease. Vision problems may develop with no physical symptoms until they’re quite advanced. The best chance to safe-guard your vision is to detect issues early with regular eye examinations. Between examinations, if you notice a change in your vision, or your eye is injured in any way, contact your eye doctor as soon as possible.
 to list all of your current concerns, health issues and your family history. The more your eye care professional knows, the better protected you’ll be against potentially debilitating vision loss.
During your eye exam, your eye care professional has an unobstructed view of blood vessels, nerves and connecting tissue and abnormalities spotted in the eye may signal the same abnormalities in other parts of the body. Many illnesses can be detected during a comprehensive eye exam; diabetes, high blood pressure, autoimmune diseases, sexually transmitted diseases and cancers are examples. 
 What To Expect at an Eye Exam 
Typically, your eye doctor will review your personal and family health history for hereditary problems of eye disease, diabetes, high blood pressure or poor vision.  
. While you look at an eye chart, the doctor will measure your vision precisely, and, if necessary, determine a prescription for corrective lenses. 
 - The doctor will move a light in a set pattern to test your ability to use both eyes together. 
 - The doctor will move an object at the edge of your field of vision to make sure you can see it. 
 - The doctor will shine a light in your eye and watch the pupil's reaction. 
 - The doctor will ask you to describe figures in a series of illustrations made up of numerous colored dots or circles. This tests your ability to differentiate colors. 
 - The doctor will examine your eyelid, inside and out. 
The interior and back of the eye
 - After dilating your eyes (by both using a few eye drops and dimming the lights so the pupils will widen), the doctor will use a special instrument called an ophthalmoscope to see through to the retina and optic nerve at the back of the eye. This is where clues to many eye diseases first show up. 
 - The doctor will release a puff of air onto your eye using an instrument called a tonometer.  This tests the pressure inside the eye, an early indicator of 
You may also self-monitor between professional visits by looking at an Amsler grid. This is a pattern that resembles a checkerboard with a dot in the center. While staring at the dot, you may notice that the straight lines in the pattern appear wavy. Or you may notice that some of the lines are missing. Print and take the quick vision test using the 
Do the test with each eye separately by covering the eye that’s not being tested. 
Hold the test grid directly in front of you, about 14 inches from your face, and look at the dot in the center of the grid, not at the lines. 
While looking at the dot, all the lines, both vertical and horizontal, should appear straight and unbroken. 
If any of the straight lines appear wavy, or you notice that some of the lines seem to be missing, note their location on the grid for future reference.

If the images you see are blurred, one or more of the following four conditions could be responsible.
 For a nearsighted person, close objects are clear, but distant objects are blurred and difficult to distinguish. 
 Farsightedness (Hyperopia) 
 Technically known as hyperopia, people who are farsighted have difficulty seeing close objects; distant objects may be clear but up close objects appear blurry. 
 For people with astigmatism, all objects both near and far are distorted. 
 Presbyopia is a natural occurrence in which the eye can no longer focus near objects. It commonly develops in people around the age of 40.

Vision problems affect one in 20 preschoolers and one in four school-age children. And since many vision problems begin at an early age, it’s very important that children receive proper eye care. Poor eyesight can also affect learning ability, athletic performance, and self-esteem. Untreated eye conditions can worsen and lead to more serious problems. For all of these reasons, the best way to protect your child’s vision is by having regular eye examinations.
Your pediatrician has probably tested your child’s eyesight to determine your child's ability to focus, recognize colors, and perceive depth or dimension. If your pediatrician sees anything out of the ordinary, you’ll be advised to make an appointment with a licensed eye doctor who will perform a thorough evaluation of your child’s eyes.
Regardless, children should have a comprehensive eye exam by a licensed eye doctor at six months, 3 years of age, before first grade and every two years thereafter or as recommended. The doctor will determine if your child needs vision correction and check for

Your eyesight changes as you get older, sometimes significantly – that’s why regular eye exams are even more important as we age. Don't skip your recommended annual eye exams. Many eye diseases have no early symptoms; they may be painless, and you may see no change in your vision until the disease has become quite advanced. If you are experiencing any unusual vision symptoms, see your eye care professional immediately.
Do your eyes feel drier than normal? Your tear glands may have lost some ability to produce moisture and keep your eyes properly lubricated. Certain medications may also cause eye dryness. 
 eye drops work like real tears to moisturize and alleviate the discomfort of

For this reason, it is important to frequently be checked by an eye doctor for ocular hypertension (a condition with high pressure in the eye which can mean a person is at high risk for glaucoma).

While cataracts can occur as a result of other eye diseases, they mostly develop naturally with age. In fact, by age 65, many of us will develop a cataract. Most cataracts can be treated by your ophthalmologist, who may replace your eye’s lens with an intraocular lens (IOL).

Despite all the things you do to keep your children safe – at home, on the playground, and in the car – accidents happen. Each year, thousands of children visit emergency rooms and doctors’ offices with eye injuries.
Most eye injuries come from a handful of causes. Toys that are used inappropriately; falling into or off of a piece of furniture; using tools and other objects incorrectly like running with scissors; aerosols and chemicals; and car accidents when children are not in safety seats. Taking proper 
precautions such as wearing goggles or safety glasses with side shields can help prevent eye injuries. 
Goggles and shields will help to protect your child's eyes from injury while playing sports. Wearing protective eyewear may help to prevent 90 percent of eye injuries. Many goggles or safety glasses come with tints to reduce sun glare and polycarbonate lenses that stand up to sudden, sharp impact. 
Be sure to wear appropriate eye protection based on the activity or sport you are doing. 
Can You Teach Eye Safety Behavior to Your Children?

Wear safety goggles when you work with chemicals and other hazardous materials. 
Wear a hat and sunglasses to shield your eyes on bright, sunny days, or when snow or ice gleam in the sunlight. 
Wash your hands often and keep your hands away from your eyes and nose to inhibit the spread of colds and other viruses.
If you use sparklers or fireworks, follow the guidelines for safe use presented by the

The best way to protect your baby's eyes is through regular professional examinations. Certain infectious, congenital, or hereditary eye diseases may be present at birth or develop shortly thereafter. Yet, when diagnosed early, their impact may be greatly minimized.
So have your baby's eyes examined – by a licensed eye doctor – before six months of age (or sooner if recommended by your pediatrician) and regularly throughout his or her life.
 How Can Prepare For My Baby's Eye Exam 
Chances are your pediatrician will examine your baby’s eyes in one of your first few visits. The pediatrician will review your baby's health and family health history. You can prepare for your baby's appointment using our

 How Will the Doctor Test My Baby's Eyesight? 
The pediatrician may use toys and lights to determine your baby's ability to focus, recognize colors, and perceive depth or dimension. Here are some things you may see during the exam: 
 Using toys that make noises (or are otherwise intriguing) the pediatrician will cover and quickly uncover each eye to test how well your baby's eyes work together.
 Your pediatrician will move an object in front of your baby’s eyes to see if the eyes can watch and follow the object.
 The pediatrician will move a light or some interesting toys in a set pattern to test your baby's ability to see sharply and clearly at near and far distances.
 The pediatrician will shine a small light (a penlight, for example) in your baby's eye and watch the pupil's reaction. The pupil normally would get smaller very quickly in response to light.
 The pediatrician will examine each eyelid to be sure it is functioning normally.  This includes a check for drooping eyelid, inflammation, and any other indications that your baby’s eyes need greater attention.
If your pediatrician sees anything out of the ordinary, you’ll be advised to make an appointment with a licensed eye doctor who will perform a more comprehensive evaluation of your baby’s eyes.
Babies should have their first comprehensive eye exam by a licensed eye doctor at six months. licensed eye doctor will perform additional tests that the pediatrician does not.  This is essential if there are any major vision issues that run in your family, as they may have been inherited.

Despite every precaution, accidents may happen. If your baby's eye is injured, you should always get immediate, professional medical attention. It’s the best way to safeguard your baby's vision.
Here are some tips in the event of an eye injury (these tips are not meant to 
 If your baby is hit in the eye, rest a protective shield—such as a Styrofoam cup—on the bone around the eye. Make sure there is no pressure on the eye itself.  Get immediate, professional medical attention. 
 If an object has entered the eye, do not try to remove it; you may tear delicate tissue or force the object in deeper. Rest a protective shield—such as a Styrofoam cup—on the bone around the eye, making sure there is no pressure on the eye itself.  Get immediate, professional medical attention. 
 If your baby is hit in the eye area, place an ice pack or cold cloth over the eye.  Get immediate, professional medical attention. 
 If your baby's eye has sustained a chemical burn, rinse it with fresh water for at least 20 - 30 minutes. Use a clean container to pour water into their eye. As you rinse, use your fingers to hold their eye open as wide as possible to ensure the greatest possible coverage.  Get immediate, professional medical attention.

The best way to help preserve and protect your vision is through regular professional eye examinations. In your teenage years, annual eye exams are recommended. If you've been wearing eyeglasses you'll want to keep up with the changes in your vision by updating your prescription, but you also want to be certain there’s no vision problem beginning to develop. It may also be time to determine if you’re “ready” for contacts. This may not be based on any sort of age guidelines – only your willingness to care for and wear lenses properly. 
Between examinations, if you notice a change in your vision – or your eye is injured in any way – tell your parents so they can contact your eye doctor as soon as possible.
 What Can You Expect from a Comprehensive Eye Exam? 
Each eye doctor has a routine, but most comprehensive eye exams follow a similar pattern. First, the doctor will review your personal and family health history to check for eye disease, diabetes, high blood pressure or poor vision.  
. While you look at an eye chart, the doctor will measure your vision precisely, and, if necessary, determine a prescription for corrective lenses. 
 - The doctor will move a light in a set pattern to test your ability to use both eyes together. 
 - The doctor will move an object at the edge of your field of vision to make sure you can see it. 
 - The doctor will shine a light in each eye and watch the pupil's reaction. 
 - The doctor will ask you to describe figures in a series of illustrations made up of numerous colored dots or circles. This tests your ability to differentiate colors. 
 - The doctor will examine your eyelid, inside and out. 
The interior and back of the eye
 - After dilating your eyes (by both using a few eye drops and dimming the lights so the pupils will widen), the doctor will use a special instrument called an ophthalmoscope to see through to the retina and optic nerve at the back of the eye. This is where clues to many eye diseases first show up. 
 - The doctor will measure the pressure inside your eye using an instrument called a tonometer. High pressure inside the eye, can be an early indicator of

, it may help you test your vision and alert you to a vision problem that requires professional attention. And it may be kind of fun. You’ll need a friend to help you, so grab someone and try it!
Tape it on a bare, windowless wall approximately 4 feet above the floor. 
Sit in a chair 10 feet from the wall. If you normally wear contact lenses or glasses, wear them for this test. 
Ask your friend to hold a cover (such as a handkerchief or paper cup) over one of your eyes and use a flashlight to point at each line of the chart, starting at the top. Keeping both eyes open, read each letter out loud as your friend points. 
Record the number, such as 20/20, of the smallest line you can read correctly. 
Repeat steps four and five with the other eye. 
If you have difficulty seeing the chart clearly, you may need

Parents are usually the first to notice that their children may have special vision needs, so if you have any concerns about your child’s vision, don’t hesitate to talk to your pediatrician or eye doctor. Some warning signs of vision needs include: 
Holding a book close to eyes
Some issues require no treatment, while others may be corrected easily with eyeglasses, or other forms of correction. In all cases, the best chance to make sure your child’s vision is safe is to detect issues early with regular eye examinations. Don't hesitate to talk to your pediatrician or eye care professional if you have any concerns. 
About 25 percent of school-age children have a vision disorder. Here are common eye conditions:
, or myopia, affects distance vision. Your child may read without difficulty, but will squint to see objects that are across the playground or far off.
 is a condition in which your cornea or, in some cases, the lens behind the cornea is not equally curved in all directions. Astigmatism causes images to blur because light rays are focused on some parts of the eye and not others. Objects that are close-up or far off can be equally distorted.
These three issues can be corrected easily with corrective lenses.
What Other Things Should Be on the Lookout for?
If you spot a problem or a strange behavior in your child’s eyes, be sure to contact your eye doctor immediately, regardless of your child’s age. While most children’s eyes develop normally, some of the problems can emerge in young children.
Choose the symptom below to learn more about what to watch for, and the terms your eye doctor will use and how to get more information.
 in their children when their children are young. In other cases, symptoms are so slight, they may not even be noticed. Common symptoms of color blindness include difficulty distinguishing between colors and an inability to see shades or tones of the same color.
One eye may turn in towards the nose, or the eyes may seem to move independently, as if they can’t work together. This is known as 
, a condition that occurs when the eyes are not able to align on the same point at the same time, and appear to be misaligned or pointed in different directions. The eye that turns off-target may be the same in every incidence, or it could be a different eye at different times.
One child in 20 has crossed eyes or trouble tracking. This is often not a condition babies or children simply outgrow so children with eyes that seem to be misaligned should be examined and treated if necessary. Generally, it is easier to correct when caught early. 
If your child’s eyelid droops over the eye and appears as though it would block their vision, your child may be developing 
, or “lazy eye”. Amblyopia occurs when there is reduced vision in one eye because the eye and the brain are not working together. The brain may start to ignore the image from the amblyopic eye. Amblyopia normally only affects one eye - resulting in the amblyopic eye appearing "lazy". It is often associated with strabismus, or crossed eyes, when an individual’s eyes appear directed toward two different points instead of one.

Milky white covering over the pupil
 in one or both eyes. This can appear as a milky white covering over the pupil, and may be detected at birth.
   The surgical procedure for cataracts in children is much like it is for adults, involving the removal of the affected lens in the eye. After cataract surgery, your child will need glasses or contact lenses to see before a permanent intraocular lens is implanted. Your eye doctor may choose to use 
 contact lenses for aphakia which are designed for children who have had cataract surgery where an intraocular lens has not been implanted.
If your child's eyes have yellowish or greenish discharge and are red and irritated, he or she may have a condition called 
, or conjunctivitis. Pink eye can come from many causes, but it generally is the result of a bacterial or viral infection. In some cases, it may come from 
, environmental chemicals, or passed on from a mother to child during childbirth. The underlying cause of pink eye will determine the course of treatment so talk to your child's pediatrician or eye doctor.
If your child’s eyes seem to jump, vibrate back and forth, or move erratically in a way that looks unusual to you, he or she may have 
. This condition may signal that the eyes’ motor system is not developing normally. If you have a relative with nystagmus, or if you have it yourself, it’s possible that your child could develop this as well – so it’s important to tell your child's pediatrician or eye doctor during your child’s eye examination if nystagmus runs in your family.
The American Nystagmus Network
Sometimes photos can uncover common and uncommon eye concerns - from the way the flash reflects off the retina. If a photo is taken under optimal conditions and you see a white, yellow or black reflection in one or both of your child's eyes - show your child's pediatrician or eye doctor; this may be a warning sign.
Read how this helped one mother on the American Academy of Ophthalmology website, "
Remember, the best way to help keep your child's eyes healthy is through regular professional eye examinations. Be sure to have your child's eyes examined – by a licensed eye doctor – before six months of age and again at age 3.

Regular eye exams are the best way to protect your eyesight. There are also simple things you can do to help protect your eyes.
Eye injuries can occur during activities like yard work, cleaning or while playing sports. In most cases of injury, people report not properly protecting their eyes. Taking proper precautions such as wearing goggles or safety glasses with side shields can help prevent eye injuries.
Yes! Goggles and shields do help to protect your eyes from injury. Wearing protective eyewear may help to prevent 90 percent of eye injuries. Many goggles or safety glasses come with tints to reduce sun glare, light-filtering capabilities that make it easier to see certain colors (like yellow tennis balls), and polycarbonate lenses that stand up to sudden, sharp impact. Be sure to wear appropriate eye protection based on the activity or sport you are doing. 
Accidents happen. And because it’s not easy to judge the extent or severity of any eye injury, you should always get immediate, professional medical attention. It’s the best way to safeguard your vision.
The following signs and symptoms may signal serious eye injury:  
Cuts to the eyelid
One eye not moving as well as the other
One eye sticks out compared to the other
Blood in the clear part of the eye
Something embedded in the eye
Something under the eyelid that cannot be easily removed
In minor cases of trauma, such as a black eye from a sports injury, applying cold to the affected area can help bring swelling down, and allow the affected area to heal faster. However, even in cases where trauma seems minor, every eye injury should be given medical attention.
Chemical eye burns may occur when the eye comes into contact with a solid, liquid or gas chemical. If a chemical comes into contact with the eye, immediately flush the eyes thoroughly with water. All burns should be taken seriously as they can result in permanent damage. Consult your eye doctor if you experience a chemical eye burn.
To protect your eyes from chemical burns, always wear full goggles - not safety glasses with side shields - when using harsh chemicals.
Protect Your Eyes from the Sun
Sure, sunglasses look cool. But they also protect your eyes from harmful ultra violet (UV) rays to help prevent long-term damage. Choose sunglasses with both and protection, to block both forms of ultraviolet rays. hat will help block indirect sun, which can come into the eyes around the edges of sunglasses.
And like prolonged sun exposure — tanning beds can lead to serious eye damage. Tanning beds can produce levels up to 100x what you would get from the sun causing serious damage to the eye and eyelids.

40s and 50s Eyes
While chances are excellent that your baby's vision will develop normally, some infants have a higher risk for certain conditions that may affect their sight later in life.
As babies grow and their eyes reach full development, parents are often the first to notice signs that their baby may have special vision needs. Don't hesitate to talk to your baby's pediatrician or eye doctor if you have any concerns.
Find the symptom below to learn more about the potential eye problems, what to watch for, and what can be done if/when your baby needs special eye care.
It’s not uncommon for an infant’s eyes to look crossed, as if they’re turned in opposite directions. One eye may turn in towards the nose, or the eyes may seem to move independently, as if they can’t work together. For a baby less than four months old, the eyes are still learning to function as a unit – so crossing is simply a sign of continuing development. If the crossed eyes persist after your baby reaches four months old, it’s time to talk to your eye doctor about 
, a medical condition that can and should be treated.
Crossed eyes develop most often in babies. It is easier to correct when caught early. This is often not a condition babies or children simply outgrow so children with eyes that seem to be misaligned should be examined and treated if necessary.
If your baby’s eyelid seems to droop over the eye in a way that looks as though it would block your baby’s vision, your baby may be developing 
, which is also known as “lazy eye.” Sometimes amblyopia can result if your baby has crossed eyes for longer than the first three months of life. One eye becomes stronger than the other, leading to blurring or a loss of vision in the weaker eye. Your eye care professional may treat this condition by placing an eye patch over the stronger eye for an extended period – from weeks to months – to strengthen the weaker eye.
Milky white covering over the pupil
Normally, babies are born with a transparent lens in each eye. The lens focuses objects on the retina, and it brings objects into focus, making it possible for the eye to see, Instead of a transparent lens, some babies are born with a milky white lens, which is too cloudy to focus on objects. This condition is called 
. Cataracts in newborn babies should be addressed as early as possible, preferably within the first three months of life, because obstructed vision can prevent important stages of their development. Left untreated congenital cataracts may cause "lazy eye" or amblyopia.
   The surgical procedure for cataracts in babies is much like it is for adults, involving the removal of the affected lens in the eye. After cataract surgery, your baby will need glasses or contact lenses to see before a permanent intraocular lens is implanted. Since it is difficult for a baby to wear glasses on a daily basis, many doctors choose contact lenses as a more practical solution for babies after cataract surgery. Your doctor may choose to use 
 contact lenses for aphakic which are designed for children who have had cataract surgery where an intraocular lens has not been implanted. 
If your baby’s eyes have yellowish or greenish discharge and are red and irritated, he or she may have a common condition called 
, or conjunctivitis. Pink eye can come from many causes, but it generally is the result of a bacterial or viral infection. In some cases, it may come from allergies, environmental chemicals, or passed on from a mother to child during childbirth. The underlying cause of pink eye will determine the course of treatment so talk to your baby's doctor.  
If your baby’s eyes seem to jump, vibrate back and forth, or move erratically in a way that looks unusual to you, he or she may have 
. This condition may signal that the eyes’ motor system is not developing normally. If you have a relative with nystagmus, or if you have it yourself, it’s possible that your baby could develop this as well – so it’s important to tell your pediatrician or eye doctor during your baby’s first eye examination if nystagmus runs in your family. 
The American Nystagmus Network
If your baby’s eyes seem to water all the time, whether the baby is crying or cheerful, your child may have 
 – a condition known as congenital stenosis. You may see crusting or discharge around the eye, especially first thing in the morning.
   Many infants are born with a membrane in the tear duct that may not open, or is too narrow to allow the passage of tears. This is not uncommon, and in most cases will resolve by age 1. However, if it lasts beyond age 1, a minor, generally painless surgical procedure can be performed to open the duct. Generally, there’s no treatment required, babies outgrow this in their first year.
Very rarely, a baby will be born with 
Babies with glaucoma exhibit some behavioral and physical signs that you may recognize as unusual. Often, these babies don’t like bright lights or sunshine. Their eyes may tear more than normal, and one eye may look larger than the other. Also, the eyes may bulge, a symptom known as buphthalmos, or “ox eyes.”
Are Premature Babies at More Risk for Eye Issues?
Premature babies’ eyes may develop more slowly than babies who are delivered at full term. Be sure to tell your eye care professional if your baby was premature, because in some cases, premature babies can have

Fact: just about everyone over age 60 needs some sort of vision correction. It’s just a normal, natural part of aging. The good news? You have several options to maintain your vision for years to come. 
, which is the inability to see clearly at near distances, like when reading. To correct your vision, you’re probably familiar with bifocals or readers. But you may not be aware that contact lenses for presbyopia are available.

 lens is an artificial lens implant that can treat both a person's cataracts and presbyopia—the clouding or hardening of your lenses, and the loss of near and intermediate vision, respectively. Like a natural lens, this artificial lens implant uses the eye muscle to flex and accommodate in order to focus on objects in the environment at all distances. 
If you’ve always worn eyeglasses and you’d prefer to continue doing so, you have many choices. Reading glasses or readers may help. There are also options with bifocal, trifocal and progressive eyeglass lenses. 
Reading the newspaper, doing embroidery, building models, and seeing the numbers on small technical instruments can become challenging as we age. Brighter lighting can help with close-up work, but sometimes you need additional help.

regular eye exam is the best way to protect your eyesight—and an easy precaution to take. It is particularly important if you notice a change in your vision, if your eye is injured in 
 way, or if you have a family history of eye disease. Regardless, you should have an eye exam at least every two years; problems could develop without any signs or symptoms. 
Your eyes can be a window to your overall health. Many illnesses can be detected during a comprehensive eye exam; diabetes, high blood pressure, autoimmune diseases, sexually transmitted diseases and cancers are examples. During your eye exam, your eye care professional has an unobstructed view of blood vessels, nerves and connecting tissue and abnormalities spotted in the eye may signal the same abnormalities in other parts of the body.

Be sure to talk to your eye care professional if you have any questions.

There’s so much for your little one to see and experience during their first years. And while the eye's greatest physical development occurs during the first year, children continue to hone their 
 throughout childhood. Eye muscles strengthen. Nerve connections multiply. And your child’s eyes become stronger and work together more effectively.  
Between the ages of one and three, coordination between eyes, hands, and body allow children to pick up objects, walk or run from place to place, and throw and catch a ball. You will even see the refinement as their hand/eye coordination improves.
Preschoolers - ages two to five - are eager to draw and look at pictures. By connecting stories with illustrations, you can help coordinate your child's hearing and vision.
There are lots of activities and games you can do with your child to help them develop the connection between eyesight and interaction with their world:
Coloring with crayons or markers
Throwing and catching a ball or bean bag
Looking at and identifying pictures on a page while someone reads to them
The best way to help keep your child's eyes healthy is through

balanced diet can make the difference in everyone's overall health and wellness. Knowing which foods contain the nutrients that may promote eye health can help you start making these choices as part of your family's diet. Fruits, vegetables, nuts, and fish contain key antioxidants and nutrients such as vitamin C, vitamin, E, zinc, omega-3 fatty acids, and lutein, which are linked to eye health.

40s and 50s Eye Exams
Regular eye exams become more important as you reach your 40s and 50s. If you have worn eye glasses or contact lenses, you'll want to keep up with the changes in your vision by updating your prescription, but you also want to be certain there’s no vision problem beginning to develop. Some of these problems may not have physical symptoms until they’re advanced. You should have eye exams at least every two years (or more frequently based on the recommendation of your eye doctor) once you’ve reached 40 – and these exams are even more important if you have high blood pressure, diabetes or a family history of eye disease.
 What Can You Expect at Your Eye Exam? 
Each eye doctor has his or her own routine, but most eye exams follow a similar pattern and by now you should be familiar with how it works. Your eye doctor will review your personal and family medical history to see if you may be at special risk for eye problems. Then, your doctor will conduct tests to check for:
. While you look at an eye chart, the doctor will measure your vision precisely, and, if necessary, determine a prescription for corrective lenses. 
 - The doctor will move a light in a set pattern to test your ability to use both eyes together. 
 - The doctor will move an object at the edge of your field of vision to make sure you can see it. 
 - The doctor will shine a light in your eye and watch the pupil's reaction. 
 - The doctor will ask you to describe figures in a series of illustrations made up of numerous colored dots or circles. This tests your ability to differentiate colors. 
 - The doctor will examine your eyelid, inside and out. 
The interior and back of the eye
 - After dilating your eyes (by both using a few eye drops and dimming the lights so the pupils will widen), your eye doctor will use an instrument called an ophthalmoscope to see through to the retina and optic nerve at the back of the eye. This is where clues to many eye diseases first show up. 
 - Your eye doctor will measure the pressure inside your eyes using a tonometer. High pressure may be an early indicator of 
 What Can Do to Self-Monitor My Vision Between Professional Visits? 
One way to self-monitor between professional visits is by looking at an Amsler grid. This is a pattern that resembles a checkerboard with a dot in the center. While staring at the dot, you may notice that the straight lines in the pattern appear wavy. Or you may notice that some of the lines are missing. Print and take the quick vision test using the 
Do the test with each eye separately by covering the eye that’s not being tested. 
Hold the test grid directly in front of you, about 14 inches from your face, and look at the dot in the center of the grid, not at the lines. 
While looking at the dot, all the lines, both vertical and horizontal, should appear straight and unbroken. 
If any of the straight lines appear wavy, or you notice that some of the lines seem to be missing, note their location on the grid for future reference and contact your eye doctor.
Remember, this test is not meant to replace your regularly scheduled eye examinations. The best way to detect and monitor for conditions affecting the macula is for your eye care professional to use special instruments to examine the back of the eye.

40s and 50s Eyes
Even in the womb babies can tell the difference between light and dark. And at birth, they see shapes by following the lines where light and dark meet. Yet, they are several weeks old before they can see their first primary color – red.
In their first weeks and months, babies learn to use their eyes – actually their eyes “learn” how to see. While each eye has the 
 it needs to begin to see normally, the two eyes haven’t learned to work together yet – and this “binocular vision” develops quickly throughout the first few weeks and months of life. 
In this critical first year, your baby’s brain and eyes begin to coordinate images and remember what they’ve seen. As a parent, you can participate in your newborn’s eye development and health as a normal part of your time with your baby. Proper stimulation can increase curiosity, attention span, memory, and nervous system development. So be sure to give your baby plenty of interesting things to see.
 The First Three Months of Eye Development 
Newborns can only focus about eight to 12 inches from their face, and they see only black, white and gray. As early as the first week, your baby begins to respond to movement and begins to focus on your face. Soon your baby will smile when you come close. This is an important sign that your baby sees and recognizes you – a joyful moment for any parent.
Over the next ten to 12 weeks, you will notice your baby following moving objects and recognizing things, especially toys and mobiles with bold, geometric patterns. As their color vision begins to develop, babies will see red first – they will see the full spectrum of colors by the time they reach five months of age.
Depth perception and eye-hand coordination begin to develop when infants reach approximately five months. From four to six months, your baby begins to reach out and touch an object – something that previously only happened by chance.
You've probably heard the term 20/20 vision which is typically thought of as “normal” visual acuity. By six months of age your child’s visual acuity is around 20/100. Your child won’t reach adult levels of visual acuity until they are age 4 or 5. You’ll see how eyesight becomes a crucial element in your baby’s ability to coordinate full-body movements such as standing and walking.
 When Does a Baby's Hand Eye Coordination Develop? 
From 8 to 12 months, the connection between eyes, movement, and memory is strong as your baby approaches his or her first birthday. In the past year you’ve probably noticed tremendous improvements in your baby’s attempts to roll a ball, pick up small toys and objects, and feed themselves foods like cereal or sliced fruit.
Activities that encourage hand-eye coordination, like playing with stacking boxes and rings, blocks or snap-together toys, will help strengthen your baby’s ability to see an object, touch it, and remember things about it.
The best way to help keep your baby's eyes healthy is through 
. So have your baby's eyes examined – by your pediatrician or a licensed eye doctor – shortly after birth.
According to a study published in the January 2007 issue of American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, “babies who are breast-fed have significantly better vision as young children than babies fed from formula.” Because scientists have previously hypothesized that the chemical known as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) – found in higher concentrations in breast milk than in formula – enhances the vision of developing children, the researchers randomly added to the formulas of some of the non-breast-fed children.

40s and 50s Eyes
Most people know their eyesight is precious, but at this age you might not think as much about protecting your eyes as you should. Help protect your eyes by taking proactive measures to ensure the quality of eyesight you currently enjoy. Eye injuries can occur during activities like yard work, cleaning or while playing sports. In most cases of injury, people report not properly protecting their eyes. Taking proper precautions such as wearing goggles or safety glasses with side shields can help prevent eye injuries.
If your eye is injured you should get immediate medical attention. 
Two common places for eye injuries to occur are home and work. Often, people in industrial settings are susceptible to projectiles that can injure the eye. And at home, many household cleaners can cause injury to the eyes – in addition to various home improvement projects that have a potential for danger. The best advice we can give is to use your common sense – if you’re working on a project that can cause harm to your eyes, make sure you’re safe with the proper protective eyewear.
Wearing the right protective eyewear may help to prevent 90 percent of eye injuries. Many goggles or safety glasses come with tints to reduce sun glare, light-filtering capabilities that make it easier to see certain colors (like yellow tennis balls), and polycarbonate lenses that stand up to sudden, sharp impact. Be sure to wear appropriate eye protection based on the activity or sport you are doing. 
If your eye is injured, it’s tempting to think you can just flush it out with some cold water and it will be fine. However, it’s not easy to judge the extent or severity of any eye injury, so you should 
 Here are some steps you can take in the event of an eye injury (these tips are not meant to replace professional medical attention).: 
 If you are hit in the eye, rest a protective shield – such as a Styrofoam cup – on the bone around your eye. Make sure there is no pressure on the eye itself. Seek immediate, professional medical attention. 
 If an object has entered your eye, do not try to remove it; you may tear delicate tissue or force the object in deeper. Rest a protective shield – again, like a Styrofoam cup – on the bone around your eye, making sure there is no pressure on the eye itself. Seek immediate professional medical attention.
 If you are hit in the eye area, place an ice pack or cold cloth over your eye. Even in cases where trauma seems minor, every eye injury should be given medical attention. Get immediate, professional medical attention.
 If your eye has sustained a chemical burn, rinse it with fresh water for at least 20 to 30 minutes. Hold your head under the tap or use a clean container to pour water into your eye. As you rinse, use your fingers to hold your eye open as wide as possible and roll your eye to ensure the greatest possible coverage. Get immediate, professional medical attention.
Sunglasses not only look good, they help protect your eyes from harmful ultra violet (UV) rays to help prevent long-term damage. Choose sunglasses with both and protection, to block both forms of ultraviolet rays. hat or baseball cap may help block indirect sun, which can come into the eyes around the edges of sunglasses.
Tanning beds may lead to serious eye damage. Tanning beds can produce levels up to 100x what you would get from the sun causing serious damage to the eye and eyelids.

40s and 50s Eye Concerns
regular eye exam is the best way to protect your eyesight—it is particularly important if you notice a change in your vision, if your eye is injured in any way, or if you have a family history of eye disease. In your 40s and 50s, you should have an eye exam at least every two years (or as recommended by your eye care professional); problems could develop without any signs or symptoms.
Your eyes can be a window to your overall health. Many illnesses can be detected during a comprehensive eye exam; diabetes, high blood pressure, autoimmune diseases, sexually transmitted diseases and cancers are examples. During your eye exam, your eye care professional has an unobstructed view of blood vessels, nerves and connective tissue. Abnormalities spotted in the eye may signal abnormalities in other parts of the body.
Generally, changes in your vision now are just a factor of aging. Here are some things you might experience: 
. This condition is caused by abnormally high pressure inside your eye – and it often does not show symptoms until damage to your vision has begun. Your eye care professional will examine your eyes for glaucoma at your annual eye exam. While there’s no cure for this, early detection and treatment may save your vision.
If your vision seems dim or you’re having trouble reading, watching television, or just seeing what’s around you – even when you’re wearing your glasses or contact lenses – you may have 
 in one or both eyes. Most of us will develop cataracts as we age because our eyes’ lenses become more and more opaque as we get older. Cataracts can be corrected by your ophthalmologist, who can replace your eye’s lens with a clear plastic intraocular lens (IOL).
 Lens is an artificial lens implant that can treat both a person's cataracts and presbyopia —the clouding or hardening of your lenses, and the loss of near and intermediate vision, respectively.
The effects of age-related macular degeneration (amd) in its early stages often go unnoticed. In amd, the macula, the part of your retina that’s responsible for central vision, deteriorates and creates a blind spot in the middle of your field of vision. is the leading cause of vision loss in people over 50, but it progresses slowly. Your eye doctor will check for this disease during your annual eye examination.
 Floating Spots and Flashes of Light 
We all see spots, specks, and other things that look like dark bits of string floating in our eyes on occasion. These are actually cells and fibers in the vitreous, gel-like part of your eye. Generally, these floaters are infrequent and just a normal part of vision. If you suddenly see more floaters than normal, and they’re accompanied by bright, flashing lights, the floaters may be a warning sign of an impending 
 – an actual tear between the vitreous part of the eye and the retina. If left untreated, this tear can expand and lead to a serious loss of vision. See your eye care professional immediately if you experience any of these symptoms.
While regular eye examinations and early diagnosis of eye disease can save much of your vision, in some cases, you may already have incurred some vision loss before you see your doctor and begin treatment. This is commonly called low vision, a condition that can’t be corrected with eye glasses, contact lenses, or surgery. There are many products and devices such as 
 that can help people with low vision. In addition, some eye care professionals specialize in rehabilitation for low vision, so ask your eye doctor for recommendations.
If you have type-1 or type-2 diabetes, it’s important to have your eyes examined every year to check for a condition called 
. High blood sugar and hypertension (high blood pressure) can damage the tiny blood vessels that lead to your retina. This painless condition often has no symptoms – until it’s serious. But regular visits to your eye care professional may detect it in its early stages. Diabetic retinopathy can be controlled and treated, and its progress slowed significantly if detected before you experience vision loss.
If you suffer from red, watery, itchy eyes, ask your doctor about 
 diagnostic test. The FDA-approved in-office Doctor’s Allergy Formula diagnostic test enables eye care professionals to test for allergies that may be the underlying cause of your eye allergies or irritations.
 is extreme dryness of the eyes, mouth, throat, and other areas of the body sustained over prolonged periods of time. It is a condition that affects four million people in the U.S., including men and women of all ages. The most common patients are women in their ’40s and ’50s. An eye care professional may diagnose Sjögren’s syndrome after observing dryness of the eyes and mouth, and running tests to detect the presence of the condition.

Good vision helps you perform well—at home, at work, or behind the wheel. That’s why it’s important to take a few simple steps to make sure you help keep your eyesight at its best. regular 
 is the best way to protect your eyesight – and an easy precaution to take. Here are some tips to help maintain eye health as you age.
As part of your healthy diet, choose foods rich in antioxidants, like Vitamins and C; foods like leafy, green vegetables and fish.  Many foods – especially fatty fish, such as salmon – contain essential omega-3 fatty acids that are important to the health of the macula, the part of the eye responsible for central vision.
An inadequate intake of antioxidants, consumption of alcohol or saturated fats may create free-radical reactions that can harm the macula – the central part of the retina. High-fat diets can also cause deposits that constrict blood flow in the arteries. The eyes are especially sensitive to this, given the small size of the blood vessels that feed them.
Your eyes are unique, and have their own set of nutritional needs. 
 eye vitamins are specially designed to provide a balanced combination of nutrients dedicated to the health of your eyes.* Visit 
Exercise improves blood circulation, which improves oxygen levels to the eyes and the removal of toxins.
You’ll feel the difference when you get the sleep you need. You’ll look great, you’ll perform at home or work—and good rest will support the health of your eyes.
Keeping your hands clean is so important when it comes to your eyes, especially if you’re a contact lens wearer. Before you touch your eye—and before you put in or remove a contact lens—wash your hands with a mild soap and dry with a lint-free towel. Some germs and bacteria that come from your hands can cause eye infections, like bacterial 
rubbing their eyes while they have cold virus germs on their hands.
Smoking exposes your eyes to high levels of oxidative stress. While the connection has not been clearly identified, it is known that smoking increases your risk for a variety of health conditions affecting the eye. To help you quit, visit the American Lung Association’s free online smoking cessation program – Freedom From Smoking Online – at 
To protect your eyes from harmful ultraviolet (UV) light, choose sunglasses with both and protection. Also, wearing a hat with a brim will greatly reduce the amount of radiation slipping around the side of your sunglasses.
You're probably using digital devices for hours each day at work and at home. These devices are exposing your eyes to high energy blue light. It's called blue light because the wavelengths emitted are near the bluer part of the spectrum. Lutein Zeaxanthin are eye nutrients that are concentrated in the macula and help filter blue light.* Lutein and Zeaxanthin cannot be produced by our bodies on their own, so they must be obtained through diet and/or supplements. If you don't think you're getting enough in your diet, visit 
Adjust lighting to minimize glare on the screen.
Take a break every 20 minutes to focus on an object 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

Contact lenses are a medical device which require a prescription … even if they are not for vision correction. 
When you have an eye exam, your eye care professional will assess the health of your eyes and also check for nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), and astigmatism. While you look at an eye chart, your eye care professional will measure your vision precisely, and, if necessary, determine a prescription for corrective lenses.
If corrective lenses are needed, it’s also a matter of determining if you’re “ready” for contacts. This may not be based on any sort of age guidelines – only your willingness to care for and wear lenses properly. If you feel you will be able to responsibly wear and care for your lenses, then talk to your parents about setting up an appointment with your eye care professional to discuss options. It’s up to you and your parents and your eye care professional to determine if you’re ready for this responsibility.
Contact lenses are designed for specific wearing times. Depending on what’s best for your eyes, your eye care professional may recommend a lens designed for daily replacement, or a lens designed for frequent/planned replacement.
 - the contact lens is discarded after each removal
 - the contact lens is cleaned, rinsed and disinfected each time it is removed from the eye and discarded after the recommended wearing period prescribed by the eye care professional. 
It’s really important to follow the replacement schedule your eye care professional gave you – it tells you when you need new lenses. Following it will help keep your eyes healthy and comfortable – so make sure you stick to it.
 What Makes a Great First Contact Lens? 
Many eye care professionals recommend daily disposable contact lenses for first-time teen wearers. Daily disposable lenses are worn once and thrown away. Talk to your eye care professional about what is best for your eye care needs; they will determine the best prescription and as long as you follow a proper wear and care regimen, you will likely succeed.

To be competitive on the playing field you need peak performance from your entire body – and your eyes are no exception. Sports vision is "full-scope," and primary eye care may help you optimize these three key visual skills:
 lets you see fine details from a distance – like the subtle contours of a golf course.
 keeps your vision as clear when you're running as when you're standing, so you can see every obstacle.
 keeps a ball in sharp focus as it moves toward or away from you.
Every sport has unique demands: depth perception, peripheral vision, eye-hand coordination. And every sport poses unique challenges: glare, wind, haze, and close encounters with moving objects. To win, you need to conquer them all.
Discover which visual skills may be critical for your sport. Find your sport. Then check out what visual skills you may need and why.
 baseball's size and color, combined with the varying light conditions during play, present special issues. Players need clear, stable vision; peripheral awareness; image size accuracy; and perceptual accuracy.
 From measuring true water depth to reading detailed radar screens, boating demands clear stable vision. Glare protection against the sun is also critical; use maximum ultraviolet protection.
 Cyclers maintain an unusual head/eye position, yet need to read detailed information from instruments and maps at a glance. This requires dynamic acuity and contrast sensitivity. Eye protection against wind and debris is also important.
 Strong eye-hand, body-foot coordination, and clear stable vision are imperative to maintain stability.
 Good near vision for tying a line and dynamic acuity to see well while looking downward in a moving boat are required.
 The constant judgment of distance, roll of the green, and alignments requires overall visual acuity; the game also demands superb eye-hand coordination.
 At high altitudes hikers get less oxygen and more ultraviolet light, so they should always use maximum ultraviolet protection.
 Players need a constant awareness of their spatial relationship to opponents and the puck – under dynamic conditions. This requires acuity, focus flexibility, and depth perception. Eye protection is highly recommended for this aggressive sport.
 Runners have distant focal points and need good dynamic visual acuity. They often must deal with wind and debris.
 Snow, wind, cold, and bright light combine with low oxygen and intense ultraviolet exposure under dynamic conditions to create a host of demands. Use maximum ultraviolet protection.
 Sharp ice chips can cause serious injury without the proper eye protection.
 For efficient turning, swimmers need clear stable vision. Always use swim goggles to minimize eye irritation. Remember to remove your contact lenses before swimming; prescription goggles are available, if needed.
 Special challenges include prolonged visual concentration and the need to detect the ball's movement instantly. That takes sharp visual acuity, dynamic acuity, and focus flexibility. Be sure to use eye protection.
 are ideal for athletes. They offer a more natural vision correction option than eyeglasses. Contact lenses can increase peripheral vision. Contact lenses do not take the place of protective eyewear for sports. Protective eyewear is a necessity while playing sports. Ordinary prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses do not provide adequate protection - protective eyewear should be sport-specific.
You should remove your contact lenses before swimming; prescription goggles are available, if needed.

We normally don't think about all of the visual skills that make up good vision. And good vision helps your kids perform well—in play, in school and on the ball field. Here are some of the visual skills you may notice your child continuing to hone in on throughout their childhood.
 - moving both eyes together to accomplish a goal like following a ball or reading
 - seeing an object clearly at a far distance
- keeping an object in the far distance clear
 - seeing an object clearly up close  
 - aligning both eyes on a far object
 - keeping both eyes aligned on a far object
 - aligning both eyes on an object up close
Sustaining alignment at near 
- keeping both eyes aligned on an object up close
- seeing what's on the side of you when eyes are looking straight
 - ability to determine distance of objects
 - ability to tell colors apart
 - small movements that require eye-hand accuracy from your vision; writing, coloring
 - the ability to understand what you are seeing (not 
 you see it - that's visual acuity)
 - coordinating visual skills with gross and fine motor skills
If you ever have a concern about your child's vision development, schedule an appointment with your pediatrician or eye doctor.

40s and 50s Eyes
Presbyopia is something that usually occurs around age 40, even if you’ve never had a vision problem before. You may start to experience blurry vision when reading or looking at your smartphone. Then, focusing between distances can become more difficult. 
In young people, the eye’s lens is soft and flexible, readily changing shape to see images from different distances. As you age, the crystalline lens in your eye hardens and loses elasticity. With this loss of flexibility, your eyes are less able to adjust properly to focus near objects.
People commonly mistake the symptoms of presbyopia for farsightedness. However, the two conditions have different causes: farsightedness is a result of a refractive error that occurs when the shape of the eye focuses light beyond the retina instead of on it, whereas presbyopia is due to the loss of flexibility in the lens.
The telltale symptom of presbyopia is blurred vision while reading, sewing, using a cell phone, or doing anything that requires near vision. You may also experience headaches, eye strain, or a tired feeling when doing things that require near vision.
There are many options for people with presbyopia, including contact lenses. 
Common options for presbyopia include:
Bifocal, trifocal or progressive eyeglasses
Contact lenses: + Multi-Focal contact lenses are designed to provide clear vision—up close, far away and in between. These lenses feature the 
 design that eases the transitions eyes have to make from near to far distance. Talk to your eye care professional to see if 
 contact lenses are right for you.
 Lens is an artificial lens implant that can treat both a person's cataracts and presbyopia—the clouding or hardening of your lenses, and the loss of near and intermediate vision, respectively. Like the natural lens, it is a lens implant that uses the eye muscle to flex and accommodate in order to focus on objects in the environment at all distances.

The best chance to help safe-guard your vision is to detect issues early with regular eye examinations. Between examinations, if you notice a change in your vision, or your eyes are injured in any way, contact your eye doctor as soon as possible. Remember, if you are over 60 years old, you should have an eye exam every year. Eye health may also be maintained by exercise, diet, rest and other healthy habits. 
Nutrition is a Key Component of Eye Health
As part of an eye-healthy diet, choose foods rich in antioxidants, like vitamins and C, such as leafy, green vegetables and fish. Many foods – especially fatty fish like salmon – contain essential omega-3 fatty acids that are important to the health of the macula, the part of the eye responsible for central vision.
An inadequate intake of antioxidants, as well as over consumption of alcohol and saturated fats may create free-radical reactions that can harm the macula. diet high in fats may also cause deposits that constrict blood flow in the arteries. 
Studies indicate that proper nutrition is important to help maintain eye health. As we age, our eyes may not get enough nutrition through diet alone.
 help replenish vital nutrients your eyes can lose as you age.* This is our most advanced formula to help support eye health, with Lutein, Zeaxanthin and Omega-3.* The easy to swallow MiniGels use a highly purified fish oil and are 25% smaller than the original soft gels.
Smoking exposes your eyes to high levels of oxidative stress. While the connection has not been clearly identified, it’s a fact that smoking increases your risk of developing a variety of conditions that affect eye health. For help with quitting, visit the American Lung Association’s free online smoking cessation program – Freedom From Smoking® Online – at 
Exercise is important because it improves blood circulation, which, in turn, improves oxygen levels to the eyes and the removal of toxins. Walking, yoga and stretching and breathing, can be effective ways to exercise to help stay healthy.
Being outdoors on a sunny day feels wonderful – but it can be tough on your eyes. The solution? Wear sunglasses that block harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Also, a hat with a wide brim will reduce the amount of radiation slipping around the side of your sunglasses.
Spending more time on the computer? Here are a few tips to help reduce the impact of computer eyestrain:
Minimize the distance between your computer screen and any documents you need to reference while working
Adjust lighting to minimize glare on the screen
Take a break every 15 minutes to focus on a distant object
 get immediate, professional medical attention. It’s simply the best way to safeguard your vision.

Astigmatism, which can occur with myopia or hyperopia, is a condition in which the light entering the eye is not refracted (or bent) equally in all directions. Due to diffences in the curvature of the cornea or lens of the eye, the light has two focal points from two axes often causing blurred near and distance vision. 
What Causes Astigmatism?
Light entering the eye is not focused on a single point on the retina, so objects both near and far become blurred or distorted producing an effect similar to looking through a pane of wavy glass.This curvation may be inherited or as a result of an eye injury or surgery. 
Symptoms of Astigmatism
An eye care professional may diagnose astigmatism through a variety of tests, including a simple vision test, light refraction test, cornea measurement, or electronically mapping the surface of the eye. Common symptoms of astigmatism include:
Difficulty driving at night
Treatments for Astigmatism
Since astigmatism occurs from the uneven distribution of light rays, it's corrected when light rays are focused on a single plane. This may be done in a number of ways:
Contact lenses for Astigmatism: contact lenses uniquely designed to meet the special vision correction needs of people with astigmatism. If you have astigmatism, ask your eye care professional about

, such as bifocals or multifocal contact lenses, for reading.
You may start to experience blurry vision when reading or looking at your devices and focusing between distances can become more difficult.  That's because as you age, the crystalline lens in your eye hardens and loses elasticity. With this loss of flexibility, your eyes are less able to adjust properly to focus near objects making it tougher for your eyes to focus with the same agility you experienced in younger years. This is called

Your eye’s lens may start to change or discolor as you age. The lens in your eye is normally clear, as you age, it may discolor or get cloudy making it harder to see colors with the same vibrancy you once enjoyed. You may also notice additional glare from headlights at night, or from the sun hitting the pavement during the day due to the way light enters your your eye as your eye's lens changes.
 Tear Glands Lose Some Ability to Produce Moisture
Have you noticed your eyes feeling drier than normal? This may be because your tear glands have lost some ability to produce moisture and keep your eyes properly lubricated. Certain medications, and for women, hormonal changes as you are nearing menopause may also cause eye dryness.

Vitreous Gel Thickens as We Age
The vitreous gel thickens and shrinks as we age, sometimes forming tiny clumps in the vitrous. These clumps cast shadows onto the retina, and the resulting forms and shapes are referred to as

Floaters are most often isolated occurrences that are a perfectly normal part of vision. If they become more frequent, however, and are accompanied by eye flashes – bursts or streaks of light – this may be a sign of an impending retinal detachment. This is very serious and should be brought to the attention of an eye care professional.

regular eye exam is the best way to protect your eyesight. It is particularly important if you notice a change in your vision, if your eye is injured in any way, or if you have a family history of eye disease. You should have an eye exam at least every two years. Remember, problems may develop without any signs or symptoms. 
Your 20/20 vision may come with the help of glasses or contact lenses. Regardless, if you’re doing the right things to help maintain good health, your eyesight can stay at the same level for a decade or more.You probably already know if you’re nearsighted, farsighted or if you have astigmatism. These are common vision issues that may have been discovered when you were in your teens or younger. At this age you may have more vision correction options than eyeglasses and contact lenses.  
Contact lenses are designed for specific wearing times. Depending on what’s best for your eyes, your eye care professional may recommend a lens designed for daily replacement, or frequent/planned replacement. It’s really important to follow the replacement schedule your eye care professional gave you – it tells you when you need new lenses. Following it will help keep your eyes healthy and comfortable – so make sure you stick to it.

You may consider laser surgery for vision correction at this age (generally laser surgery is not considered for anyone under 18). Typical vision problems, such as mild to moderate farsightedness, nearsightedness, or astigmatism may be corrected with laser vision correction. If you are interested in this option, talk to your eye care professional to see if you may be a good candidate.

One of the oldest continually operating companies in the today, + traces its roots to 1853, when John Jacob Bausch, a German immigrant, set up a tiny optical goods shop in Rochester, New York. When he needed more money to keep the business going, borrowed $60 from his good friend, Henry Lomb. promised that if the business grew, would be made a full partner. The business did grow and the partnership was formed.
In the early years, + manufactured revolutionary rubber eyeglass frames as well as a variety of optical products that required a high degree of manufacturing precision. By 1903, the firm had been issued patents for microscopes, binoculars, and even a camera shutter based on the eye’s reaction to light...
In the 1900’s, + continued to demonstrate its place at the forefront of technological innovation for optical products. + produced the first optical quality glass made in America, developed ground-breaking sunglasses for the military in World War I, and created the lenses used on the cameras that took the first satellite pictures of the moon. In 1971, + introduced the first soft contact lenses and is still the largest global provider of eye care products.
Although products and times have changed, + still adheres to the legacy of dedication to innovation, quality, and craftsmanship established by John Jacob and Henry Lomb.

It is important that your eyes stay healthy because you’ll need good vision for just about every activity you choose—and you want to keep your 20/20 vision for many years to come. Good vision helps you perform well—on the ball field, in class, behind the wheel or at your desk.  That’s why it’s important to take a few simple steps to make sure you help keep your eyesight at its best.
Just like you visit the dentist to maintain your teeth, the best protection for your vision is through regular professional eye examinations.  You may be at risk for eye problems if there is a family history of eye disease.  Of course, if you notice a change in your vision —or your eye is injured in any way— you should contact your eye care professional.
What Can Do To Help My Eyes?
There are many things you can do to help 
 and maintain eye health during your teen years. Eating the right foods, not smoking, limiting your computer time, and wearing protective eye wear during sports are important things you can do.  Learn more: 
Eat foods rich in antioxidants and essential fatty acids.
  healthy balanced diet containing a wide selection of fruits, nuts, and crunchy vegetables are important for healthy eyes.
 - An unhealthy diet high in fat can cause deposits that constrict blood flow in the arteries. The eyes are especially sensitive to this, given the small size of the blood vessels that feed them. 
, which improves oxygen levels to the eyes and the removal of toxins.
.  It’s tough to fit everything into your schedule, but you’ll feel the difference when you get the sleep you need.  You’ll look great, you’ll perform better in class and on the go—and good rest will support the health of your eyes.
Keeping your hands clean becomes more important than ever when it comes to your eyes, especially if you’re a contact lens wearer. When you touch your eye, whatever is on your fingers goes right onto your eye’s surface.  This is one way that people catch colds, by rubbing their eyes while they have cold virus germs on their hands.
Some germs and bacteria that come from your hands can cause eye infections, like bacterial 
. Before you touch your eye—and especially before you put in or remove a contact lens—wash your hands with a mild soap and dry with a lint-free towel.
Here are some simple rules to help you keep your eyes safe while you’re working on your look.
If you wear contact lenses, be sure to put them in 
 applying your make-up, to avoid contaminating your lenses with the residue from foundation or powder on your fingers.  Of course, it’s also much easier to apply your make-up when you can see clearly! 
Lotions, powders and gels with bits of glitter look cool—but those tiny, shiny specks can get into your eyes and cause irritation and problems with your contact lenses.  After applying glittery gel, be careful not to touch your eyes—and wash the glitter off your hands right away.
You’re probably doing most class assignments on a computer, looking at the screen for hours at a stretch. Once your homework is done, you might be texting friends, chatting on facebook, or watching YouTube videos. Maybe you’re you’re watching or playing computer games on your gaming system.
All of these things take a toll on your eyes—and maybe you’ve already noticed that your eyes feel dry and gritty by the end of the day.
Adjust lighting to minimize glare on the screen.
Take a break every 20 minutes to focus on an object 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

Maintaining Healthy Eyes in Your 40s and 50s
Good vision is vital for just about every activity you choose—and you want to keep your vision for many years to come. It may surprise you that one in six adults age 45 and older has some type of eye problem that threatens their sight.
There are things you can do to help protect your eyes as you age to help maintain good vision for years to come.
An important way to help protect your vision is with regular professional eye examinations. You may be at risk for eye problems if you have diabetes or high blood pressure or if there is a family history of eye disease, diabetes, high blood pressure or poor vision. In between examinations, if you notice a change in your vision or your eye is injured in any way, contact your eye doctor.
Many non-sight related illnesses can be detected during your comprehensive 
; diabetes, high blood pressure, autoimmune diseases, sexually transmitted diseases and many forms of cancer are some examples. During your exam, your eye care professional has an unobstructed view of many parts of your eye and may identify any abnormalities that may signal additional problems in other parts of your body. You should have an eye exam at least every two years; problems could develop without any signs or symptoms. 
How Important is Nutrition to Eye Health?
Research indicates proper nutrition is critical in helping maintain and preserve eye health for both men and women. As part of a healthy diet, choose foods rich in antioxidants, like vitamins and C; foods like leafy, green vegetables; and fish. Many foods – especially fatty fish, such as salmon – contain essential omega-3 fatty acids that are important to the health of the macula, the part of the eye responsible for central vision.
An inadequate intake of antioxidants and consumption of alcohol and saturated fats may create free-radical reactions that can harm the macula. diet high in fat can also cause deposits that constrict blood flow in the arteries.
Many people do not get the recommended amounts of many important eye nutrients through diet alone. 
 eye vitamins are specifically designed to provide a balanced combination of nutrients dedicated to the health of your eyes.* Visit Ocuvite.com to learn more.
Exercise improves blood circulation, which improves oxygen levels to the eyes and helps remove toxins.
You’ll feel the difference when you get the sleep you need. You’ll look great, you’ll perform better at home or work—and good rest will help support the health of your eyes. You need at least 7 hours of sleep; sticking to a schedule, avoiding caffeine, and avoiding the use of devices such as cell phones before bedtime are some tips that may help you succeed in getting a good night's sleep. 
Being outdoors in the sun can feel wonderful – but it can be tough on your eyes. Fortunately, there's an easy solution: sunglasses. Be sure to choose a pair that can block harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. Also, a hat with a wide brim will reduce the amount of radiation slipping around the side of your sunglasses.
Smoking exposes your eyes to high levels of oxidative stress. While the connection to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has not been clearly identified, it is known that smoking increases your risk of developing To help you quit, visit the American Lung Association’s free online smoking cessation program – Freedom From Smoking Online – at 
You're probably using digital devices more and more each day at work and home. These devices are exposing your eyes to high energy blue light. Lutein Zeaxanthin are eye nutrients that are concentrated in the macula and help filter blue light.* Lutein and Zeaxanthin cannot be produced by our bodies on their own, so they must be obtained through diet (green leafy vegetables, such as kale and spinach) and/or supplements. If you don't think you're getting enough in your diet, visit 
Computer images are created from thousands of tiny dots – so there is no distinct image for your eye to focus on. You have to focus and refocus to keep the images sharp. You can help reduce the impact of computer eyestrain by following a few simple rules:
Adjust lighting to minimize glare on the screen
Take a break every 20 minutes to focus on a distant object
If your eye is injured, it may be tempting to think that you can flush it out with some cold water and it will be fine. However, it's not easy to judge the extent or severity of any eye injury, so you should 
 get immediate, professional medical attention—it's the best way to safeguard your vision.

person with nearsightedness can see close objects clearly, but may have trouble seeing objects from a distance – like a road sign, blackboard, or face across the room. It’s a common condition, experts believe that at least 33% of people are nearsighted in the United States.
Nearsightedness or myopia happens when the eye has a long shape, which causes light rays to focus too far in front of the retina, making distance vision difficult.
Like farsightedness, myopia can be inherited. It is often discovered when children are 8 to 12 years old. During the teenage years, when the body is growing rapidly, nearsightedness can get worse. Typically, between ages 20 and 40 there is little change.
An eye care professional can diagnose nearsightedness with a simple eye exam. The most common symptoms of nearsightedness include:
Eye strain or headaches from trying to focus
Treatments for Nearsightedness
Nearsightedness is easily corrected by refocusing the light rays onto the retina of the eye. This is commonly done through:
Eyeglasses and contact lenses: the simplest treatment option chosen by most patients with nearsightedness.
Orthokeratology - an innovative process that uses customized shaping lenses to gently correct your vision while you sleep so you can enjoy clear vision while you’re awake
Surgery: Surgical options are also available. These procedures use laser technology or manual incisions to remove small amounts of tissue from the cornea.

Farsightedness (Hyperopia)
Contrary to what the name implies, a person who is farsighted has blurred vision when looking at close objects, unless they make a constant effort to focus, which can lead to strain, headaches, and eye fatigue.
What is Farsightedness (Hyperopia)?
Farsightedness or hyperopia happens when the eye is shorter than normal. This shape causes images to be focused behind the retina, rather than on it. It is a common condition that most often is inherited. As a result, the lens of the eye must exert effort to focus the image on the retina.
Babies and children are usually slightly farsighted; as their eyes grow and lengthen, the condition typically corrects itself, generally between 5 to 10 years of age. Young adults who remain farsighted often don’t realize their condition because they have enough flexibility in focusing power to correct the condition without the aid of eye glasses or contact lenses.
At first, symptoms may be undetectable or very slight. With age, increased difficulty seeing near objects may be noticed until eventually even distant objects appear blurred.
Since farsightedness occurs when images are focused behind the retina, it is corrected when images are refocused onto the retina. This is usually done with common forms of vision correction, including:
Surgery: Surgical options are available to correct farsightedness, but can be expensive and may involve more risk than corrective eyeglasses or contact lenses. These options use either laser technology or small incisions to reshape the cornea of the affected eye.

One in every four students needs vision correction which may affect learning, personality and adjustment in school, if left untreated. Your child may have already been wearing eye glasses or maybe you are finding out for the first time they need vision correction. If vision correction is needed, contact lenses may be a popular option for your child or teen. The real question is when is the right time to make the switch to contact lenses? 
Contact lenses are a medical device which require a prescription … even if they are not for vision correction. During an eye exam, your eye care professional will assess the health of your child's eyes, check for nearsightedness (myopia), farsightedness (hyperopia), and astigmatism and measure their vision precisely. Then, if necessary, determine a prescription for corrective lenses.
Wearing contact lenses may help teenagers feel more confident in their appearance. Contact lenses are also a great option if your child is involved in sports. This guide is designed to help answer your questions about your child wearing contact lenses.
There’s no “right age” to begin wearing contact lenses — almost anyone of any age can wear them. Studies have shown that children are capable of wearing and caring for lenses. In a study of 484 children, vision-related quality of life benefits were greater for older children, children who participate in recreational activities, children who are motivated to wear contact lenses, and children who do not like their appearance in glasses. But it does involve a level of responsibility and ability to follow a wear-and-care routine. If you feel your child can responsibly care for lenses, then talk to their eye care professional to discuss options.
Contact lenses are designed for specific wearing times. Depending on what’s best for their eyes, your eye care professional may recommend a lens designed for daily replacement, or a lens designed for frequent/planned replacement.
Daily disposable wear contact lenses are discarded after each removal
Frequent/planned replacement contact lenses are cleaned, rinsed and disinfected each time it is removed from the eye and discarded after the recommended wearing period prescribed by the eye care professional. 
It’s important for your child to follow the replacement schedule and lens care instructions from their eye care professional – following it will help keep their eyes healthy and comfortable – so be sure they're ready to stick to it.
 What’s an Ideal Lens for a First-Time Wearer? 
Many eye care professionals recommend daily disposable contact lenses for first-time wearers. Daily disposable lenses are worn once and thrown away. Talk to your eye care professional about what is best for your child's eye care needs; they will determine the best prescription.
