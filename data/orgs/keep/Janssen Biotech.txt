Summer Lights, Cliff Enright
Cliff at work on a new painting.
Cliff with his long-time partner, Virginia, surrounded by his paintings.
As the door opens to Cliff Enright’s Manhattan loft, the vibrant watercolor paintings lining the exposed brick wall explode before you in arresting jeweled hues. The intricate white patterns that speckle the paintings appear both painstakingly deliberate yet playfully chaotic. And the indulgent use of deep, bright colors seems to stem from nothing short of a wellspring of pure joy – a feeling that cannot be shaken long after you’ve seen the works. It is a feeling that stays with you long after you’ve met the artist.
As vibrant and colorful as his paintings, Cliff’s charm and optimism are matched only by the love he has for his craft. An abstract expressionist and art instructor since the 1960s, Cliff came to New York City to pursue his passion. But it was a freak accident in 2004 that would dramatically alter his life and his artwork – but not his resolve.
“was in England visiting friends and went outside to smoke a cigarette,” recalls Cliff. “dropped it. When reached down to pick it up, kept falling forward. felt my chin hit the ground and my head snapped back. tried to get up and couldn’t move.”
The spinal cord injury Cliff suffered that evening a decade ago left him a quadriplegic. He faced a long, difficult road ahead. But with the help of his long-time partner, Virginia, numerous health care professionals and aids, and his artwork, Cliff took on the challenge of rehabilitation with the same dedication and tenacity that he always brought to his work.
“started with art therapy right away. was making just scribbles and scrabbles, but was working in art from the very beginning,” he recalls. “just kept painting, and gradually improving and gradually painting more.”
His willful stubbornness, coupled with a remarkable optimism has helped Cliff recover some mobility and strength in his hands and arms. It has also served him well through other physical and emotional trials along the way.
“It seems to me as both Cliff's friend and his art dealer, that there is nothing that would keep him down,” remarks Robin Glazer, Founder and Director of The Creative Center at University Settlement . “He has had a number of other illnesses besides a spinal cord injury. He's been diagnosed with diabetes and skin cancer, and has gone through treatments and medication trials and all sorts of interventions, and he still keeps working.”
Cliff is among a number of artists represented by The Creative Center at University Settlement, a nonprofit organization dedicated to bringing the creative arts to people living with cancer and other chronic illnesses. Along with free-of-charge art workshops and hospital-based bedside art programs, The Creative Center exhibits and markets the artwork of professional artists living with illness.
Today, with the help of an art assistant, Cliff continues to be a prolific and celebrated artist. His artwork has been exhibited throughout the United States and Canada, and is part of both corporate and private collections around the world.
Of his unabashed use of color, Cliff minces no words: “I’m going to paint the way feel like painting. And that's with as much bright, beautiful color as can get on the painting. If could get more on a painting, would!”

Watching Dennis Frohlich, an assistant professor of mass communications at Bloomsburg University in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania, stroll the school’s leafy campus on the way to class, you’d never suspect his inner pain.
Dennis suffers from ulcerative colitis (UC), part of a group of disorders known collectively as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). It’s a condition he’s had to live with, and overcome, since 2007, at the end of his junior year at North Dakota State University.
“began experiencing stomach pain and diarrhea, sometimes accompanied by blood in my stool, and getting through each day was challenging,” he recalls. “had little control over my bowels, and I'd worry about having an accident. It was like being a toddler again.”
gamut of tests, including colonoscopy, x-rays, and blood tests, led to his entirely unexpected diagnosis.
Despite complications and hospitalizations over the next year, Dennis earned his bachelor’s degree in journalism on time. However, with no other viable long-term solution in sight for his pain, he agreed to have his colon removed in a series of three surgeries, which meant living with an ostomy, a surgically-created opening in the body for the discharge of body wastes, for more than six months.
While recovering, Dennis tapped into social media. He posted videos about his experience and chatted online with others dealing with similar conditions. At the encouragement of a former professor, he pursued his master’s degree in health communication. He enjoyed this so much, he then earned his doctorate in the same field to get more involved in teaching and research.
His long recovery also gave him time to revisit his latent talent for painting, a creative passion that started in high school.
“got out my old acrylic paints and brushes, and started putting colors on the canvas,” Dennis says. “The ideas just unfolded. After those surgeries were behind me, had more time and energy because my health was so much better, and started painting more and posting my work online. Painting helped me counter the very personal and physical destruction was living with every day.”
Dennis is still partial to the quick-drying acrylic paints. “can put things down, wait a little bit, and then add some more,” he says. “go back and forth and finish a painting quickly. It’s liberating to have that total control.”
And, since he doesn’t have a dedicated studio space, Dennis also likes that he can finish a painting in just a couple of weeks. This way, his materials aren’t taking up too much space in his apartment.
As inflammatory bowel disease attacked his body and his life,
Dennis found meaning and inspiration in his art.
Rediscovering this passion helped Dennis see past his daily struggles to find what’s important in life.
“Before my illness, would fill the canvas with a vibrant background of sky, leaving a foreground of black silhouettes,” Dennis says. “But now, the earthy stuff is getting more variation. That's where see my painting and myself evolving — with hope and optimism.”
Dennis also enjoys origami, the Japanese art of folding paper into decorative shapes and figures.
“started origami in high school, around the same time started painting,” Dennis says. “enjoyed how a square sheet of paper, which looks like nothing, after a couple of folds already starts to take on three dimensions.”
Today, he still embraces this challenging art.
“It’s much more limited than painting, and have a much harder time deviating from instructions or coming up with something on my own,” Dennis says. “But, as learn what the paper can and can't do, and how the folds divide mathematically into smaller folds and so forth, start to see the logic of how origami is put together.”
In the same way, Dennis now understands how his health issues have shaped him as a person. While a painful part of his college years, his illness enabled him to meet (and help) many people with the same condition and even taught him he can persevere.
“As I'm farther removed from that critical time, start to see the value in my illness,” Dennis says. “I've seen setbacks, and realized … got through them. still finished school and pursued my career goals. My Christian faith was rejuvenated, and this faith inspires me. Maybe it didn't happen exactly how wanted, but life went on, and there were always people to help me out.”
It also opened the door to having his art showcased by Janssen.
“The folks at found my site and asked me to be one of their featured artists,” he recalled. “They explained how they would use my art and that gave me confidence that they were doing it for the right reasons. They help me to spread my message further.”
Working with has been part of a journey that further refined the way Dennis viewed his own artwork. “For Janssen, updated a painting had done already, but the new version is more optimistic. The tree that had been completely dead now has ribbons. Partnering with and seeing its appreciation for art has been a great process for me.”
Below, learn more about Dennis and how his creative activities have helped him conquer his and make a difference in the lives of others.
