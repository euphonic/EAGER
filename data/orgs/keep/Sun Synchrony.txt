develops innovative concentrating photovoltaic solar panels to provide clean, safe, and reliable energy using a fraction of the space of conventional silicon products, while lowering materials and energy inputs to manufacturing.
Our products combine  the exceptional efficiency of state-of-the-art broad-spectrum multi-junction photovoltaic cells with the compact profile and ease of installation of fixed panels using our unique SunSynchronoussun-tracking  and focusing technology. By eliminating bulky and expensive external trackers, our ArcSolPanel will bring high-efficiency concentrated solar power to space-constrained markets that have been poorly served by conventional panels.
Â© 2014Synchrony, a California corporation, is developing very high-efficiency concentrating photovoltaic ( ) systems resembling flat-plate panels in form-factor and application scope.
Armed with an intellectual property portfolio covering its key innovations in optics and tracking, is creating a family of products that span utility-scale to rooftop generation applications.
