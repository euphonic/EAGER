  Our tests leverage innovations in genomic technology and machine learning to enable a significantly more confident diagnosis than currently possible in challenging diseases such as thyroid cancer, lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. We are creating new standards of care in the diagnosis of these diseases by enabling more patients to avoid unnecessary invasive procedures, speeding time to diagnosis and removing costs from the healthcare system.
To improve the lives of patients by resolving diagnostic uncertainty and reducing 
 risky, costly and often unnecessary surgeries.
To lead a transformation of diagnostics with a new genomic standard of truth.
At we are transforming disease diagnosis as we know it. Our tests are improving the lives of patients, providing them with – and a clear path forward when current diagnostic approaches are limited. We are doing something REAL.

Evidence is the basis for what drives good science. It's the foundation of the future of healthcare and the way in which we treat or don’t treat each and every patient. It's the difference between a guess and an answer, a diagnostic odyssey and clarity on what to do next.
Today, we sit at the nexus of big data, analytics, technology and science fueling a relentless curiosity to know more. In the midst of the biggest transition in the history of healthcare we are fundamentally changing diagnostics and patient care. Resolving ambiguity with evidence that is trustworthy, actionable and has a proven, positive impact on patient care.
This is the Age of Evidence.
Where a new definition of diagnostic truth is changing patient care as we know it. Where physicians and patients can now benefit from the evolution of healthcare and know, by design, the answers they seek.
In reviewing the evidence, the committee  concluded that  most people will experience at least one diagnostic error in their lifetime, sometimes with devastating consequences.
Improving Diagnostics in Healthcare
