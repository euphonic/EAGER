vigorously supports the concept of "Hospital Ownership of Organ Donation" when this 
ownership is a part of a collaborative effort to enhance donation awareness and support among hospital staff. To this end, the healthcare professionals of provide the hospital the resources it needs to ensure all staff members are educated in the need for, value of, and current practice of donation and transplantation.
In the spirit of collaboration, works closely with your hospital to help you provide quality care and personal attention to families facing the death of a loved one. The following information will help orient you to the nature and extent of our collaborative relationship.
	Not-for-profit Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs), like Health, are federally designated by The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to serve specific regions of the country and were established to:
Educate the public about benefits of organ donation and transplantation
Recover, preserve and distribute donated organs
Increase the availability of organs for transplantation
Support, promote and assist tissue donation
	The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has included in its Conditions of
	Participation a requirement that all hospitals refer all deaths and imminent deaths to the local in a timely manner.
Hospitals are reviewed for compliance by Joint Commission and Medicare. To help ensure the hospital
	performs well in this review, Helath staff prepares a review of the hospital's donation process by reviewing the hospital's medical records. then shares with you any opportunities for
	improvement, both to avoid any future survey challenges with and Joint Commission and to help you help your families in crisis.
Hospital /Collaboration
Educate hospital staff on the donation process
Ensure potential donors receive appropriate and aggressive treatment to allow the opportunity for organ and tissue donation
Present families of deceased patients with organ and tissue donation options
Manage the potential donor while testing and placement are performed
Review death records
Why is Collaboration So Important?
	Working together is the only way we can prevent the harmful and untimely request for consent, help the family have the opportunity for organ and tissue donation, and maintain the viability of organs upon the death of the donor.
	is certified by to facilitate the donation and transplantation process within the state of Virginia as well as parts of West Virginia. collaborates with approximately 72 area hospitals and the Office of the Chief Medical Examiners to provide donation-related services, including:
Supporting potential donor families in their time of loss
Coordinating the recovery of all medically suitable organs and tissues for transplant
Ensure organs are effectively placed with 5 regional and many national transplant centers
Additionally, provides after care support to donor families and educates the diverse
