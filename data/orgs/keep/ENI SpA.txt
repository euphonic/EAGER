International scope, discoveries and fresh opportunities
We were born in Italy, but right from the start we’ve looked beyond our national
                  boundaries. We work worldwide, combining our operations with plans for the development
                  of local communities. We believe in dialogue, integration, transparency and the sharing
                  of skills. We want to grow in tandem with the people who work with us.

By investing in new solutions we can increase the efficiency and sustainability of
                  our operations, reducing both costs and environmental impact. This is a real commitment
                  that we express in every area of our business: from the exploration of new deposits
                  to the subsequent stages of production, transport and refining, with a particular

Developing green businesses
We are investing in research into forms of energy that reduce emissions of gases
               that are harmful to the planet, focusing on sustainable mobility and obtaining chemicals
               from renewable sources. We are developing renewable energy projects involving concentrated

and education
Ettore Scola: “Man’s best friend on four wheels”.
The six-legged dog, which was designed by Luigi Broggini and re-designed twice, in
                  1972 and 1998, by Bob Noorda, tells the story of our company through graphics and
                  literature. In over sixty years it has changed its shape but not its skin and with
                  its paws in Italy and its head in the world it has always managed to look ahead.

Enrico Mattei: “Genius lies in seeing opportunity where others don’t”
In 1953, he founded a company on values of innovation and internationalisation, immediately
                  foreseeing that natural gas, up until then unknown in Europe, would enable the Italian
                  industry to kick-start the economic boom. Today, the legacy is plain for all to see.

and energy transition
In 2017, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) recognised us as one of the leading oil and gas companies on the Climate List. We are heading increasingly towards the decarbonization of the energy system. Natural gas represents an opportunity for us to strategically reposition ourselves, given its lower carbon intensity and the possibility of integrating it with renewable sources in the production of electricity. We want to invest in the methane supply chain in order to continue to reduce CO

Awareness at all levels
has developed and adopted a model for Integrated Risk Management (IRM) that aims
                  to ensure the company takes risk-informed decisions. In addition, the model seeks
                  to increase awareness at all levels of the organisation that appropriate risk assessment
                  and management can affect the company's value and ability to deliver on targets.
Integrated Risk Management Model
Risk Governance and guidelines for Risk management
Risk Governance attributes a central role to the Board of Directors (BoD) which defines
               the nature and level of risk in line with strategic targets, including in the evaluation
               process all those risks that could be consistent for the sustainability of the business
               in the medium-long term.
The BoD, with the support of the Control and Risk Committee, outlines the guidelines
                        for risk management, so as to ensure that the main corporate risks are properly identified
                        and adequately assessed, managed and monitored.
Eni’s CEO, through the process, presents every three months a review of
                        the Eni’s main risks to the Board of Directors. The analysis is based on the
                        scope of the work and risks specific of each business area and processes aiming at
                        defining an integrated risk management policy.

In accordance with the law, the statutory auditing of Eni’s financial statements is entrusted to an external Audit Firm appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting, on a reasoned proposal of the Board of Statutory Auditors.
Activities and fees
Acting upon the reasoned proposal of the Board of Statutory Auditors, Eni’s Shareholders' Meeting of 29 April 2010 approved the engagement of Sp( formerly Ernst & Young SpA) for the 2010-2018 period to perform the following: 
auditing of the Company’s individual financial statements;
auditing of the consolidated financial statements;
verification, during the course of the financial period, that the Company's accounts are duly maintained and that operations are correctly entered in the accounting records;
a limited audit of the semi-annual financial report;

Activities and fees of Group for the period 2010 – 2018
SpA has also been engaged to provide the same auditing services to the subsidiaries of SpA. 
SpA also provides additional services, in the manner described in International Standard on Auditing no. 600 (600). This involves, for the purposes of preparing an opinion on the consolidated financial statements, the assumption of full liability for auditing activities performed by any other Audit Firms regarding the financial statements of subsidiaries that, taken together, account for an immaterial share of consolidated assets and revenues. By assuming this liability, SpA, in its report on the consolidated financial statements, has the role and responsibility of sole auditor for the Group. 
 Thus, the Audit Firm’s overall proposal for Eni’s Group as formulated in 2010 is structured as follows:
133,379,211
of which, for statutory audit activities
of which, for activities
40,136,103
of which, for additional services
Considering the significant time span covered by the assignment, it was envisaged to recognize Sp, adjustments of the fees in the presence of i) non-recurring and unforeseeable events at the time of the competition occurred during the financial year and ii) recurrent major activities of auditing review.
In carrying out its work, the Audit Firm shall have access to the information, data (both documentation and digital information), archives and property of the Company and its subsidiaries. 
 The "Rules on the auditing of financial statements", approved by the Board of Statutory Auditors and the Board of Directors - following the issuance of a favorable opinion by the Control and Risk Committee - set out the general principles pertaining to: the granting and revocation of the engagement; relations between the primary auditor of the Group and secondary auditors; the independence of the Audit Firm and causes for incompatibility; reporting responsibilities and obligations of the Audit Firm; and the regulation of information flows towards the Company and the SEC. 
This regulatory instrument is under review as a result of the profound revision of sector legislation (1).
In the new regulatory framework of the statutory auditing, the Board of Statutory Auditors has been entrusted with the responsibility for the approval of additional assignments and extra work, subject to the opportunity for adequate disclosure to the Board of Directors.
The Board of Statutory Auditors of SpA:
approves the assignment of additional recurring assignments closely related to statutory auditing activity (e.g. costs certification under petroleum contracts) while conferring the Group's total assignment;
previously approved the additional assignments provided by civil law or other regulations concerning subsidiaries (e.g. services requested to the auditor responsible for auditing the financial statements by the Authorities and / Control Entities);
approves the proposals for additional assignments, non-forbidden and unforeseen in the contest of the definition of the assignment, which are submitted by the subsidiary to the Board of Statutory Auditors (e.g. agreed procedures on areas related to the internal control system);
approves the audit firm requests on fees variations in case of non-preventable extra efforts when preparing the original offer.
(1) Formed by: i) European Regulation no. 537/2014, ii) European Directive no. 56/2014 and iii) Legislative Decree No.135 / 2016 which transposed the Directive, thus updating the provisions of the Legislative Decree no. 39/2010 currently in force.

Finance in the transition toward a sustainable economy
We often talk about it, also because of Eni's huge commitment. But what exactly do we mean by the term "green finance"? 
Sustainable development and finance flows consistency
International attention to environmental protection issues has grown in recent years and interest in transitioning toward a “green” economy has increased as a result. In particular, the adoption of the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals in September 2015 and the COP21 Paris Agreement three months later represented important steps toward an economic development model based on decarbonization. In this context, “green finance” plays an increasingly active role in the mobilisation of capital for environmentally friendly projects.
Green finance and green financiers
Generally the term “
the set of financial investments (either public or private) directed at 
sustainable development
 projects and initiatives, including policies that encourage the process of transition toward a low-carbon economy
, such as the realisation of a wind farm or feed-in tariffs for the development of renewable sources. 
Green finance fully includes initiatives to 
mitigate and adapt to climate change
, in particular projects to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, and initiatives connected with water management, the protection of biodiversity, energy efficiency, sustainable transport, and the development of clean energy sources.
? Projects with a green vocation are prevalently funded by governments, public bodies and financial institutions (such as the World Bank and the European Investment Bank) on account of the high initial risks that these types of investments, for the most part with high technological and innovative content, involve. However, 
the support of the private sector is steadily increasing
 in the form of public-private partnerships and through the participation of institutional investors like pension funds and insurance companies whose long-term vision is well suited to the time frames of investments in the environmental area. 
in the energy sector, in particular, has taken on a prominent role in the mobilisation of increased public and private investment at world level, as shown by the recent development of sizeable green funds
 that privilege environmental criteria in investment selection. This is the case, for example, of the 
Breakthrough Energy Coalition
, a private capital network that, in collaboration with governments and research institutions, aims to accelerate change in the energy field by investing in 
innovative low-carbon solutions
and the role of green financiers
In recent years we have seen growing attention to environmental issues also by 
large energy companies
more and more often link their industrial strategies to environmental sustainability and climate friendliness
. Amongst the most important O&companies, 
is in the front line
, directly engaging in the principal global climate initiatives through international partnerships.
 One of these is the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI), an organisation that unites the leading energy companies with the goal of identifying and fostering concrete actions to fight the effects of climate change through collaboration and sharing best practices. Officially launched in 2014 on the occasion of the Climate Summit, the is led by the CEOs of the 10 participating companies, which jointly represent over one-fourth of world production. places the O&sector at the forefront as an active player in the fight against climate change, highlighting the common commitment of the companies belonging to the sector to find concrete solutions in their efforts to reduce climate-changing gas emissions
10 years of green bonds: the continuous growth of green bonds
The escalation of investments in projects connected with environmental and climate issues has required the introduction of specific 
 In particular, the last few years have seen the spread of so-called green bonds, i.e., debentures that encourage investments in projects favourable to the environment and climate. The way they work is similar to normal debt securities: the body that issues the bond receives capital, while investors enjoy a fixed return in the form of interest. The difference is that green bonds explicitly foresee using the proceeds for environmental purposes. To ensure transparency and credibility of these mechanisms, a certification method has been set up that ensures their green vocation. It can be based on two different standards:
, developed chiefly by banks and international corporations
, promoted by the Climate Bonds Initiative (CBI). The is the leading non-profit organisation active in the green bond market and each year it monitors their scope.
Starting in 2007, the year in which they began to win acceptance internationally, they have displayed exponential growth
: the market value of the issues of certified green bonds – which the defined “labelled green bonds” – has soared from about $800m at the outset to the record figure of 
. The prospects for 2018 are even more optimistic with forecasts indicating they will exceed $250 - 300bn by the end of the year. And this is just the tip of the iceberg: also considering uncertified bonds – which the terms “climate-aligned bonds” – issued for funding green investments, it is estimated that in 2017 the overall market value reached $895bn.

The price of oil
What is the Brent oil price? Why is it used as a benchmark for oil prices? Will it keep this role in the future?
During the first half of 2017 the Brent oil price has mainly been fluctuating between 50 - 55 dollars a barrel (USD/bbl). Starting at the end of May, however, there has been a sharp drop in the price, falling below the $ 50 / bbl limit for the whole month of June.
Seemingly simple and descriptive information such as this, which can be found in several trade and standard press articles, does in fact take a by no means indifferent wealth of knowledge for granted and may leave a careful reader asking himself a number of questions. What is the Brent oil price? Why is it used as a benchmark for oil prices? Will it keep this role in the future? Without pretending to be exhaustive, we will try to provide some concrete answers to these questions.
Some concrete answers
The Brent oil price over the years becoming both the physical and financial benchmark for two thirds of world oil trading. However, despite its growing popularity, an increasing number of doubts are emerging as to its future benchmarking capacity.
The path of Brent
In 1971, Shell Exploration and Production (Shell ExPro) - a joint venture (50:50) between Shell and Exxon Exploration and Production - discovered an oil and gas field in the North Sea, more precisely off the north-east coast of Scotland, halfway between the Shetland Islands and Norway. This discovery was called Brent, in line with Shell UK's policy of naming all offshore oil fields found in the 1970s after seabirds. In this particular case, the choice fell on the Brent goose, a species of goose of the genus Branta which typically spends the winter months along the coasts of the North Sea and the Irish Sea.
Field production, which can undoubtedly be considered a milestone in the Oil & Gas industry, began in 1976 and since then, the term Brent has also been used to describe the quality of the oil extracted. But the first real "window on the world" opened in 1979 when, through a pipeline system named the Brent Pipeline System, cargoes of Brent began to reach the onshore Sullom Voe terminal in the Shetland Islands: this was the largest and most flexible export structure of its time and was particularly popular with refiners because it provided ample availability in terms of loading dates and could accommodate tankers of any tonnage or size.
But why did Brent become benchmark for crude oil, first for the European and then for the international market? Several elements came into play to favour its being selected as a benchmark:
the excellent characteristics of its mix: it is a light crude (38° API) with a low sulphur content (0.4%) which make it possible to obtain high yields in terms of premium products such as petrol and diesel and low desulphurization costs
close proximity to major European consumer markets: it was the first and largest oil field with access to Europe
political, fiscal and regulatory stability of the producer country: the UK
the flexibility provided by the Sullom Voe export terminal
an adequate production volume, strengthened by the union of its flows with those of another oil quality - Ninian oil - produced in the same section of the North Sea by the BP/Chevron consortium and also handled by the Sullom Voe terminal
growth in physical trading thanks to the launch of the 15 day Brent contract in 1986 by Shell UK: a standard contract for the purchase and sale of Brent cargoes which owes its name to the fact that the seller undertakes to communicate the actual delivery date of the cargo at least 15 days in advance.
This move by Shell, together with the technical and geographical characteristics of Brent oil, has favoured, since the 1980s, the creation of an important physical market, for both spot and forward deals, referring to this type of oil which, amongst other things, was not controlled by Since then, the value of Brent published by specialized media agencies - and above all Platts, the oldest and best known of them all, with headquarters in New York - has become a reference for several other qualities of crude oil traded in the world, with their prices being defined by applying an increase (premium) or reduction (discount) differential, in relation to the price of the crude oil produced in the North Sea. Specifically, the reference value taken into consideration was (and still is) the so-called Brent dated, published every day by Platts and relative to physical North Sea oil cargoes to which specific delivery dates were assigned.
The importance of Brent was increased and its investiture as a benchmark was consolidated substantially by the launch, in 1988, of the first Brent futures contract on the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE), London's International Oil Exchange, incorporated in 2001 by the Intercontinental Commodities Exchange (ICE). Since 2012, Brent Futures contracts trading on the are the most liquid of this type of contract in the world and the relative prices condition and are conditioned, according to complex and not always transparent mechanisms and dynamics, by the underlying physical market.
Shell ExPro publicly announces the discovery of an oil field and baptises it Brent.
The Brent field reaches its production peak at around 430,000 bbl/d.
The Brent field produces its first billionth barrel of oil.
Brent crude is mixed with Ninian (discovered and produced by the BP/Chevron consortium) at the Sullom Voe export terminal.
Platt adds two new North Sea oils to the Brent market: Oseberg (Norway) and Forties (United Kingdom).
Shell announces the start of preparatory work in the decommissioning process for the production platforms and wells linked to the Brent field.
The historical differential between Brent and (West Texas Intermediate) is inverted.
Ice Brent becomes the most commonly traded futures contract in the world.
Platts announces the inclusion of the Norwegian crude oil, Troll, in the Brent basket, starting as 1 January 2018. The new basket will be known as BFOET.
Will it keep this role in the future?
At the time of its discovery, the life expectancy of the Brent field was 25 years; however, continuous investments made in the '90s have extended its exploitation period way beyond initial expectations.  But sooner or later, with the decline in production it becomes necessary to take stock of the situation, especially if we are talking about a crude oil used as an international benchmark.  After the peak in 1984 - when the production of 430,000 bbl/d of Brent met the annual energy requirements of approximately half of all homes - production volumes have been declining. The decrease in available cargoes - in spite of the mix with Ninian since 1990 - reduces the liquidity of the physical market making deals more complex and increasing the vulnerability of the benchmark to possible speculative price distortions.
To remedy these obvious problems, in July 2002 the Brent market was "modified" to also include the Forties and Oseberg flows, two good quality oils, again extracted in the North Sea, in fields operated by Apache and Statoil respectively. It soon became evident, however, that this solution, no matter how effective, was only provisional. In June 2007, the trend of decline also in the newly added productions being confirmed, the basket was enriched with a new oil, the Norwegian Ekofisk, which brought overall production up to 1.4 MMbbl/d. This field is operated by ConocoPhillips. Since then, for the next 10 years, the evaluation of the Brent Dated has been known as the - Brent, Forties, Oseberg, Ekofisk basket - and its daily value has reflected the price of the most competitively priced oil, i.e. the lowest price of the four.
For 10 years, in fact. Already in 2015 the physical cargoes of were lower than 1 MMbbl/d, revealing the chronic nature of the decline in North Sea oil production and the need to further intervene to try and confirm the representativeness of the benchmark. Hence the recent announcement by the frequently appointed Platts, to proceed with a new revision: as of 1 January 2018, Troll will be added, the oil extracted from the field of the same name located off the Norwegian coast and operated by Statoil. In this way, the total cargoes of Brent Dated - now to take into account the latest addition - should be somewhere in the region of 1.2 MMbbl/d.
In addition to allowing greater liquidity of the physical market - with positive effects also on financial trading within the circuit - the addition of Troll brings with it a major change in the Brent basket shareholder structure:  the Norwegian company Statoil in fact becomes the main supplier of oil in the mix overtaking Shell, which up until now had held the dominant role in North Sea trading. With the new subdivision of supplies no company holds more than a quarter of the total production.  But also this time, the addition of Troll won't be enough to solve the liquidity problems of the Brent market: according to the main forecasts on this matter, the decline in productivity in the North Sea fields is unstoppable and the overall volume of the five oils included in the baskets will have dropped to about 500,000 bbl/d by 2025.
In addition, one can not overlook the imminent exhaustion of production in the Brent field, the field which started it all. After 40 years of operation, in 2006 Shell started the preparatory work for the removal, or more technical term decommissioning of the 4 platforms and 154 wells connected to the field, from which only a few hundred barrels of oil are extracted a day.
That being the case, there is no point making any hypothesis on the introduction of new qualities in the Brent basket, even from outside the North Sea extraction area. Among these is Shell's recent proposal to Platts to assess the addition of oil from the Russian Urals which, despite being of medium quality and sulphorous, could be an ideal candidate as it is perfectly suited to the plant design of refineries in North-Western Europe and is consequently in high demand. At the basis of the Shell proposal, there is always the intention to safeguard the representativeness of the Brent benchmark that could soon be affected by another factor, other then just the decline in North Sea productivity: the comeback of the  But let's take a step back and try and understand what the is and why there is talk of a possible comeback.
The duel with the WTI
As we have seen, the importance of Brent as a benchmark for oil prices was already clear in the 1980s, shortly after it came into production. However, despite the fact that it was the crude oil against which most oil traded on a global scale was priced, up until 2011 its role - or rather its reputation - remained secondary to that of West Texas Intermediate (in its abbreviated form): a high quality mix of oils produced in different areas of the United States and stored at the Cushing terminal in Oklahoma. In fact the price - benchmark value for crude consumed in the United States - was often identified collectively as world oil.  The trend was similar to that of Brent, compared to which it had an average premium - between 2000 and 2010 - of nearly 1.5 USD/bbl.  In 2011, however, the differential between the two prices was not only inverted, but progressively and significantly widened: in that year, the average price of North Sea oil was 16 USD/bbl higher than American oil, undermining the beliefs about the representativeness of the as a global benchmark.
What happened?  The had disengaged itself from the international dynamics of the oil market and was responding to purely domestic logic: the increase in production determined by the new unconventional production of shale oil had caused an excess in supply that could not be absorbed through oil exports, prohibited - in the United States - since 1975.  This encouraged a strong growth in stocks held at the Cushing terminal, where other types of oil were also arriving - albeit of lower quality, such as the Canadian oil sands - representing the largest volume of the oil fields.  In summary, while on the international oil market the Arab Spring raged, with internal crises in major Middle East and North African producer countries, crude showed purely local dynamics and did not reflect the tensions of the global market.  It could therefore no longer be considered a good indicator of the world oil price.  
However, in recent years, the price differential between Brent and has been strongly reduced and the two oils have resumed following similar trends, despite the North Sea reference being listed as premium over oil.  Then, in 2016 the ban on exporting oil from the United States was lifted, in response to changes caused by the shale revolution, triggering the hypothesis of a possible return of as a world benchmark.
If, in the medium term, resorting to a valid alternative to the Brent price seems unlikely, over the longer term there are a whole number of hypotheses.  In addition to the renewed interest in oil, several analysts fear completely new solutions, including the identification of an Asian benchmark, given the increasing share of world demand absorbed by this area, or even the complete overhaul of the current price system in response to a market of constant and marked change. In the meantime, for a while, the benchmark will be the Brent basket, even when it is "Brent-less."

This sets out the main values that guide Eni’s actions. Everyone in Eni, along with those who work with us towards the same objectives, is bound to comply with the principles in the Code of Ethics.  
Integrity and transparency are the principles that guide Eni’s action in formulating a management and control structure that is suited to its size, complexity and operating structure, in adopting an effective internal control and risk management system, and in communicating with shareholders and other stakeholders, also by reviewing and updating the information on its website.
Integrity and transparency
was one of the first European companies to create a Business Conduct Code. The first version dates back to 1994.
, approved by the Board of Directors on March 14, 2008, which replaces the previous 1998 Code of Conduct. The Code of Ethics was updated on April 10, 2014  and lastly on November 23, 2017.
Directors, Statutory Auditors,  management and all Eni’s employees, as well as those who operate in Italy or abroad to achieve Eni’s objectives, are required to uphold, in the context of their own functions and duties, the principles set out in the Code of Ethics.
The Code contains concrete rules of behaviour, so that the principles contained therein form a practical guide for corporate operations.
For that purpose, the Code of Ethics has been translated into 
(english, french, german, russian, vietnamese, chinese, dutch, hungarian, turkish, slovenian, spanish, kazakh, greek, portuguese, flemish, slovak, arabic, polish, romanian, indonesian and czech). It has been distributed widely and is explained through a range of initiatives, including special training courses. The Code represents an essential general principle of Model 231 of which it is an integral part, as well as a key element of the anti-corruption framework: the synergies between the Code of Ethics and the Model 231 are underlined by the assignment to the Watch Structure – established by Model 231 – of the function of 
Guarantor of the Code of Ethics
, with the duty of promoting and verifying its implementation.
The Guarantor of the Code of Ethics presents a 
report every six months
 on the implementation of the Code and any updating need to the Control and Risk Committee, to the Board of Statutory Auditors and to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of Eni, who in turn report to the Board.
The Code of Ethics applies to all direct or indirect subsidiaries and to suppliers
, both in Italy and abroad.

Internationalism, dialogue, an integrated approach. These elements underpin how the men and women of approach their roles every day.
Creating sustainable value
Our corporate aim is to create long-term, sustainable value. While promoting growth, efficiency and the prevention and management of business risks, we give the highest consideration to the interests of all those who work with us and for us. Our activities are based on a business model that has provided us with an excellent strategic position and marked competitive advantages. Our system of corporate governance is a cornerstone of our activity and aims to support the relationship of trust we have with those who work with us and to contribute to the achievement of business success.
We are the “energy solution” for the countries where we operate
wants to improve access to energy in the countries in which it operates. Our inspiration comes from the Mattei formula (the basis for planning relationships with foreign governments devised by company founder Enrico Mattei), which since the 1960s has aimed to establish an equal relationship with oil-producing countries, creating the basis for a model of responsible economic development. 
The founder’s conviction is still valid today and aims to help producing countries become independent in energy supply through dialogue and respect for cultures.
Our head in the world
Internationalism, dialogue, an integrated approach: while we are firmly rooted, we work all over the world.
Forging an integrated approach
We work in an increasingly global scenario, where contact with different worlds and cultures has become part of our everyday life. Our goal is to create a system with local people in order to contribute to the development of the territories in which we operate. Our commitment is realised through long-term agreements with the governments of the countries concerned and local people, implementing projects that benefit local communities and promote dialogue.
For us, environmental protection is fundamental for sustainable development in the implementation of industrial projects. 
Throughout the life cycle of our plants, we assess the environmental, social, economic and cultural impact of our activities
, including on indigenous peoples, guaranteeing mitigation and constantly putting improvement processes in place. For us, being sustainable means managing the risks and mitigating the impact of operating activities. 
It is in this way that we can help create added value for all.

In collaboration with (Fondazione Enrico Mattei), is engaged in a range of student initiatives aimed at a closer examination of the subject of energy.
Encouraging kids to find out more about technology through content that exploits the possibilities of multimedia.
The future of energy goes to school 
 is an initiative created to bring unconventional teaching to the classroom on science subjects with a focus on energy. It allows children to learn new content through the development of three themes: 
Energy and the Environment, In the Classroom and Projects for the Territory.
Energy resources and environmental sustainability 
‘Energy and the Environment’ – created in collaboration with Fondazione Enrico Mattei (FEEM), research centres and leading authors such as Folco Quilici – teaches students about energy and respect for the planet. The portal, aimed at kids in primary and secondary schools, is full of news, analysis and games.
English and multimedia science lessons
The ‘In the Classroom’ project, created by and the Ministry of Education in 2010, supports schools in the process of innovation begun with the introduction of new technologies. 
 is an online course for building English language skills, 
Clilinaction
 includes lessons in English, mathematics, physics, life sciences and chemistry using the (Content Language Integrated Learning) method, while Science in the Classroom offers lessons in physics, biology, geology and chemistry, created in partnership with Italian schools.
With the ‘Projects for the Territory’ initiative, involves Italian and foreign schools in the promotion of energy and environmental culture through innovative learning methods that concentrate on a specific territory. Erasmus+Necst offers educational opportunities in line with programmes promoted by the European Union and involves students from Italy, Norway, Croatia and the Netherlands via the cross-media platform

Mediterranean Energy Perspectives 2018
The centrality of natural gas in a scenario of change
and education
In 2017 delivered outstanding results proving the effectiveness of our deep transformation process started in 2014. As a result of this, the Company is now on a strong footing and is able to create value even in the most difficult market conditions, such as the last price downturn that was among the most severe ever affecting the oil&gas industry.

From exploration successes to new deposits
In brief, the company’s achievements during the year.
Economic and financial results
Adjusted operating profit more than doubled to €5.80 billion (up by €3.49 billion vs. 2016), adjusted net profit of €2.38 billion compared to the loss reported 2016. This recovery in profitability was underpinned by the implementation of strategic drivers focused on upstream profitable growth, the turnaround and cost efficency initiatives in the mid-downstream business, leveraging on the scenario recovery.
Adjusted operating profit doubled vs. 2016 to €5.2 billion.
Turnaround in the mid-downstream
Adjusted operating profit increasing by €1 billion in 2017: - G&P: operating profit structurally positive a year ahead of plans; - R&M: break-even refining margin below of 4 $/bbl and operating profit at record level from last eight years; - Versalis: all-time best operating performance
€7.6 billion, reducing by 18% vs. 2016. Self-financing ratio of net capex at approximately 130%.
Organic cash neutrality covering capex and dividend at a Brent price of 57$/bbl; 39$/bbl, factoring in proceeds from disposals.
Gearing and Leverage
confirms a solid financial structure with a gearing of 18%, the lower end of the European peer group and a leverage of 23%, leveraging on the excellence in operating cash flow generation, capex optimization and gains from disposals
The Company’s robust results and strong fundamentals underpin a dividend distribution of €0.80 per share of which €0.40 per share paid as interim dividend in September 2017.
Dual Exploration Model
Closed the 40% disposal of the super-giant Zohr gas field in Egypt offshore – through two different transactions with (10%) and Rosneft (30%) – and the 25% disposal of Area 4 in Mozambique to ExxonMobil. In March 2018, signed an agreement with Mubadala Petroleum for the divestment of a further 10% interest in Zohr.
Hydrocarbon production at record level
1.82 million boe/d, the highest ever level, with a 5.3% growth vs. 2016. Start-ups and rampups additions of 243 kboe/d leveraged on Eni’s exploration and development integrated model, designed to optimize new projects’ time-to-market (Zohr in Egypt, East-Hub in Angola, in Ghana, Jangkrik in Indonesia, all in 2017) and on accelerate fields ramp-ups (Noroos).
In 2017 added 1 bln boe of new resources, of which 0.8 bln boe from in house exploration with a discovery cost of approximately 1 $/bbl.
Reloading of approximately 97,000 square kilometers of new acreage: - awarded 50% of the mineral rights of the Isatay Block in the Kazakh Caspian Sea; - signed an Exploration and Production Sharing Agreement (EPSA) of Block 52, offshore Oman; - acquired new exploration licenses in Morocco, Mexico, Cyprus and Ivory Coast.
Mid Downstream 
Proved hydrocarbon reserves
7 billion boe with an organic replacement ratio of 103%. The ratio increases to 151% when excluding the reclassification of reserves to the unproved category in Venezuela in accordance with the applicable regulation
International development in the Chemical business
Completed, in South Korea, the construction of the industrial complex for production of premium elastomers, leveraging on Versalis technology and through the 50:50 joint venture Versalis – Lotte Chemical, local operator.
Enhanced the refining know-how through two licensing agreements with the Chinese companies Sinopec and Zhejiang Petrochemicals for the use of the Slurry Technology (EST) conversion proprietary technology.
Achieved production start-up at the supergiant Zohr gas field in record time-to-market: in less than two years from the and two and a half years from discovery.
Successfully completed the exploration campaign offshore Area 1, thanks to the appraisal of Tecoalli discovery which followed that of Amoca and Miztòn, resulting in a rise in estimated hydrocarbons in place of the Area to 2 bln boe, of which approximately 90% oil. Scheduled a fast-track development plan.
Sanctioned by the partners the development project for the exclusive reserves in Area 4 in Mozambique amounting to 16 in place. The Floating facilities construction will be realized through a multi-source project financing of $4.7 billion.
Total recordable injury rate (TRIR) reported a decrease of 6.8% vs. 2016. The reduction for the employees (down by 17.2%) and the contractors (down by 2%) was driven by specific program of education and awareness addressed to Eni’s people. In 2017, was launched the new Safety Training Center in Gela for training in health, safety and environmental issues.
intends to play a leading role in the energy transition process, supporting the objectives of the Paris Agreement. has been committed for a long time to promoting full and effective disclosure on climate change and is the only company in the oil&gas industry to take part in the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) of the Financial Stability Board. In June 2017, the latter published its voluntary recommendations to encourage effective disclosure of the financial implications of climate change; is committed to a gradual implementation of these recommendations.
Eni’s committment for renewable energies was implemented by the start-up of operations for the set-up of plants in Italy and Algeria and the development of other initiatives in Italy and abroad. Signed the collaboration agreement with General Electric and with the Kazakh Ministry of Energy; finalized a Memorandum of Understanding with the Egyptian Ministry of Electricity to jointly realize new renewable plants.
emissions increased by 2.5% vs. 2016 due to the production growth. emission index per barrel produced was down by approximately 3% vs. 2016 and by 19% vs. 2014 in accordance with the long-term target of a 43% reduction by 2025.
Oil spills due to operations
Oil spills due to operations (higher than one barrel), 94% of which relating to the E&segment, more than doubled from 2016. This was mainly due to the spill from a tank located in in Val d’Agri where the Company implemented all the remediation actions to reduce the environmental damage and to prevent any future accident through infrastructure upgrading.
Accordingly to Eni’s carbon footprint reduction strategy, the development program on renewables was implemented by 20 projects on an executive phase or near to FID, which will contribute to increase Eni's generation capacity by around 250 Furthermore, is part of the (Task Force on Climaterelated Financial Disclosures) of the Financial Stability Board, targeted to a more trasparent disclosure about risks and opportunities relating to the climate change.
Commitment to flaring reduction
joins the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR), sponsored by the World Bank, a public-private initiative involving international oil companies, governments and international institutions. reduced gas flaring of approximately 68% in the last ten years and promoted access to energy for over 18 million people in the Sub-Saharan Africa.
Started in 2017 the working group on Human Rights in the business supported by the Danish Institute for Human Rights. The comparison between Company’s processes and the International Standards (Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights) allowed the definition of a roadmap aimed at further improvement

Mediterranean Energy Perspectives 2018
The centrality of natural gas in a scenario of change
and education
The six-legged dog has established the values that underpin corporate communication. Today this is also expressed through the campaign with Italy.
The brand today: combining past and future
Eni’s story continues to be written every day by thousands of men and women around the world. Their experience and the specifics of their work provide the inspiration for the firm’s latest advertising campaign. 
Although it is an innovative company, always looking to the future, nevertheless holds true to its history and its values
; it has always talked about innovation, dialogue, co-operation and culture. The six-legged dog, which these days is called upon to represent a wider array of meanings than ever, shows that we are able to maintain our link with a history that goes back over 60 years while facing a new set of challenges.
with Italy: the institutional campaign
The new campaign highlights Eni’s initiatives and commitments in Italy and features a number of people who talk about how Eni’s ideas have taken root and will continue to come to life in Italy thanks to the work and commitment of its people who, give shape to the company’s projects, transforming them into reality and icons of the issue involved: the sun for 
, a car for 
, a virtual reality mask for training or a backpack for 
alternating school-work initiatives
. But also tank for the transport of 
 from the transformation of organic waste (at the heart of the Waste-to-Fuel spot) and a insulated house using an innovative and ultra-light thermal material 
Since its foundation, 
has put people and substance at the heart of its work
. Key traits for the company are courage, trust in the future and in new ideas. So too are flexibility and the ability to anticipate and follow through change – essential if we are to be able to adapt to all possible scenarios, both national and international, so new value can continue to be created. Today, despite facing many challenges, 
is evolving still, constantly aiming to improve both its work and itself as an organisation
. The new commercial campaign tells the story of a company built by people who produce energy using their own energy; the narrative focuses on their work and highlights the technological and human skills involved. The hands filmed at work in different contexts make clear reference to the ideas of substance, experience and pragmatism that inspire us. There is a story, technology and skills behind every action; this campaign allows the company to reach into people’s homes and talk about itself, putting across the message that actions speak louder than words. The campaign’s tagline is an evocative and direct summary of this new spirit:
We have the energy to see it. We have the energy to do it.
The tagline of the campaign of 2015
Loyalty to the past, faith in the future
The six-legged dog: a symbol that every day tells stories of courage, passion and innovation.
The six-legged dog embodies our values, while our actions move with the times
Certain symbols are fixed in the public imagination – instantly recognisable and inextricably linked with a particular brand or product. 
Eni’s six-legged dog is a fine example – a logo that immediately relates to the company and its values
, telling a story of courage, innovation and substance that combines loyalty to the past with trust in the future. The way in which the brand identity was defined and evolved combines Italian expertise and design with an openness to looking further afield. It describes every aspect of the company’s philosophy, centred on passion for technological innovation and progress, alongside essential values such as integrity, respect for people and environmental protection. Today the company is a dynamic organisation, capable of interacting with an increasingly-competitive market without turning its back on protecting the individual and the landscape. 
In its advertising campaigns remains true to the values of the past, while adapting them to the times and the actions of the present

sells gas, electricity, and oil products in the European and extra-European markets, also leveraging on trading activities. Products availability is ensured by oil and gas production in the upstream business, long-term gas supply contracts, power plants, Eni’s refinery system as well by Versalis’ chemical plants. The supply of commodities is optimized through trading activity. Integrated business units enable the company to capture synergies in operations and reach cost efficiencies.
Since 2015, the New Energy Solutions Department has been created for the development of renewable energy. Thanks to a distinctive business model, which allows to replace natural gas consumption of the assets with solar or wind energy, is able to exploit industrial, logistical, contractual and commercial synergies to create people.
This business aspect creates value for stakeholders, the company and society as a whole over time. additional value in the projects. This approach allows to reduce the plants’ energy costs and to make available a greater quantity of gas for local consumption or export.
In addition, is developing various projects, not related to its assets, which will allow the distribution of green energy to national networks, and in Countries of operations. 
 Also in the Downstream sector, has developed, in addition to the traditional business, the green production of biofuels, through the conversion of the traditional refineries of Porto Marghera and Gela into biorefineries, and has integrated traditional chemistry with a range of products from renewable sources.

Our model for sustainable development.
Our model for sustainable development.
"We are an energy company. We are working to build a future where everyone can access energy resources efficiently and sustainably. Our work is based on passion and innovation, on our unique strengths and skills, on the quality of our people and in recognising that diversity across all aspects of our operations and organisation is something to be cherished. We believe in the value of long term partnerships with the countries and communities where we operate."
On Friday 30 September, in Paris, chief executive Claudio Descalzi made a presentation to the financial community entitled Environmental Social and Corporate Governance. It was an opportunity to present the company’s new mission, which represents the cardinal principles of the model. 
Herein brief, are the main elements
.strategy that focuses strongly on growth in our core business but also has ambitious objectives, in relation to reducing emissions, maximising the use of gas, especially in view of generating electricity to facilitate access to energy, and developing renewable sources.
We are an energy company
Energy company is also a wide-ranging definition when it comes to time, capable of
            describing Eni's vocation beyond the transformation of its activities and the changeability
            of the scenarios in which it operates.
We are working to build a future where everyone can access energy resources efficiently and sustainably.
Access to energy
The reference to the future and to access to energy are representative of a substantial
            new concept that is central to Eni's new mission. type of access that is efficient
            and sustainable for everyone, not just for the countries that harbour a true difficulty
Our work is based on passion and innovation, on our unique strengths and skills, on the quality of our people and in recognising that diversity across all aspects of our operations and organisation is something to be cherished.
The value of diversity
Passion, innovation, skills and the acknowledgement of all diversities are values that truly exist throughout Eni, and distinguish those who work here. 
The human element acquires a crucial role in the new mission
. People, as in employees, contractors and anyone who works in the company and for the company, both as humanity in the broadest sense, and as a point of departure and ultimate objective of every action performed by Eni.
The introduction of the word diversity, with all its potential meanings, effectively
            expresses Eni’s commitment, also in activities not linked to the core business,
            but performed for the benefit of the communities in the countries in which it operates
            and of the people who are part of its structure. Indeed, diversity is anything but
            a limit. Instead, it is considered a resource, an additional field in which can
We believe in the value of long term partnerships with the countries and communities where we operate.
The importance of the community
The reference to the communities is clear in this phrase, which expresses what has always been one of our company’s strengths since the beginning: its solid, long-lasting relationships with the countries. Partnerships, in the historical sense of the word according to Eni, focuses not only on promoting the resources of the producer countries in economic terms, but also on 
providing practical support for sustainable development
, in particular when it comes to energy. 
This is what we call our dual flag model
We grow when the countries that host us also grow
We believe that enhancing and monitoring local content is a useful tool, internally,
            to improve our planning activities, and, externally, to support the countries in focusing
            their economic development investments.
Our sustainability strategy
We are an energy company.

Our work is based on passion and innovation, on our unique strengths and skills, on the quality of our people and in recognising that diversity across all aspects of our operations and organisation is something to be cherished.

Eni’s Historical Archive represents the living memory of the company.   It contains photographs, minutes of meetings, audio-visual content and previously unseen and unpublished material belonging to Enrico Mattei.
The Archive is headquartered in Pomezia: 
all the historical documents and papers belonging to Enrico Mattei and documentation relating to as a company specializing in the research, production and marketing of petroleum products are stored here
. It includes designs that illustrate the evolution of the logo as well as minutes, press releases and speeches by Enrico Mattei both on paper and video. To understand the emergence of the oil industry in Italy and study the development of our business, we established an archive that encompasses 
our historical heritage as shown by documents, periodicals, photographs, audio-visual and even unpublished material from the private collection of Enrico Mattei
. The archive is the culmination of a long process of research and selection of materials begun in 1993 when the Archival Superintendency of Lazio declared the establishment of an archive to be of considerable historical interest.
The archive is the company’s historical memory
More than sixty years of history: vintage photographs, minutes of meetings, audiovisual and unreleased material that belonged to Enrico Mattei.
Bernardo Bertolucci, Gillo Pontecorvo and Folco Quilici are just some of the great directors who have told the story of and the energy industry in original ways. 
In addition to the film material, the company’s Historical Archive also preserves a significant volume of audio-visual material
. This ranges from commercials by Ettore Scola for the launch of Supercortemaggiore petrol – famous for the slogan “The six-legged dog, man’s best friend on four wheels” – to sound recordings of the speeches of Enrico Mattei, newsreels from the 1950s and recordings of the most recent shareholders’ meetings. Also included are feature-length films such as The Oil Men, which won the prize for best documentary at the National Exhibition of Industrial Film in Genoa (1965); Trasmed: un Gasdotto in Mare Profondo, which won the silver medal at the Mercurio Sansovino International Film Festival in Venice (1983); and Agip Dimensione Mare, which won first prize at the 25th International Festival of Documentary Film and Television in Milan (1985).
It was Enrico Mattei who, in the mid-1950s, decided that cinema was the ideal medium through which to tell the story of Eni’s activities
 – and set up an in-house film department. Its output has included: Italy is Not a Poor Country, by Dutchman Joris Yvens, with a commentary by writer Alberto Moravia; Portrait of a Big Company, by Giacomo Vaccari, with a script by Gian Gaspare Napoletano; and Gela Ancient and Modern, which featured Leonardo Sciascia among its authors. Nor did the close link with Italy’s culture industry stop with the end of Mattei’s chairmanship. The archive preserves on film records made by Agip technicians in the late 1950s in various regions of Africa and the Middle East. These document the lifestyles of local people, their habits and the characteristics of the territory. 
collection of newsreels provides records of plant inaugurations, visits by Italian and foreign dignitaries, conferences and trade fairs
. Everything is there, including television commercials starring well-known actors from film, theatre and TV, including Dario Fo and Franca Rame, Vittorio Gassman, Franca Valeri, Gabriele Ferzetti, Alberto Bonucci and Raffaella Carrà.
photographic record of a company and a country
The photographic archive was established in February 2005
, after having researched and implemented optimal conditions for the specific conservation of all types of material deposited at the Pomezia site. To date, it includes approximately 10,000 images, mainly related to Enrico Mattei, industrial infrastructure and service stations. Cataloguing of the material is achieved using the same software used all types of documents held by the Historical Archive and a special photo card, designed to international standards. Such photographic heritage is of considerable historical and artistic value in terms of both content and the professionals involved, among them: 
Federico Patellani, Mimmo Jodice, Aldo Ballo, Bruno Stefani, Marco Anelli, Studio Rotofoto, Studio Giacomelli and Publifoto
500,000 photographic prints in both black and white and colour
The collection covers an enormous range of formats and types and spans the whole of the last century
. The splendid photographs of Egyptian oilfields taken during the second half of the 1950s by Federico Patellani not only illustrate the characteristics of the fields themselves, but provide testimony of the collaboration between technicians and local workers. Similarly, pictures taken of the first Agip motels capture their sober architecture and furnishings – as well as the spirit of efficiency and courtesy, which was a real strength of the recently-created Agip distribution network.
Words and sounds: powerful storytelling
The Archive also includes approximately 100 sound recordings
. You can find the speeches of Enrico Mattei and political figures recorded on the occasion of visits or inaugurations (on 78rpm vinyl); messages from family members of personnel employed abroad (transmitted by radio in the 1950, thanks to an agreement with RAI); interviews with former managers; and finally the most recent recordings of shareholders’ meetings.

The centrality of natural gas in a scenario of change
and education
The centrality of natural gas in a scenario of change
The role of natural gas, the new players and changes to the market. An overview of the energy source that’s the bridge to a renewable future.
Eni’s goals and strategies for exploiting current changes
As a leading international player in the energy sector, actively participates in the realization of low carbon economy objectives through a growing commitment towards renewable energy sources and by maximizing gas usage, mainly for the decarbonization of electricity generation but also of transport.
Still gas in the future
It is an indisputable fact that 
, combined with a growing use of renewable energy, will play a 
key role
 in the path towards building a low emission impact economy model. There are a number of reasons behind this statement:
its quality as a fossil fuel with a lower carbon content
its flexibility of use for electric power generation
vast worldwide reserves; the competitiveness of prices
growing opportunities for its use - even in liquid form - in transport.
centrality of natural gas in the new energy paradigm
 to be constructed is evident even in the forecast scenarios developed by major international organizations operating in the sector. Today, natural gas accounts for approximately 21% of the world’s primary energy consumption and, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency of Paris (IEA), 
by 2040 its quota will increase to 24%, 
with a growth in absolute terms from 3,500 to 5,200 billion cubic metres (bcm). 
It will be the only fossil fuel to grow significantly 
with an annual average increase 
whereas coal is expected to increase by just 0.2% and oil by 0.4%. 
On a geographic level
, growth in natural gas consumption will be 
which will have a significant impact on the growth in demand of 43%: the role of 
will be dominant, with it alone accounting for 24%. The increase in usage in the 
will also be important, accounting for 21% of increased consumption, and in 
which, by doubling its demand, will contribute to growth by 10.5%. On the other hand, consumption in 
On a sector level
, industry and electricity generation will be the drivers of growth: the 
industrial sector
will contribute 40% to additional consumption while 35% will be determined by its 
where gas, alongside the growth in renewables will be competing above all with coal. At a global level, the extent of its use in 
remains uncertain, with a contribution to overall growth presumably amounting to less than 10%.
Wide availability and new producers
Natural gas is considered to be a relatively abundant source of energy: proven reserves and technically recoverable resources suggest that 
long-term global demand will be easily covered by productive availability
. The proven reserves amount to about 220,000 bcm and recoverable resources to 800,000 bcm; the latter would be able to cover a level of consumption equal to current day volumes for over 200 years. With the exception of Europe, all major regional areas are expected to increase their gas production:
The United States and Australia
will contribute to two-thirds of the increase in production from here until 2020, but from then on the increase in supply will be the result of the growth in other countries and a wider number of producers
In the long term, the 
will account for 24% of world production growth and China (13% of growth) will become a central player in the world gas market
But it will be the emergence of new gas producing countries that will contribute to characterising the world market scenario, with East Africa becoming a new and important extraction area.
, in particular, using their offshore resources, will be added to the historic African producers - such as Nigeria, Algeria, Angola and Egypt - with the latter country set to increase production thanks to development of the large Zohr field discovered by Eni. The gas extracted in Africa will be used both to cover growing domestic demand and to be exported, mostly in the form of liquefied natural gas (LNG). This mode of transport will drive the growth of global gas trade over the coming years.
Changes in the markets and the role of LNG
In global terms, the gas traded between the various macro-regions of production and consumption has increased over the last 25 years by 70% and it is expected to grow by another 70% by 2040, accelerating the process of gas market globalization. Most of the growth will be through trading, the share of which in global long-distance gas deals will increase from the current 40% to approximately 53% (source: IEA), with new producers and importers who will grow in importance. 
 will be accompanied by 
important changes, already underway, in trade agreements and pricing
. From a system of trade built on stable, but also contractually "rigid" relationships, between supplier countries and well-defined groups of buyers, we are moving towards a 
market model built on more flexible trade agreements
 - in terms of the destination of gas, delivery volumes, duration - 
and predominantly based on market prices
 (in the past they were almost entirely linked to oil prices) in a context of greater liquidity with an increase in the number of traders and transactions.
, already for a number of years, procurement strategies of the major importers, including Eni, have been focusing on progressively relaxing the take-or-pay obligations - i.e. obligations to purchase a minimum predefined annual volume even if the purchasing party does not take delivery of it all - included in long-term contracts and on increasing the portfolio quota no longer linked to oil prices but to market prices.
The latter are calculated in the physical or virtual gas trading points (called 
) based on the supply and demand ratio. By way of example, today 90% of Eni's purchasing portfolio is based on prices aligned with the market. Also 
on an international level
, over the medium- to long-term, contractual structures are expected to prevail which can guarantee, as in the oil market, increasingly more flexible and "ready" supplies. These changes will be catalysed by the growth in trading, which, by the nature of its supply chain, is particularly adaptable to commercial formulas of this kind. 
will increase its global availability
: increased flows will come from the and new export areas such as East Africa, as well as from historic producers such as Australia and Qatar. In addition, FRSU (Floating Storage Regasification Unit) technology with offshore floating terminals will help unlock new market outlets or increase those which are currently of minor importance. Therefore, the industrial chain will be both the object and driving force of changes. The contractual structures for trade are becoming more flexible. 
Three major trends
volumes traded per single contract are smaller
and this reflects a gradually more open market, with a higher number of buyers and a growing share of small importers in emerging markets
the predominance of contracts with oil-linked prices has declined
the share of contracts with flexible destination has increased
, where the term flexible refers to open volume contracts for multiple destinations and quantities sold depending on the area in which the demand is created, or reloaded in the port of first destination to be sent to another place of use.
In a well-supplied market and with significant amounts tied to long-term contracts due to expire (Japan), the share of flexible and short-term volumes should increase over the coming years. 
And the arrival on the international scenario of new volumes will significantly increase the flexibility of the entire gas market.

The centrality of natural gas in a scenario of change
and education
Gatto Selvatico and Ecos were Eni’s in-house magazines and featured contributions from some of Italy’s leading writers.
Gatto Selvatico: a “useful and enjoyable” magazine
In 1955, Enrico Mattei decided it was time for to have its own magazine and hired Attilio Bertolucci as the editor
. They immediately agreed on the name Gatto Selvatico – suggested by Bertolucci, who explained that in English “wildcat” was the word for the first oil prospectors. Given full editorial freedom, he was able to create a true cultural melting-pot and by-lines appeared for the likes of Natalia Ginzburg, Carlo Emilio Gadda, Giorgio Caproni, Alfonso Gatto, Romano Bilenchi, Carlo Cassola, Enzo Siciliano, Giorgio Bassani and Leonardo Sciascia. typical issue might include refined reflections on art history alongside short stories by the best writers of the time. The idea was to create a product that went beyond a mere account of business success to explore the reality of life outside the company. In other words, 
it was a “useful and enjoyable” magazine, as Bertolucci himself defined it
. It successfully managed to offer culture on the one hand and cover frivolous issues on the other – all thanks to the great skill of its writers.
Ecos, stories from the world
Over 30 years, it published hundreds of reports from five continents, all translated into several languages.
Ecos: reportage from a magazine
Launched in 1972, 
Ecos was the idea of Gianni Rocca – head of the press office during the chairmanship of Raffaele Girotti
. Like Gatto Selvatico before it, Ecos was able to commission some of the great names of Italian literature, including Primo Levi, Alberto Bevilacqua, Giorgio Saviane, Roberto Vacca, as well as outstanding illustrators and photographers such as Carla Accardi, Giovanni Hajnal, Lucio Castagneri, Francesco Manzini, Emilio Tadini and Giovanni Tinelli. The name was chosen because it was short and easy to remember: 
it recalled the “E” of “Eni” and “energy”, but also of “economy” and “ecology”.
Published in Italian and English, with around 100 pages per issue
, Ecos appeared every two months and was distributed free to employees of the Group and leading figures in politics, business, the arts and journalism, both in Italy and abroad. While it was conceived as a tool for internal communication, it also attempted to highlight the group’s activities around the world and to bring together distant countries. 
Ecos was the first corporate magazine in the West to produce and distribute in China, with special issues in Chinese, Kazakh and Cyrillic
. The magazine was closed down in 2002, to be replaced by Eni’s Way magazine.

More than 1.82 million boe/day, up 5.3 per cent on 2016. Record proceeds of €3.8 billion from net divestments. These are just some of the results achieved by in 2017.
Energy, development and sustainability
Our commitment to energy transition and combatting climate change.
Record success
 continued throughout 2017: we discovered new resources amounting to 1.1 billion boe (1.82 million boe/day), the highest level in Eni’s entire history. These results are extremely encouraging, creating further scope for our Dual Exploration strategy; the 
advance monetisation of successes in exploration
 by selling off minority stakes. It was on this basis that we finalised strategic agreements to sell 25 per cent of Area 4 in Mozambique to ExxonMobil and 50 per cent of the assets under development in the Egyptian Zohr offshore field. The latter took place under three separate arrangements: with (10 per cent), Russian company Rosneft (30 per cent) and, more recently, with Mubadala Petroleum (10 per cent). Since 2013, our Dual Exploration Model has enabled us to monetise reserves worth $10.3 billion.
These outstanding results are the fruit of our integrated exploration and development model, perfected over the last few years, that has enabled us to reduce the time-to-market of our projects while fulfilling our initial investment estimates.
Letter to shareholders
Energy transition 
Faced with a complex international energy scenario, we have made a gradual transition to an energy mix that offers a lower environmental impact. This was in response to the challenges set by the Paris Agreement on Climate Change (COP21) and the need to decarbonise the energy system. In these circumstances, 
natural gas offers oil companies the opportunity to reposition themselves strategically
, given the smaller carbon footprint of natural gas and the possibility of integrating it with renewable sources in the generation of electricity. Eni’s carbon footprint reduction strategy has been boosted by our 
renewable energy development programme
, with around 20 projects currently underway or near to a final investment decision (FID). Together, these will increase Eni’s power-generating capacity by roughly 250In addition, we are involved in the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), the aim of which is to provide market operators with increasingly transparent information on the risks and opportunities associated with climate change. Our commitment to the fight against climate change has been recognised by the (Carbon Disclosure Project), which has listed us as one of the major Oil & Gas companies in the Climate List in 2016.
The value of research
Combating climate change by scientific means is a priority for Eni. We are working to 
ramp up research and technological innovation in the energy sector
, continuing our partnership with and taking part in projects with the Low-Carbon Energy Center promoted by the Energy Initiative. We have renewed our agreement with the Polytechnic University of Turin and have signed another with the Consorzio Interuniversitario Nazionale per la Scienza e Tecnologia dei Materiali (National Intervarsity Consortium for Materials Science and Technology/INSTM). In 2017, Eni’s financial commitment to scientific research and technological development amounted to €185 million, €72 million of which was invested in our decarbonization programme in areas such as energy transition, bio-refining, green chemicals, renewable sources of energy, emissions reduction and energy efficiency. Our production of biofuels topped 206,000 tonnes, 14 per cent up on the previous year, breaking our existing record. 
We confirmed our 
commitment to renewables
 by opening our first production sites in Italy and Algeria, and developing further initiatives in Italy and abroad. We signed a co-operation agreement with General Electric and the Energy Ministry of Kazakhstan and a Memorandum of Understanding with the Egyptian Ministry of Electricity for the joint construction of new plants. Meanwhile, Project Italy aims to use brownfield sites to generate a total capacity of 220MWp.
Our commitment to tomorrow’s ventures
and various national institutions have joined forces in launching a 
training and employment programme
 offering students two options: a primary-level apprenticeship or a sandwich course (alternating periods of academic study and work experience). The objective is the same in either case: 
to enhance young people’s opportunities for accessing the world of work
 by improving their technical and professional skills. The Protocol of Understanding signed with the Ministries of Education (MIUR) and Labour (MLPS) confirms our strategy of working closely with training institutions, a strategy that already included high-level training courses in the Oil & Gas sector delivered in partnership with polytechnics and universities. In 2017, we stepped up our efforts, involving Italian high-school students in initiatives bringing together schools and businesses. During the 2016-17 academic year, 130 schools entered into work-experience agreements with Eni, while 180 young people were signed up for primary apprenticeships.
In 2017, we achieved 
 that demonstrate how the process of radical change begun in 2014 has transformed into 
a company able to create value
, even in such difficult times as the past three years, when the oil industry has been under severe strain. In 2017, our adjusted operating profit more than doubled, to €5.8 billion, while we posted a net profit of €2.4 billion, following a loss in 2016, thanks to contributions from all our businesses. Our operational cash flow, net of advances received from our Egyptian partners to finance the Zohr development and other non-recurrent items, was a solid €10 billion, 25 per cent up on 2016, showing a surplus of approximately €2.4 billion in respect of net investment worth €7.6 billion. This surplus enabled us to cover more than 80 per cent of the total dividend of €2.9 billion in relation to a price for Brent crude of around $54/barrel; in other words, to ensure full coverage at a Brent crude price of $57/barrel, improving on management’s initial forecast of $60/barrel. Divestments during the financial year, net of the share price relating to repayments of capital expenditure, worked out at €3.8 billion, reducing the cash neutrality from a Brent price of $57/barrel (organic) to $39/barrel. At the end of 2017, the company was in a strong financial position, confirmed by a leverage level of 0.23, well below our ceiling figure of 0.30, despite three-and-a-half years of depressed prices and cash pay-outs of more than €11 billion in dividends over the same period.

Enrico Mattei
Enrico Mattei, Eni’s founder, was a key figure in the history of post-war Italy. His work to develop the country and get its economy back on an even keel had an impact that can still be felt today. 
talent for business strategy, loyalty, closeness to his family and political commitment
 were all fundamental to Mattei achieving his dream. He used the resources of the present to build a new future – with the goal of creating a national energy company. 
He was also a pioneering figure in the cultural arena
: in 1958, he founded the Scuola Mattei and promoted an experimental form of research in Eni’s laboratories in San Donato Milanese. As well as his great talent for business, Mattei also nurtured a genuine passion for art and culture. This led him to entrust poet Attillio Bertolucci with the creation of Gatto Selvatico (‘Wild Cat’) magazine. He was passionate about art and collected a series of paintings, which became treasured artistic assets of the company.
We launched a new formula. We pay the fees the others pay and in addition give the producing country a 50 per cent stake in the production and development of its resources.
Enrico Mattei
Putting people first
Mattei also made sure the company looked after its employees. He built welcoming,
            cutting-edge residential districts, football pitches and swimming pools, and organised
            residences and summer camps at tourist resorts. He would happily use the word ‘family’
            to describe his company’s staff. (The speech is available in Italian only).
The biography: childhood and the quest for independence
Enrico Mattei was born on 29 April 1906 in Acqualagna, in the province of Pesaro, to Antonio Mattei and Angela Galvani. In 1919, his father was promoted from sergeant to marshal in the caribinieri (police), which took the family to Matelica, in the province of Macerata. After elementary school, Enrico attended a technical middle school in Vasto. Financial difficulties within the family and the strict discipline imposed by his father forced him to seek his independence early. His father found him a job at the Scuriatti bed factory as painter, then, in 1923, he was taken on as an apprentice at the Fiore tannery. 
Mattei’s rise within the company was rapid: first as a labourer, then as a laboratory assistant. At just 20 years old, he was promoted to laboratory head
. The higher salary enabled him to help his family and, in 1926, he opened a fabric shop for his mother. In 1927, after military service, he returned to Matelica and became owner of the tannery’s main supplier. Soon, however, the business began to feel the effects of a general economic crisis and it went into decline; in 1929, the tannery closed and Mattei moved to Milan where he set up his first factory with his sister and brother – emulsifying oils for the tanning and textile industries. Thanks to the technical skills he had acquired over the years and his tenacity, in 1934 he founded the Industria Chimica Lombarda, with a factory in Via Tartini, in the industrial suburbs of Milan.
Organisational skills useful for a company and society
In 1936, Enrico Mattei married Greta Paulas, completed an accountancy qualification and enrolled at the Catholic University. In May 1943, he met Giuseppe Spataro, a member of the Christian Democrats, who introduced him to the Milanese leaders of the new party. This brought him into anti-Fascist circles in Milan and, after the fall of Fascism, on 25 July 1943, he joined Marcello Boldrini, an economist at the Catholic University, in the active partisan groups operating in the mountains around Matelica. When he returned to Milan he re-established contact with the local Christian Democratic Party, which in light of his organisational and military skills nominated him commander of the Volunteers for Freedom Corps. This was the first grouping of partisan forces in the Second World War to be recognized by both the Italian Government and the Allies. 1944 saw the creation of a military command for the north of Italy of the National Liberation Committee, of which Mattei was a representative of the Christian Democrats.
An enlightened strategy for a national energy company
In the troubled days following the end of the civil war in Italy, 
Mattei was appointed to liquidate and oversee the substantial privatization of the Italian state-owned company Agip
 – which had been established in 1926 to develop the country’s oil industry. Mattei took a different route to achieve a goal that he considered fundamental: to guarantee Italy a national energy company, able to serve the needs of households and developing small and medium-sized enterprises at lower prices than those of the international oligopolies. He doubled the drilling of wells, enhanced mineral exploration in the Po Valley and made the necessary alliances within the government and the major political parties to support him in realizing his dream. Success came in 1953 with the establishment of – after long and tortuous negotiations that had begun in 1947 between those committed to private initiative and those in favor of strong involvement of the state in the economy. 
Mattei successfully managed to affirm the strategic role of energy for economic development and inspire confidence in the aim of Italian energy independence
. He built an international network that would become one of the strengths that could offer in support of Italy’s diplomatic efforts abroad. Indeed, he was one of the first to cultivate a frontier spirit and show respect for different cultures. On 27 October 1962, on a flight from Catania to Milan, his plane crashed near Bascapè, in the province of Pavia, claiming the lives of Mattei, pilot Irnerio Bertuzzi and the American journalist William McHale.

The centrality of natural gas in a scenario of change
and education
It represents a corporate governance model of excellence spontaneously adopted by Eni, also improving it.
The Corporate Governance Code, together with the By-laws, defines the functions and relations between the bodies of management and control of the Company, also prescribing the general principles of transparency to be observed in relations with shareholders and the market and describing the main features of the internal control and risk management system.
The culture of excellence
adopted the Italian Corporate Governance Code for listed companies, which contains recommendations that constitute a model of "best practices" for the organisation and functioning of Italian listed companies.
Eni’s adherence to the Corporate Governance Code
has adopted the Corporate Governance Code for listed companies since the edition of the 1999 and has adopted solutions, even improving, in order to implement the recommendations of the Code. In 2011 a new edition of the Corporate Governance Code approved by the Corporate Governance Committee was published and adopted by on April 2012. Afterwards, in 2014, the Board adopted the new recommendations of July 2014, ascertaining that corporate governance model was already broadly consistent with the new recommendations. Some of the solutions previously adopted by Eni, were updated to include and specify the role assigned by the Board of Directors to the Chairman of the Board regarding the internal audit function. Lastly, on 25 February 2016, the Board adopted the new recommendations of July 2015, 
related in particular to improve some principles in the matter of corporate social responsibility and corporate control standard on legality and transparency
The updated Corporate Governance Code is available below and shows the solutions adopted by in order to provide the market with a simple and transparent evidence of the choices made by the Company, in line with the best practices of communication. Detailed information on the Code implementation will be given in the annual Corporate Governance Report. For further details on Corporate Governance Code adopted by and on Corporate Governance Committee which approves the Code see the pertinent website.

Mediterranean Energy Perspectives 2018
The centrality of natural gas in a scenario of change
and education
portrait of an historically great company: cooperation, internationalism and sustainability have characterised our activities from the beginning.
From 1953 to 1972: Eni’s first steps
Since its foundation, in 1953, has established very close relationships with people, who over the years developed a strong sense of belonging and pride. Initiatives were introduced to facilitate the activities of workers: in Borca di Cadore and in Cesenatico, holiday villages and colonies were built, and in Rome and San Donato Milanese residential complexes for employees were constructed. 
Within a few years could count on a strong organisational structure, with 56,000 employees, highly-qualified and experienced technicians, cutting-edge research laboratories and a Higher School for Hydrocarbon Studies, established for the training of Italian and foreign managers and executives
. The need to bring energy to the country soon pushed us beyond national borders. In December 1954 an agreement with the Nasser-led Egyptian government shook the foundations of the global oil market. The agreement initiated the direct participation and an equal decision-making role for oil producing countries through the establishment of joint ventures. Three years later, a similar agreement was signed in March 1957 with the Shah of Persia, Reza Phlevi, and the Iranian national oil company, this new formula – which came to be known as the “Mattei Formula” – marked the beginning of a turning point in relations between producer countries and the world’s oil companies.
Eni’s position in the geopolitical landscape in the years of the “Cold War” acquired special importance thanks to the agreement signed in October 1960 with the Soviet Government for the import of Russian crude oil to Italy at very affordable prices. In the same period, manages to open the doors for collaboration with China. 
In 1958 Mattei managed to establish relationships and sign agreements in different areas
. Relations between the East and West were still very fragmented and the contrast with Russia became complicated: Moscow called home its technicians, causing an interruption in the activities at entire production complexes in China. For the implementation of its plans for industrialisation and economic development, China asked for help from Western countries: and Mattei’s Eni, in collaboration with the country, was able to play a delicate and courageous diplomatic role in the dialogue between the parties.
In the following years, decided to adopt a dual strategy: on the oil side by entering into joint venture agreements with a number of foreign companies for the supply of crude oil (Egypt, Iran, Libya, Tunisia). In Italy, meanwhile, it focused on strengthening its position in the energy market with the acquisition of Italgas, in 1967, and the expansion of the petrochemical industry.
From the beginning we have put people at the centre of our activities: for them we began to produce energy and have continued to work with them.
From 1972 to 1998: new agreements and the stock exchange listing 
In this period successive international agreements were made, aimed at expanding the national panorama and dialogue with communities. One signed with the Libyan government in September 1974 was followed by further agreements in Egypt, Nigeria and Tunisia. From 1976 could count on two new oil fields discovered in the British sector of the North Sea. The strategy for the implementation of large transport infrastructure for natural gas transport over long distances turned out to be a determining factor with the construction of a pipeline network of thousands of kilometres in Europe and across the Mediterranean, a project that would have been unimaginable just a few years earlier. 
Extensive exploration and oil and gas production activities enabled to overcome the economic downturn
 caused by the second oil crisis in 1979-80, following that of 1973 provoked by the Yom Kippur War.
 In 1983, with the entry into operation of the Transmed undersea pipeline linking Algeria to Sicily through Tunisia, a new agreement was signed with Libya which focused on the exploitation of Bouri, the largest oil field in the Mediterranean. 
The following year, discovered other fields in Egypt, the Gulf of Mexico and Congo, and consolidated its presence in Nigeria
. In 1988, high quality oil was discovered also in Italy, in the Val d’Agri in Basilicata, the largest onshore oilfield in continental Europe. legislative decree of August 1992 transformed from a state-owned entity into a private company, paving the way for a listing on the Italian Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange at the end of 1995 and the sale, in successive tranches, of shares to institutional investors, private investors and employees.
From 1998 to 2009: internationalisation and sustainability
In these years was obliged to implement a change of strategy in the natural gas market. Following the approval, in the second half of the nineties, of European Union directives for the electricity sector and the natural gas area, 2000 saw the beginning of market liberalisation. In the meanwhile about 70% of Eni’s capital passed into the hands of private shareholders. 
The process was completed with the transformation of the main companies heading up the different sectors into “divisions”, making an all-round operating company
. This led to a more intense process of internationalisation. The development was launched of the most important oil field discovered in the last thirty years, the Kazakh Kashagan Field, in the northern Caspian Sea. In 2003 work began on “Blue Stream” gas pipeline, a joint venture between and Gazprom to transport gas from southern Russia to Ankara, the Turkish capital. The years from 2005 to 2009 saw the development of projects and international agreements, the acquisition of reserves in the most important areas in the world and the strengthening of the company’s leadership in the European gas market. Maximum attention was given to issues of quality, innovation and cooperation, in a word to “sustainability”. And it is precisely in sustainability that is currently at the top of the world rankings, as is confirmed by the numerous awards won at international level, starting from the inclusion in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. Objectives achieved by remaining loyal to the company’s mission of building 
an integrated energy company, committed to growth in oil and natural gas, making cooperation and friendship with the countries in which it operates the strategic driver of its success

For us at Eni, integrity in our operations – taken to mean the safeguarding of people, corporate assets and the environment – is an absolute priority.
We want everything to be safe
Safety is not just a priority, but a value shared by the whole organisation. We deploy all our experience to create a Safety Management System that protects us, our suppliers, our equipment and our processes. Emergencies are managed in a way that put the emphasis on prevention and careful preparation.
An important tool: the E-Working Permit
As part of the digital transformation of Eni, we have undertaken a project to introduce a computer application throughout the organisation. Aligned with national and corporate regulations, this is known as the 
. This tool supports the compilation and archiving of work permits, making it easier for on-site staff to move around with the permissions required by our procedures. Remote operators can also perform some of the steps in this process, ensuring faster and more efficient management of work permits.
The principal benefit of the E-Working Permit is that it 
enhances safety
, bringing local procedures into line with best practice and thus facilitating the execution of processes to conform with company procedures. Its main advantages and characteristics are:
more robust safety measures before starting on specific activities, such operating on pipework or cutting electrical cables;
greater separation of responsibility in compiling the several sections of the permit to work;
standardisation of working practice, as a consequence of the extension of the E-Working Permit to all production sites;
georeferencing of permits to ensure optimal management of interferences and emergencies;
Rationalisation of data storage.

Mediterranean Energy Perspectives 2018
The centrality of natural gas in a scenario of change
and education
History of oil exploration in Italy
revolutionised the Italian oil industry by focusing on innovation, training and international vision.
In Italy oil has been known and used since ancient times. Bitumen and crude oil were extracted from natural outcrops and mines and used in many different ways: from the sealing of boats to medicinal preparations. 
The very term petroleum comes from the medieval Latin “Petrae oleum” meaning “stone oil”
Fuel for modernity
In the mid-nineteenth century American drilling technologies emerged and with the unification of Italy there were increasing attempts to extract hydrocarbons from the subsurface of the Peninsula. The methods were still rudimentary, the companies essentially artisanal and working conditions and environmental consequences harsh: wells were dug manually and to not succumb to the poisonous vapours workers alternated on ten-minute shifts. There were no purification processes and residues were released directly into the soil and watercourses. 
Throughout the nineteenth century the search was particularly for gas for public lighting, but from the beginning of the twentieth century the search began also for oil
, from which to obtain fuel for motor vehicles.
Italian oil exploration, from its beginnings to the birth of Technological innovation, training and an international vision were the pillars from the beginning in our way of working.
The dominance of foreign companies
The First World War and the 1920s marked the beginning of the oil era around the world, with the big European and American companies consolidating their operations in North America, the Middle East, the Caucasus and even in Italy. 
Italy was the first European producer of oil, but the industry was still dominated by foreigners
. Italian industry in general was backward and even more so the oil and energy sector, with small companies operating around the country that began to expand abroad, but without being able to withstand the competition of the big corporations. In these years the major foreign companies also heavily influenced the politics and economy of the country.
The first steps toward a national energy policy
The first attempt to provide Italy with its own oil company came in 1926 with the foundation of Agip - Azienda Generale Italiana Petroli. Although funding was chronically inadequate, Agip was able to conduct its first exploration and extraction operations in Italy and abroad, as well as in the colonies in Africa and the Middle East. 
big change came with the decision to use the most advanced American technologies for exploration, which in fact enabled Agip to discover a large natural gas field in the Po Valley
. However, this was on the brink of the Second World War and Italy was under the influence of Germany, so the government decided to keep the discovery secret waiting for the means and independence to extract the gas without foreign interference.
Eni, the breakthrough: energy for the Italian miracle
After the Second World War Italy was on its knees and the Allies demanded the liquidation of Agip. The government gave the task to Enrico Mattei, based on studies on the Po Valley gas he decided to intensify exploration activities, using the latest technology and sending engineers to study in the United States. These crucial years established the company’s focus on innovation, vocational training and safety at work, moving it definitively on from the pioneering period of the oil industry. The calculations of Agip technicians proves accurate and following the first successful extraction Mattei convinced the government to establish the first large national energy company. 
This was how, in 1953, - Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi, came into being and in the same year also began to distribute natural gas and fuel to households and companies
. Italy finally had the energy in needed to drive its economic miracle, thanks to which it would become the modern country we know today. Having consolidated its success on the national level, in the following years expanded its vision globally by adopting an approach based on cooperation with producing countries, who became involved in mutual development on an equal basis.

Knowledge Management System
The developed by Eni’s upstream is a technological platform that captures, disseminate and enhance the on-the-job knowledge gained by its people.
Creating value of skills
The developed by Eni’s upstream operations is a technological platform that captures and shared on the job knowledge gain by our employees.
Giving value to knowledge
The technical knowledge accumulated by our people is a key asset for the company, which is why in 2004 we adopted a cutting-edge Knowledge Management System (KMS), based on an Enterprise Social Network that captures, shares and enhances skills. At any time and from any place, all of our technicians can access the and interact directly with colleagues worldwide, obtaining immediate support for the resolution of problems.
Careers are an asset for a company
social working tool
Eni’s upstream has a network structure based on 27 Practice Communities and 36 Geographical Units, bringing staff together by operational and geographical areas – from exploration to health and from Norway to Angola. The system was quickly integrated into the daily life of our operators: in 2015 alone the Practice Communities hosted on our system included nearly 60,000 tasks. Horizontal and participatory from the beginning, in 2013 the system was made even more dynamic with the activation of social functions that allow each person at to communicate with colleagues directly from their smartphone. 
By keeping track of these interactions, is able to capture our technical knowledge and then share it through training webinars and content consolidation (Knowledge Nuggets, Innovation Ideas and Technology Application)
. The complete cycle allows for the integrated management of knowledge, the success of which is demonstrated by an exponential increase in traffic. Since the launch of the social features, contributions from all the practice communities have increased more than tenfold, while in 2015 alone about 450 webinars were organised, which were followed by over 20,000 people.
Our Knowledge Management System allows us to align operational subsidiaries abroad with internal standards of excellence and at the same time build a store of technical experience in the field at headquarters
Saving resources and integrating people
The benefits generated by Eni’s have been immediate and strategic. We cut costs thanks to solutions we have developed ourselves, while we contribute to strengthen the company’s identity by involving everyone in the construction of our successes. By enhancing skills and recognizing individual effort and merit, we improve the way we work, enabling us to speed up the dissemination of innovative solutions and avoid the repetition of mistakes.

Mediterranean Energy Perspectives 2018
The centrality of natural gas in a scenario of change
and education
Mediterranean Energy Perspectives (MEP) 2018: energy trends for a sustainable future 
The Mediterranean Energy Observatory (OME) has published a document presenting energy scenarios for the period to 2040. 
Energy in the Mediterranean over the next 20 years
The 2018 Mediterranean Energy Perspectives (MEP) is an in-depth analysis of the energy sector in the region from now until 2040. The document is published by the OME, a Paris-based association of the principal energy companies operating in the Mediterranean basin. It tackles issues of fundamental importance for the region and considers its economic and environmental future.
Energy scenarios: reconciling efficiency with environmental and economic sustainability
The meeting at which the publication was presented, on 4 April 2018, at Eni’s in San Donato Milanese, was attended by Lapo Pistelli, Eni’s director of international relations, Houda Allal, director general, Lisa Guarrera, director of the Modelling & Monitoring Division, and Sohbet Karbuz, director of the Hydrocarbons Sector. The 2018 edition of the presents two energy scenarios. They cover all aspects of the energy industry, based on a model that takes into account the commitments made at the most recent climate conferences in respect of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency:
 considers past trends, current policies and ongoing projects, and incorporates the 
Nationally Determined Contributions
 (NDCs) agreed at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, but assumes that international funding and other aid will not be forthcoming. Only unconditional targets are assumed to be met.
proactive scenario
 is based on the implementation of energy-efficiency programmes and increased diversification of the energy mix based on the NDCs submitted by each country. This scenario assumes that 
international funding will be readily available
Changing energy trends
Ongoing trends in energy consumption will lead to a 
40 per cent increase in demand
 across the region as a whole, while around the Mediterranean basin’s southern shores it is expected to more than double. The energy trajectory must therefore be changed by encouraging implementation of the 
, following through on both 
energy-efficiency
 measures and targets for the deployment of 
renewable energy
. In a proactive scenario, energy demand would be curtailed to a maximum increase of 13 per cent by 2040. The 
fossil-fuel based
, but the share of such fuels could be reduced from the current two-thirds of the total to 
just over half by 2040
The importance of natural gas
There will be increasing reliance on 
natural gas production
, which has nearly doubled since 1990 and will reach itin 2037 before declining to 300 billion m
 in 2040. The region’s 
gas export potential
 will further increase over the next two decades. The strong increase in demand for gas over the past 20 years has had an impact on the region’s energy mix; the share of gas as a percentage of total energy demand increased from 15 per cent in 1990 to 27 per cent in 2015. This is expected to increase further by 2040. 
 will remain the largest gas-consuming sector in the region.
Innovations to develop the grid
Technological, social, economic and political trends have combined to make this a time of exciting 
innovation for electricity systems
 across the Mediterranean. The centralised grid remains a dependable mainstay but faces a period of unprecedented growth and evolution as large-scale renewables and distributed energy resources come online and place 
new demands
Until the early 2000s, renewable-energy technologies were near non-existent in the Mediterranean region, apart from hydropower, biomass and ─ to a lesser extent ─ geothermal. Between 2000 and 2015, non-hydro renewables more than doubled their output. 
 currently stand at a little over 100 Mtoe – about 
 of total Mediterranean energy supply. Renewable technologies already predominate in electricity generation and have an energy capacity greater than that of natural gas. 
, more than two-thirds of the cumulative installed capacity in the proactive scenario (
) will be renewable. This implies adding 
new renewables capacity of 16GW
 per annum over the next 22 years.
Looking to the future with confidence
 will be needed between 2018 and 2040 to cover all the Mediterranean region’s investment needs. Technological innovations and new methods of financing are making 
renewable energy more accessible 
with, for instance, the cost of solar now rivalling that of new thermal power plants. The challenge will be to develop 
new financing structures
 to provide the clean energy industry with greater access to capital to grow and deploy 
renewable technologies on a vast scale
energy efficiency
clean, safe and healthy future
In the proactive scenario, lower demand and decarbonised power generation will lead to a 4 per cent drop in current levels of CO
 emissions (compared with a 36 per cent increase if current trends continue). Over and above the 
, infrastructure requirements and energy bills will be reduced, while the region’s 
energy security will be strengthened
: this last will fall to 24 per cent as early as 2030, as against 44 per cent at present. This will also 
reduce geopolitical tensions
 and stimulate job creation, which will enhance social welfare throughout the region.

Pooling economic resources, but also skills, know-how and experience, allows us to intervene more effectively in the community.
Together for the community
Public and private bodies collaborate for sustainable development. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are a pillar of our Cooperation Model and an essential tool for implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The last of the Agenda’s 17 goals targets PPPs: it is the only goal that doesn't specifically address development, but rather aims to promote the whole programme.
Initiatives for local development with an eye to the world
In the countries where it operates, promotes a broad portfolio of initiatives directed towards fostering local development with a positive long-term impact. These initiatives are designed to be consistent with the 
National Determined Contributions
 (– COP21), with a view to Public-Private Partnership. We have launched strategic collaborations with national and international organisations and institutions, and other local bodies and local cooperation agencies such as the 
, which has enabled us to adapt our procedures to match 
Fighting energy poverty is the first step towards meeting the primary needs associated with education, health and economic development.

Digitalization at Creating value through people, technology and skills.
Digitalization at Creating value through people, technology and skills.
The key to growth
Our business operates in more than 70 countries around the world, employing 33,000 people, and has followed a path of digital transformation for several decades: we’ve been using data for geological research and developing our own algorithms since the 1970s. Our 
 recently saw us launch the industrial supercomputer 
 at the Green Data Center in Ferrera Erbognone, near Pavia, just south of Milan. We see digital transformation as a way of constantly creating value, which improves access to energy, ensures the safety of our plants and workers, strengthens our economic and operational performance and speeds up operating and decision-making processes, all of which will become ever more data-driven
in future. It is a process with roots in the past, but that looks to the future, aiming to make our work ever more integrated and efficient. Our digital transformation covers our entire 
people, technology and skills
, and allows us to achieve extraordinary results. One example of this is Zohr, the largest discovery ever made in the Mediterranean Sea, which recently reached its production targets a year ahead of the original Development Plan.
Digitalization involves complex and algorithmic communication based on the exchange, integration and sharing of information. Our digitalization process covers the entire company.
DESCALZI
has been embracing 
 for the past three decades. It was doing so long before the industry started talking about the subject and over time has managed to turn the need to process large volumes of information into a substantial competitive advantage.
 has always gone hand-in-hand with 
developing the skills of Eni’s staff
, creating a winning blend. The company recently began a far-reaching digital transformation process, involving innovation in workflows
and organisational models
in addition to new technology. In mid-September, a 
was launched to define the company's digital strategy and implement the transformation in an integrated manner right across the business. The unit is responsible for coming up with digital initiatives, including promoting channels for

new digital skills
 and, above all, launching a major 
The courage to integrate and innovate
Digital transformation is a great opportunity for all, requiring a
at every level of the company and an innovative
            approach to work. As a result, in partnership with ECU, a large-scale training
            programme has already been launched.
Numerous digital transformation initiatives are already underway: a 
 aimed at Italian start-ups; the first in-house hackathon;
            innovative operational 
            training programmes to increase knowledge of the digital world; and forging relationships
            with universities to attract new talent. There is much more in the pipeline.
Digital transformation is a virtuous circle: people improve technology and technology improves people’s performance.
Luigi Lusuriello
The increasing use of digital tools to complement the technical experience of staff represents a major change in working practices. is a true pioneer in the development of advanced analytics practices.
The company’s digital transformation in the 
field is based on three elements: artificial intelligence, used to support operational decision-making; 
irtual reality, used to simulate operations; and advanced robotics, used to automate drill deck operations. This transformation will allow us to achieve a trio of major objectives: improved safety on the rigs, better performance and better planning of wells.
At the beginning of this year, Eni, in collaboration with Saipem, completed the full
            digitalization of the 
to be created, enabling a virtual
            reproduction of the well to be constructed and more difficult operations to be simulated
            in a safe environment. The digital twin also improves operational safety and efficiency
            thanks to innovative operational training, which is both quicker to complete and more
For a sustainable and low-carbon future
We believe that digital technology is 
the key to sustainable development
, accelerating economic growth and improving access to energy and environmental protection. We need to adapt to a world that requires increasing amounts of energy, with a growing population and huge imbalances and economic contrasts between different geographical areas. Digital technology can also help us achieve the 
sustainable development goals 
set by the for 2030. Energy has a key role to play in the challenges facing the world, which is why we launched a project in partnership with the Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment to develop a model that identifies the development goals where our 
 can make a difference. Digitalization will allow us to cut 12.1 Gt of CO
by 2030 and will increasingly be the driver behind countries’ 
economic development
HPC4: digital excellence at The Green Data Center is the digital technology hub where we launched HPC4, the most
            powerful supercomputer in the industrial world. It can complete an incredible 22.4
            million billion mathematical operations per second and its calculations aid our exploration
            work. In addition, the Green Data Center is home to a permanent exhibition called
            eMage that allows visitors to explore the topic of digitalization, something which
            has been part of Eni’s from the very beginning.
We need a new model of energy saving with the circular economy at its heart, and which not only leads to a reduction in waste, but also to a reduced demand for raw materials.
DESCALZI
How digitalization is integrated into Eni’s business model
We are an energy company and as such have a responsibility to be 
 in the long term and to make an increasingly positive impact on society. We have always wanted to create added value in the countries where we work: this is known as the 
approach and is based on the conviction that oil-producing countries should be self-sufficient in terms of their energy supply. We see 
access to energy
 as a fundamental tool for the development of the countries where we have a presence and help to develop local energy systems. Two examples of this approach are the 
, which take advantage of local natural gas supplies. In addition, in Ghana, the only non-associated gas development project in sub-Saharan Africa dedicated in its entirety to the domestic market, will guarantee at least 15 years of stable, reliable and affordable gas supplies to the country. Eni’s business model is shaped with the
 creation of long-term value 
in mind, both for the company and for its stakeholders and shareholders. This is based on achieving its profit and growth targets, promoting efficiency and operational excellence and preventing business risk. Today, Eni’s digital transformation is predominantly founded on 
. For this reason, 
innovation and digitalization
 play a key role in our business model and help us look with more confidence to a future based on the

Corporate University
Corporate University is dedicated to the development of technical and managerial knowledge and development and promotion of Eni’s corporate identity and employer brand.
The value of training and resources
We profoundly believe in the value of education. This is why we invest in a structure that integrates tradition (Scuola Mattei) and innovation (distance learning platforms and virtual reality systems) to contribute to the development of our technical and managerial skills and the dissemination of our values.
The value of growth
Since the days of Enrico Mattei, training has played a key role at Eni. The company’s founder had great confidence that people could make a contribution to business development; the early success of was largely due to the speed with which Mattei assembled a formidable network of technicians and managers.
In 1957, he founded the School of Higher Studies in Hydrocarbons, renamed “Scuola Mattei” in 1969, which clearly expressed his strong commitment to training. Since December 2001, the school has been part of Corporate University, founded in the same year to help attract the most talented people and look after their training needs. Corporate University 
is responsible for the selection and training of staff, and for the development and promotion of Eni’s corporate culture
The importance of people and of competences in We carry out training activities to enhance the technical and managerial know-how of staff in Italy and abroad, developing agreements with prestigious Italian and international universities and producing Alternating School-Work projects. These are organised through the Scuola Mattei’s Masters programme in the 
Management and Economics of Energy and the Environment (MEDEA)
We develop Employer Branding - the reputation that the company has built - to spread the corporate identity and attract the best talent in the market to work with us.
We manage the process of recruitment and selection, as well as orientation for new colleagues. Furthermore, it is our role to ensure that the wealth of knowledge that exists across our entire business is shared through a variety of training and development programmes,  so we provide support through the definition and implementation of projects which ensure our people gain and maintain the strategic skills and knowledge which will help us achieve our ambitious business goals.

Competition to find a logo
Enrico Mattei took a gamble on the potential of his country – first on its oil fields and then its gas reserves. From the beginning, the business needed to adopt an advertising image in step with the times. This is the story of that campaign and the creation of a company logo that would makes us instantly recognizable all over the world. It all began with a nationwide competition, strongly supported by Enrico Mattei. Initially the trademark was only supposed to represent the Agip-produced petrol brand Supercortemaggiore, but such was its great success that when was founded the following year, it became the symbol of the wider company.
The six-legged dog: man’s best friend on four wheels
Ettore Scola
Held in May 1952, the competition focused on Agip’s two flagship products, Supercortemaggiore petrol and Agipgas natural gas. Entrants were required to submit two billboard posters, two logos and the livery for a petrol pump. It was open to all Italians and offered total prize money of 10 million lire (about €160,000 in today’s money). The jury was made up of figures from the art world and the media. Within weeks more than 4,000 submissions had been received and the jury had to meet 14 times to select the winner. In September of 1952, the winner was announced: the six-legged dog, a graphic synthesis expressing strength, energy and optimism – values that could be seen in Italy as it underwent an economic miracle.
It was designed by the sculptor Luigi Broggini (although he did not take credit for it) and presented by Giuseppe Guzzi. When it was chosen as the trademark in the same year as the company was founded, it was greeted with astonishment and surprise. But its novelty made the logo an instant hit – lending itself to clever reinterpretation several times since. Naturally, it reminds us of a dog – but also of a Persian lion, walking towards the west with its head turned east. It recalls a chimera in the inclination of its body, boasting a tail unlike that of any dog. But it also resembles a dragon, with spikes along its back and spewing fire from its mouth. Metaphorically, the six-legged dog explores the relationship between man and nature with power, courage and nonconformity.
The history of Italy, the history of The history of Italy, the history of It was not long before the six-legged dog – “man’s best friend on four wheels”, according to the slogan invented by Ettore Scola – became a key element of the company’s signage, familiar due to the rapid spread of service stations on Italian roads, revolutionary in their time for offering high-quality catering to motorists as well as refueling facilities. These were the 1950s, the economic boom had changed and improved conditions across the country. Mass ownership of cars enabled Italians to travel more easily; the dog, which identified service stations and motels, united the north and south of the country. While the economic miracle was underway, was growing and expanding beyond its national borders, from Africa to the Middle East. Geologists, engineers, drillers and technicians moved with their families to Egypt, Iran, Libya and Tunisia. And the six-legged dog that climbed every morning up the flagpoles of platforms and oil fields around the world became the unifying emblem of men and women who shared a passion for challenge.
The 1970s and 1980s: restyling by Bob Noorda
In the years following 1953, the six-legged dog was used to mark all of the company’s activities: from petrol stations designed by the architect Mario Baciocchi to the furniture and furnishings of the Motel Agip chain and from advertising to corporate buildings. After Mattei’s death, the company felt the need to reconfigure the company’s appearance and, in particular, to separate those connected to the car from those meant for people. That philosophy was well expressed by Bob Noorda, who oversaw two redesigns of the six-legged dog in 1972 and 1998: “Otherwise there is the risk that everything will smell of petrol”.
Initially the plan was to create a completely fresh trademark, as well as a new corporate identity for the group. Contact was made with the design agency Unimark, which appointed designer Bob Noorda to study and develop a new communications approach for the network of Agip service stations. While the acronym Agip had not achieved wide popularity, the six-legged dog was already deeply rooted in the Italian collective consciousness; to this point, the dog had been a constant feature of our advertising campaigns, widely used on backgrounds and in a variety of contexts as the managers of distribution outlets and service stations saw fit.
The six-legged dog brandbook
Once it had been decided that the six-legged dog would remain as the central element of the trademark, it was time to standardize the colors, shapes and backgrounds to facilitate use of the symbol for advertising and make it instantly recognizable. At that time, service stations used more or less rectangular signs, supported on poles; the new trademark would need to be such that it could be easily inserted into the existing infrastructure. The solution adopted by Unimark was a yellow square with rounded corners. The now famous six-legged dog was placed inside the box, but had to be slightly shortened and redesigned. Noorda then reworked the Broggini dog to make it more modern: the crest is less pronounced, lessening the suggestion of a chimera or Germanic gryphon, and the eye is round and bigger. less ferocious, more familiar dog...
The new typeface
The most important change of the 1972 redesign concerned the typeface used for text. The original was narrow, tall and difficult to read, especially from a distance; the company’s new font relied on a classic Standard Bold, customized by the insertion of a central white line. “The white line makes the character more dynamic, winding from one letter to another, creating a remarkable continuity, especially in longer words,” explained Bob Noorda, “The symbol that is evoked is that of the street, two traffic lanes separated by a white line.” The height of the logo mirrors that of the capital letter; the background colour on which the six-legged dog rests is 100% yellow, while the color of the flame is red – a combination of 100% yellow and 100% magenta.
The new corporate identity
All companies within the group immediately adopted the new image, which resulted in a strong sense of participation and a corporate identity – anticipated by the pioneering Mattei – was finally achieved. In addition to the dog, now shorter and inserted in the yellow lozenge, there was also the company name, written in full with a capital letter. “The shape of the logo recalls the shape of the six-legged dog and the red dot on the ‘i’ evokes the flame,” added Noorda. Overall, it was a major change that indicated that an acronym had been succeeded by a proper name. It was a choice that would also improve corporate identity and brand awareness.
Up with the times: the new graphic project (re)designed by Bob Noorda
In 1992, as was moving towards privatization, the six-legged dog helped focus the confidence of private and institutional investors. The company was listed on both the Italian Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. As has evolved, so too has the story of the six-legged dog – not merely following history but helping to define it. In 1995, saw a major transformation from national hydrocarbons agency to a public company. The change necessitated a restyle for the brand; having gone public, the company required an image to reflect an agile, modern business organization.
Once again, the company turned to Bob Noorda for a reconfiguration of the corporate image of the Group. The design process was one of progressive abstraction; based on simplification of the key elements, it resulted in more immediate impact and appeal while underlining the value of group unity. The dog is removed from the round-cornered, black-bordered yellow lozenge – which was closely associated with service stations – and is put together with the logo in a perfect square. At its center the square is crossed by a horizontal red line separating the two elements. Another subtle shortening of the dog makes it the exact length of the logo. And the final touch is the addition of the word Group.
Continuous transformation: the “openness” of 2010
has moved with the times, expanding alongside Italy and the Italians. The latest tweak to the trademark is just one reflection of this movement; in 2010 the logo underwent a restyle based on the concept of “openness”. The six-legged dog is the perfect expression of this philosophy. The trademark bridges all the company’s activities, ranging from the distribution of petrol, gas and electricity to production fields and the company’s listing on the stock exchange. The adoption of a single brand name and trademark has encouraged greater cohesion across the various sectors, better cultural homogeneity and also encouraged the emergence of a strong corporate identity – the result of a great history and a great tradition. One such innovation can be seen in the 2010 advertising campaign in which Eni’s six-legged dog emerges from the box and is projected towards a new company reality that communicates dynamism and excitement for the future. The typeface is also new and the characters in lower case to highlight the close relationship that wishes to maintain with suppliers, customers, shareholders and employees.

, and the Chief Executive of Eni, 
Claudio Descalzi
, signed a memorandum of understanding between and the 
United Nations Development Programme
 (UNDP). The main target is to achieve the 
Sustainable Development Goals
 (SDGs) and, in particular, 
universal access to energy by 2030
, actions to combat 
protection, cleaning up and sustainable use of the global ecosystem
. The agreement is unprecedented for the energy sector and underlines the credibility of our efforts and the robustness of our business model. It establishes an innovative model of co-operation between international organisations and energy companies, while at the same time reinforcing an increasingly tangible commitment to development in Africa.
Improving access to energy, especially in Africa, is core to our values, and it is now an intrinsic part of our business. We invest more than half of our budget in Africa, boosting the domestic potential and promoting local development. Today’s MoU, a first for the energy sector, underscores the credibility of our efforts and the soundness of our business model, Mr. Descalzi said.
Claudio Descalzi, Chief Executive, What is the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)?
The United Nations Development Programme is the UN's largest aid programme. Founded in 1965, the works in 
 and has a budget of approximately US$5 billion, financed entirely by voluntary contributions from member states, international organisations and the private sector. It is led by the administrator, 
, who heads an Executive Board of 36 members comprising both industrialised countries and developing countries. The manages aid plans through Country Programmes, which finance projects directed towards attracting investment, training staff and implementing new technologies. 
Strategic Plan 2018-2021
 offers a new strategy to help countries achieve the targets set out in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
The full aims of the agreement
The agreement between and the aims to maximise the benefits for 
sustainable development 
that stem from 
. These could involve renewable energy,
 energy efficiency, reforestation and clean cooking
. The partnership, which involves no financial commitments, is focused on the
, initially involving the countries in which we operate, such as Angola, the Republic of Congo, Egypt, Ghana, Mozambique and Nigeria. The commitment from the focuses on accelerating the positive impact of our company’s initiatives, including improving the regulatory framework, transferring technical skills, providing support for access to guarantee funds for investment in renewables and monitoring/certifying activities.
Achieving Sustainable Development Goal n.7 
Enacted on January 1, 2016, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) –otherwise
            known as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development– serve as the strategic
            blueprint for coordinating policies and activities the global community of nations
            hopes to adopt. Achieving universal access to affordable, clean energy (#7) is a keystone
            of the UN’s sustainable development agenda, serving as a fundamental pillar
            and linchpin for realizing others.

 on climate change. The document was signed in December 2018 at 24 in Katowice by a wide range of environmental organisations, big emissions trading operators and major international energy companies. It aims to consolidate, reinforce and extend the emissions trading system, avoiding double counting due to an absence of sound, shared accounting.

manages the waste generated by activities through process traceability and control of the entire chain and is committed to the scrupulous respect of applicable legislation.
Attention to waste
We manage the waste generated by our activities through process traceability and control of the entire chain.
Waste from production activities generated in 2017 increased by 70% compared to 2016, due both to the contribution of hazardous waste (more than doubled) and non-hazardous waste (+30%). The growth (over 80%) can be traced to the significant increase in hazardous waste from activities linked to drilling, completion and work over for the start of the Zohr project. The disposal of water discharges previously sent to the consortium plant as waste and the new structure of the Centro Oli Val D’Agri at the Southern District also had an impact on the sector trend. Waste from production activities also recorded an increase in the R&sector (+32.8%, equal to over 53,000 tonnes), while it fell significantly in G&(-41.3% equal to approximately -4,650 tonnes). 
In R&MC,
the trend is mainly attributed to the refineries of Taranto, Gela and Venice, as well as the Versalis plants in Porto Marghera, Ragusa and Porto Torres.
 In G&P, the fall is mainly due to trends in the Eni-Power sites of Ravenna, Bolgiano and Livorno. In 2017, 7% of hazardous waste disposed of by was recovered/recycled, 2% was subjected to chemical/physical treatment, 44% was incinerated, 
2% was disposed of in waste dumps and the remaining 45% was sent for other types of disposal
 (including transfer to temporary storage plants prior to final disposal). With regard to non-hazardous waste, 11% was recovered/recycled, 3% was subjected to chemical/ physical treatment, 0.4% was incinerated, 11% was disposed in waste dumps and the remaining 75% was sent for other types of disposal (including transfer to temporary storage plants prior to final disposal).

Climate governance and risk management
The Board of Directors (BoD) plays a central role in managing the main aspects linked to climate change.
The process for managing the risks and opportunities related to climate change is a part of the Integrated Risk Management (IRM) Model developed by to ensure that management takes risk-informed decisions, by taking into full account current and potential future risks, including medium and long-term ones, in the frame of an integrated and comprehensive approach.
On the subject of climate change, the Bois mainly assisted by 
three Board committees
: Sustainability and Scenarios Committee, Control and Risk Committee and Remuneration Committee.
Sustainability and Scenarios Committee
addresses the integration among strategy, evolution scenarios and business sustainability over the medium to long term and examines the scenario for the strategic plan preparation. Set up in 2014, the was the first example, in the Oil & Gas sector, of an integrated approach in the evaluation of sustainability and energy scenarios. In each of the twelve meetings held in 2017, the discussed issues related to climate change and assessed the consistency of the results achieved with the climate objectives.
supports the Boin the quarterly review of the main risks, including climate change.
proposes to the Bothe general criteria for the annual incentive of the and managers with strategic responsibilities, which include specific objectives associated with the reduction of emissions.
The “Energy Solutions” business division, which reports directly to the CEO, was set up in 2015 to develop renewable energies with large-scale projects. In order to identify
 new technological, managerial and strategic solutions
 to support the path to decarbonization, the Climate Change Programme, was also set up in 2015, at top management level with a crosscutting team that reports to a Steering Committee chaired by the In 2016, the Programme’s objective was updated in order to define a roadmap for the medium-long term decarbonization strategy in line with the Paris Agreement goals.
Our Advisory Board
Since the second half of 2017, for a broader view of the factors affecting the value creation in the long term, the Board has set up an Advisory Board, composed by international experts, to further strengthen the monitoring of long-term trends in energy markets, geo-politics, technological innovation, energy transition and the decarbonisation process among which Christiana Figueres, ex Executive Secretary of the Framework Convention on Climate Change.
The CEO’s Short-Term Incentive Plan (STI) includes objectives associated with climate strategy that are consistent with the guidelines defined in the Strategic Plan. This objective is also assigned to top management and managers with responsibilities associated with the emissions reduction.
The process for managing the risks and opportunities related to climate change is a part of the Integrated Risk Management (IRM) Model developed by to ensure that management takes risk-informed decisions, by taking into full account current and potential future risks, including medium and long-term ones, in the frame of an integrated and comprehensive approach. 
Climate change risk is considered a strategic top risk 
by and is analysed, assessed and managed considering 5 reference drivers related to aspects related to the energy transition (market scenario, regulatory and technological evolution, reputational issues) and to physical aspects (extreme / chronic meteo-climatic phenomena). The risk analysis is carried out with an integrated and transversal approach that involves specialized functions and business lines and allows a complete analysis not only of risks but also of opportunities linked to climate change. The following is a representation of the risk factors in a low-carbon scenario for each risk driver with indication of the main mitigation actions implemented by Eni.

Reducing methane emissions: an important global step
Oil and Gas Climate Initiative
 (OGCI) is a project founded in 2014, headed by the chief executives of the oil and gas companies that want to lead the industry’s response to climate change. On 24 September 2018, in New York, the companies in the set their first collective target for reducing the intensity of average Upstream methane emissions, aiming to bring it down from 0.32 per cent (2017) 
to 0.25 per cent by the end of 2025, with the ambition of eventually reaching 0.20 per cent
. Methane has a much greater global warming potential than CO
 and so focusing on this topic is one of the most effective initiatives the industry can undertake. The members also committed to ensuring that methane emissions are kept low throughout the 
gas value chain by promoting partnerships with companies involved in other areas
. At the same event, the welcomed into the organisation three of the largest American oil and gas companies, 
ExxonMobil
Occidental Petroleum
, which together account for 5 per cent of global oil and gas production. Members of the therefore now represent approximately 
30 per cent of global oil and gas production
 and provide almost 20 per cent of the total worldwide primary energy consumption. The
 13 member companies
 represent China, the Middle East, Latin America, Europe and now the United States. The OGCI, with this global reach, is encouraging its members to work hard together in support of the 
companies involved in the OGCI

We are aiming for almost zero methane emissions, to enable us to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement. We are working to turn our ambition into something tangible, feasible and measurable, and so helping to ensure that natural gas can achieve its full potential in a low-emissions future.
The heads of the 13 companies
tangible commitment, measurable over time
As part of the day a report entitled ‘
At Work: Committed to Climate Action
’ was presented, highlighting the activities already underway to achieve the initiatives’ objectives. These include the 
 fund, launched in 2016 to finance companies developing technologies and business models to help reduce climate-altering gas emissions. As for the future, the is starting work on a series of actions that together should help reach the 17 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.
We get more ambitious every year and, as well as welcoming three new companies, we are also continuing to promote and strengthen specific actions to fight climate change
The heads of the 13 companies
Eni’s commitment to reducing methane emissions
played a leading role in tabling and finalising the methane intensity reduction target. We are committed to reducing methane emissions, which are predominantly produced in the 
Upstream sector
. Thanks to our ongoing implementation of on-site campaigns, we have recorded a reduction of almost 2 million tonnes of CO
 equivalent compared to the estimated 2014 value and 
 we are aiming to 
reduce fugitive methane emissions by 80 per cent
 compared to 2014.
OCGI: catalyst for a sustainable future
Climate change is a global challenge. The Oil & Gas Climate Initiative was
            created to find solutions for that challenge. When the Paris Agreement came into effect
            in 2017, reiterated its support for global action and emphasised the need for
            urgency. Each Oil & Gas company is acting to reduce emissions, but the most impact
            will be reached by working together and partnering with others. can be a catalyst
            for change, helping to reduce emissions, and making the world’s energy system
            fit for a sustainable future.
Investments for low emission technologies
The chief executives of the companies that make up the and Climate Investments, met on 27 October 2017 in London and outlined their ambitions for a future with almost zero methane emissions and announced the 
investments in low emission technologies and projects
On 4 November 2016, the Climate Investments scheme was announced in London: over the next decade, and the other companies involved will finance 
, initiatives and technological solutions to help reduce emissions. Through Investments, companies in the oil and gas sector have committed themselves to playing a key role in the reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions while continuing to supply energy. The Climate Investments is a unique strategic alliance 
with the environment at its heart
 and decarbonisation as the ultimate goal. Ithas a and a board and actively participates as a shareholder. The aim is 
to promote the use of new technologies and identify different ways of reducing energy consumption in the transport and industrial sectors
. The largest companies in the world – all competitors – have decided to work together. They will share resources and skills and play a key role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Oil and gas industry leaders have a critical role to play in our efforts to take on climate change and limit the global temperature rise. We are counting on groups, such as OGCI, to support the needed shift in the way that we produce and consume energy.

 London on research that aims to 
provide a more accurate picture of total greenhouse gas emissions across the natural gas value chain
, from well to distribution. This will identify emission hotspots that will allow to focus its efforts on areas that could bring the greatest benefits.

Employee Well-being
has always been a company that cares. We constantly aim to look after our people, the territories and communities we work in, and the partners we work with so that we create a sense of shared values. 
The Well-being of our People
offers a broad range of initiatives and services to support the personal and professional lives of our colleagues.
 is a crucial concept in Eni’s strategic vision. Focusing on people is a core value; part of our This is the reason why has invested in welfare initiatives over the years and in important areas for our people including family, health and well-being.
Supporting the family is a fundamental element in Eni’s welfare programme. Here are some initiatives we provide to help people with their work/life balance:
0-6 is the company’s pre-school nursery that was set up in 2010. It offers a model experience based on a world-class educational approach that provides maximum flexibility (12 months a year, Monday to Friday with extended opening times). 0-6 is currently available in San Donato Milanese, but we are looking at ways of extending this to other locations.
Summer trips for the children of employees (from 6 to 14 years old) are rooted in Eni’s history. They take place at various seaside and mountain locations across Italy under the supervision of qualified teachers and feature many diverse recreational activities, sports and educational workshops. 
Summer Camp
Our summer camp for 15 and 16 year olds is like an extended study tour with a tailored English language programme. It’s a chance to mix culture, nature and learning!
Support for care givers
Fragibility was made available in 2017: This initiative is dedicated to caregivers, the people who every day - in addition to their work - take care of disabled or non self-sufficient family members. It is a service built around the Italian network and integrated with qualified operators. It is configured as a point of contact providing information and orientation about disability and non self-sufficiency issues.
Health and Well-being
The health of our people and their families is a fundamental value for Eni. In this context, promotes specific prevention campaigns in qualified structures located throughout the country, such as:
Early Diagnosi: cancer prevention screening differentiated by age and gender implemented on a national scale in collaboration with the Italian Fight Against Cancer Organisation.
Prevention with : mini check-ups with cancer screening and blood tests in facilities of excellence located throughout the country.
invests in the quality of professional life and the promotion of models and styles of life to encourage people's well-being every day. This, for example, is behind the considerable attention dedicated to company catering services (choice of ingredients, menus in keeping with nutritional indications, care for environments) and the Well-Being Programme offering discounted access to various sports facilities. 
 All the more, in 2017, our efforts on behalf of the health of our staff continued through:
the process of identification, monitoring and control of risks at work even if not specifically regulated in close connection with the industrial process and health surveillance;
the implementation of the corporate health infrastructure standardization program through the census and verification of structural, functional and equipment requirements and subsequent identification of corrective action.
The regulatory and management system for such activities backs up Eni's commitment in the following 5 areas:
 - Occupational Healt and Industrial Hygiene
 - Healthcare and traveller health
 - Management of medical emergencies
 - Health for the communities
Other Initiatives
The Well-being Programme also includes initiatives that help to bring people and the company closer together (such as the “Snow Trophy”, a winter event which mixes winter sports, nature and social events, and “Eninsieme”, a day where our children are encouraged to come into work with us).
As of 2017, offered employees the opportunity to access the tax and social security opportunities envisaged in current legislation as regards flexible benefits, thereby allowing the conversion of part of the participation premium into welfare credit Employees are given the chance to define - according to their own specific needs - an individual set of goods and services (social security and health funds, welfare services, educational and training services, recreational, social assistance, consumer goods and facilities) made available through a dedicated web platform that also allows access to a broad offering of convention agreements with partner companies involving major brands in the main commercial areas. 
Starting in 2017, some of our people began experimenting with smart working - a tool designed to promote better reconciliation between professional and private sphere requirements and save time in terms of travel, thereby also ensuring a benefit even in terms of impact on the environment.

They provide an extensive toolkit for the dissemination of knowledge and include chatrooms, webinars, document collections, search engines and other materials. 
In particular, in the upstream sector, where the wealth of highly specialised know-how is a vital asset for Eni, we have adopted a cutting-edge knowledge management system based on a next-generation enterprise social network
. At any time and in any place, all our technicians can interact directly with colleagues from around the world, getting immediate support for the resolution of a problem.
Communities of Practice have proven to be the most effective way of sharing and developing knowledge and are one of the main tools for Eni’s knowledge management initiatives. Each Community of Practice consists of 
a group of people who share knowledge and issues related to a theme or a specific discipline
 and enhance their knowledge and experience through mutual interaction. The year 2017 was characterized by the consolidation of knowledge management activities through the streamlining of existing communities with the aim of strengthening the sharing processes on complementary know-how areas. In line with the organization model, there has been a gradual extension and strengthening of initiatives on cross-cutting know-how and business support.

Managing Oil Spill 
We manage Oil Spill  in order to ensure the protection of the environment and actively participate in international prevention initiatives.
Oil Spill management to protect the environment 
In recent years there has been a reduction in the volume of spills, in particular in the Exploration & Production sector.
The number of oil spills fell significantly in 2017, both in terms of operational spills and spills from sabotage. However, the volume of operational spills (3,228 barrels) has increased since 2016 due to the leak in a storage tank in the Val d’Agri Oil Centre occurred at the beginning of February. 
As of today, almost the total volume spilled on the site has been recovered.
 In 2017, the number of barrels spilled in operational oil spills (more than 90% referable to the E&sector) has increased compared with 2016, mainly due to losses from a crude oil storage tank in the Centro Olio Val d’Agri identified at the start of February. By the end of 2017 more than 2,400 barrels of oil had been recovered, almost the total volume of the spill from the tank. As a consequence of this event, the E&rate of operational/production oil spill increased significantly to 3.04 barrels/million barrels. In 2017, there was a reduction in the number of incidents by sabotage (-35% compared to 2016) and volume spilled (-31% compared to 2016); spills over a barrel are exclusively related to upstream activities in Nigeria, where, thanks to the commitment deployed to deal with these events, an 18% decrease was recorded in barrels spilled and a 29% decrease in events (for more info visit Sustainability website). The barrels spilled as a result of the chemical spill in 2017 are attributed to the E&activity in Norway. 
To be highlighted the positive break between 2015 and the following years
, which marks the positive convergence of all efforts on all possible actions (see the following paragraph).
Preventative action
The strategy aimed at reducing operational oil spills and oil theft has been outlined through an increasingly joint action on all the possible intervention plans, from the administrative to the technical prevention aspects, control and quality / speed of intervention, also through participation in several international initiatives. It deserves to be mentioned the project e-(Vibroacous Pipeline Monitoring System), started as a research project and it became a patented product to be tested. It has been adopted in the Nigerian context (35 Km installed on the Ogbainbiri-Tebidaba line) and it will be further developed (eVPMS-project) in order 
to detect vibrations from ground excavation and to anticipate the intervention before a potential break of the pipeline
. In Nigeria, the decisive factors of the positive trend (end of 2015) were the following:
the intensification of 50% of pedestrians (thanks also to the support of local communities)
the use of "light aircraft" (+ 46% compared to 2016) and drones to short-range for the surveillance of assets
the installation of passive protection
the improvement in the oil spill management process, also in administrative / contractual terms, which have allowed a reduction in the contractors’ mobilization times.
Support for spill pipeline emergencies
" for R&pipeline network which, through a risk analysis of the territories crossed by the pipelines, it allows to identify the points of greatest attention on which to structure intervention plans to increase the response of the operators.

Controls and Risks
The Internal Control and Risk Management System (ICRMS) is a set of tools, organisational structures, regulations and business rules put in place to facilitate the sound management of the Company in line with the business goals set by the Board of Directors. It provides proper means for the identification, measurement, management and monitoring of risks, while also ensuring that information is circulated as appropriate.
Actors and the three levels of control
The is structured along the following three levels of internal control:
first level of control: identifies, assesses, manages and monitors the risks for which it is responsible, for which it identifies and implements specific management actions;
second level of control: monitors the main risks in order to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of their management; also responsible for monitoring the appropriateness and operation of controls implemented for the main risks. It also provides support to the first level in defining and implementing adequate systems for managing the main risks and the associated controls;
third level of control: provides independent, objective assurance on the appropriateness and effective operation of the first and second control levels and, more generally, on the as a whole.
The structure of the first and second control levels is consistent with the size, complexity, specific risk profile and with the regulatory environment in which each company operates.
The third level of control is exercised by the Internal Audit Unit of SpA, which, on the basis of a centralised model, performs its controls using a risk-based approach to the overall ICRMS, monitoring Spand the subsidiaries.
Regulatory System
To ensure the integrity, transparency, propriety and effectiveness of its processes, adopts rules for the performance of business activities and the exercise of powers, guaranteeing observance of the general principles of traceability and segregation.
Each component of that system is supplemented by the Company’s Code of Ethics, which identifies the fundamental values, among others, of the formal and substantive legitimacy of the conduct of the members of corporate bodies and all employees, and transparency, also in term of accounting, and the dissemination of a mentality directed at the exercise of control.

On July 28, 2010, Eni’s Board of Directors approved the basic guidelines for the New Regulatory System, with the goal of rationalising, supplementing and simplifying Eni’s regulatory system.
On June 23, 2016 Eni’s Board of Directors approved an update of the Fundamental Guidelines to bring the Regulatory System into line with Eni’s current organisational structure, better integrating it with corporate processes and making it easier or the subsidiaries to use.
Anti-Corruption Compliance Programme
To address the high risks faced by the company in carrying out its activities, has adopted an Anti-Corruption Compliance Programme – a system of rules and controls first introduced in 2009 aimed to prevent corruption in line with the principle of “zero tolerance” outlined in Eni’s Code of Ethics and international best practice. In particular, Spand all its subsidiaries in Italy and abroad are required to adopt and implement the Anti-Corruption Management System Guidelines approved by Eni’s Board of Directors in 2014 aimed at preventing all forms of corruption involving both public officials and private parties. The company’s anti-corruption compliance programme is further strengthened and updated, with a view to continuous improvement, by taking account of best practices . Moreover, does everything it can to ensure that entities and companies not controlled comply with Eni’s anti-corruption standards. The Anti-Corruption Compliance Unit, which manages specialist activities to ensure the effectiveness of the Compliance Programme for Spand its unlisted subsidiaries in Italy and abroad, reports to the SpExecutive Vice President Integrated Compliance Department. The Unit is responsible for the verification of due diligence assessments with regard to the integrity, professional reliability and reputation of potential contractual partners, in the management of “red flags” (or warning signs) and the drafting of contractual principals in areas at risk of corruption. It makes regular reports to the controlling bodies and the Watch Structure of SpTo make the strategy for combating corruption even more effective, invests in continuous training programmes in Italy and abroad aimed at ensuring that staff have sufficient awareness about anti-corruption laws and internal regulations on anti-corruption. It also provides guidance on how to recognise and manage red flags. Disciplinary measures against employees as well as legal action and remedial measures in respect of contractual parties are foreseen in the event of violations.
On January 2017, obtained the 37001:2016 "Antibribery Management Systems" certificate of conformity of Spfor its Anti-Corruption Compliance Program, the first international standard for the management of antibribery systems. The verification process was conducted by the certification company Services SpA, leading certification body in Italy.

This also applies to those with even de facto management and control responsibilities (such as senior managers) and to anyone subject to the direction or supervision of all the people mentioned above.

At the same time when Model 231 was adopted, Eni’s Board of Directors created also a Supervisory Board (“Watch Structure”) to oversee the Model’s effectiveness to report on its implementation to the top management. The Watch Structure is made up of internal and external members, including the Chairman, with specific requirements. The same Watch Structure performs the functions of Guarantor of the Code of Ethics.
