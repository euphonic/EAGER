) is a very busy man. An extreme sports photographer to the max, he has recently worked on a slew of different projects where he's captured freeride skiing in Alaska, street football in Paris, motorcycle riding in the U.S., and mountain biking in Australia.
The content of Dominique's camera case depends on the job at hand. Generally, he has two Canon cameras (a 1DMK3 and a 5DMK2) and multiple lenses. He stresses the importance of good memory cards, believing the speed and capacity of the card is vital, especially when taking action shots. Photographers simply cannot afford to miss a shot because their memory card is full or the buffer was overloaded. Because losing or destroying an image is the worst thing that can happen, Dominique always travels with two copies of his photos and in two different places.
If he could, he would store all of his pictures on his Extreme® memory cards since they provide the most stable storage mechanism. It's for this reason that he re-uses his oldest cards as storage devices.

He shoots major sporting events for the NFL, MLB, and more, and his photographs appear in daily newspapers, magazines and online outlets across the nation. In 2006 he received the "Dodger Photographer of the Year" award.
To capture the defining moments, Jeff depends heavily on speed: his own and that of his equipment. Racing up and down the sidelines, predicting both teams' next plays to capture the shot that counts, he uses his Canon 1Mark digital camera, eight Extreme® flash memory cards and the burst mode on his camera. This mode depends on both a speedy camera and high-performance cards to capture as many images as possible within a few seconds. When the game is over, it's critical that Jeff's photos are processed and uploaded very fast so his images arrive to the news agencies first.
Jeff relies on creativity and fast, durable Extreme memory cards to get the winning shot.

) picked up a camera because of his love of the wild landscape of British Columbia, not intending to one day shoot photos that would win awards or be splashed across the front pages of the world’s most widely circulated newspapers and magazines.
His initial motivation was simply to capture images of the beautiful natural world, and it soon became second nature for him to pack a Nikon along with his pitons or waders. It didn’t take long, however, before his passion for photography blossomed into a career.
After starting with weekly newspapers near Vancouver, he was soon working with big city dailies and international news wires. He says today that he didn’t have much choice in the matter. “love making pictures, and the camera chose me. just hung onto my camera straps and went along for the ride.”
And what a ride it was. It kicked into high gear in 1979 when, at the age of 22, Nick joined United Press Canada (the affiliate in Canada). He traveled widely for the next five years, chasing global news events on assignment in North and South America as well as in Europe. In 1985 he moved to the newly formed Reuters News Pictures Service in Brussels, Belgium later transferring to London, England as Deputy Chief Photographer for the United Kingdom and Ireland.
Nick was the Reuters Journalist of the Year in 1988, the first time it was awarded to a Reuters photojournalist. He was also nominated twice for a Pulitzer. After living out of a suitcase for nearly ten years, running from one global hotspot to another, Nick was drawn back to British Columbia, where he joined The Vancouver Sun in 1990.
Nick is a pioneer in digital photography (he gave up film cameras in 1994 for digital cameras), and in 2001 he left newspapers to start a digital photo and consulting business, specializing in digital photography, videography, web design, and social media consulting.
In his 40 years as a professional photographer, Nick has covered Olympics, Super Bowls, Stanley Cup Finals, Super Power Summits, Royal Tours, natural disasters, riots and other conflicts. His photography has appeared on the front pages of many of the world's major newspapers and magazines, including the International Herald Tribune, The New York Times, The Times of London, The Sydney Morning Herald, Stern, Time, Newsweek, Vanity Fair and Rolling Stone.

 proudly recognizes Mr. Steve McCurry as a Extreme Team Legend for his timeless efforts and iconic contributions within the global photography community.
Steve McCurry has been one of the most iconic voices in contemporary photography for more than 30 years, with scores of magazine and book covers, over a dozen books, and countless exhibitions around the world to his name.
Born in a suburb of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, McCurry studied film at Pennsylvania State University, before going on to work for a local newspaper. After several years of freelance work, McCurry made his first of what would become many trips to India. Traveling with little more than a bag of clothes and another of film, he made his way across the subcontinent, exploring the country with his camera.
It was after several months of travel that he found himself crossing the border into Pakistan. There, a group of refugees from Afghanistan smuggled him across the border into their country, just as the Russian invasion was closing the country to all western journalists. Emerging in traditional dress, with full beard and weather-worn features after weeks embedded with the Mujahideen, McCurry brought the world the first images of the conflict in Afghanistan, putting a human face to the issue.
Since then, McCurry has gone on to create stunning images from over six continents and countless countries. His work spans conflicts, vanishing cultures, ancient traditions and contemporary culture alike; yet it always retains the human element that made his celebrated photograph of “The Afghan Girl” such a powerful image.
McCurry has been recognized with some of the most prestigious awards in the industry, including the Robert Capa Gold Medal, National Press Photographers Award, and an unprecedented four first-prize awards from the World Press Photo Contest.
