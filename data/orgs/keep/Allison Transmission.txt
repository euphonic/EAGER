Throughout our long history, has been a leader in innovation, creativity and continually pushing toward new advances in technology. Our heritage, starting in 1915 with James Allison, has been strong and steady throughout the decades that we’ve been creating fully automatic transmissions.
We were there from the beginning, with the invention of the world’s first heavy-duty automatic transmission, and even now is the premier designer, developer and manufacturer of medium- and heavy-duty fully automatic transmissions and hybrid propulsion systems.
Our experience and longstanding history have made the brand to trust. Read below to learn more about our history and heritage.
James establishes the Speedway Team Company to support his Indianapolis 500 racing activities. From the very beginning, quality and workmanship are the foundation of the company's business philosophy; and this quote by Jim hung on a sign in the shop: "Whatever leaves this shop over my name must be of the finest work possible." James is also one of the four founders of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, which opened in 1909.
One day after World War is declared, James instructs his Speedway Team Company to cease all activities associated with race cars. He informs the media that the Indianapolis 500 will be cancelled until the war ends. Shortly thereafter, the Speedway Team Company applies its automotive engineering expertise toward the United States' war effort.
Mr. commits his shop's resources to support the war effort and undertakes a series of design modifications to existing military equipment. As part of those early developments, the Speedway Team Company focuses on high-speed crawler-type tractors for hauling artillery and battlefield equipment, Whippet tank components, tank tracks, production superchargers and reduction gearboxes.
The Speedway Team Company changes its name to the Engineering Company. By this time, Allison's reputation for quality is firmly established and the company receives recognition from the Bureau of Aircraft Production for its Liberty aircraft engines.
Soon after the end of World War I, Engineering is producing precision reduction-gear assemblies for the nation's Liberty aircraft engines, "V-drive marine gears," that allow a level-mounted engine to drive a yacht angled prop shaft, four-cylinder generator sets, and 12-cylinder marine engines which produces 425 hp.

Front-engine buses with xtechnology deliver fuel savings and lower operating costs.
SÃPAULO, Brazil – paves the way for new solutions to urban passenger transportation in Brazil, with fully automatic transmissions delivering smooth operation, lower cost of ownership and improved efficiency.
3000 Series™ equipped Agrale and Mercedes-Benz buses are the latest to feature xtechnology. Optimized gear ratios coupled with the FuelSense® Max package allow the torque converter to lock-up at lower speeds, improving fuel economy by up to 7 percent.
Agrale offers its 17 bus with the 3000 Series with xand an integrated hydraulic retarder. “automatic transmissions, when coupled with our buses, deliver gains in many ways. They make operation easier by reducing driver fatigue – shifting requires no intervention, especially in stop-and-go traffic and rough terrain,” said Silvan Poloni, Agrale’s corporate sales manager.
“They also translate into greater comfort for passengers. For the company, the automatic brings meaningful economic benefits because they collaborate with the reduction of operational and maintenance costs, and guarantee greater productivity and availability of the vehicle,” Poloni said.
In addition, the 3000 Series is now available in the Mercedes-Benz OF1721chassis, which was recently displayed at the booth at the Lat.Bus & Transpublico 2018, the Latin America Transport trade-show.
"Automatic transmissions bring great advantages to transportation companies, which go from optimizing maintenance to greater powertrain durability. The driver gains more driving comfort as well as enhanced attention to the traffic. Passengers, on the other hand, gain on-board well-being due to softer shifting,” said Walter Barbosa, director of bus sales and marketing for Mercedes-Benz Brazil.
Designed to accommodate up to 13.2 meter bodies, the OF1721 front engine configuration with air suspension has wide applications including use as a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) feeder, for continuous charter as an employee transport and for occasional tourist charters and short-distance transportation.
"The availability of the automatic for the OF1721chassis allows Mercedes-Benz to offer customers more options to configure their buses according to their demands and operation features," Barbosa said.
The Agrale 17 chassis with front-engine and fully automatic is already successful in Argentina, and drives interest from other markets in South America. The version for the Brazilian market has been set up for three doors, is up to 13.2 meters in length and features air suspension.
Allison's decades-long experience in Argentina shows that Allison-equipped buses provide a smoother and quieter ride for passengers and drivers because the engines work at lower speeds. Automatics enable buses to keep pace with traffic and to brake and resume speed quickly, which is essential in congested cities.
(NYSE: ALSN) is the world’s largest manufacturer of fully automatic transmissions for medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles and is a leader in electric hybrid-propulsion systems for city buses. transmissions are used in a variety of applications including refuse, construction, fire, distribution, bus, motorhomes, defense and energy.
