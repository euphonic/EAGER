Let’s face it. We live in a world where today’s consumers are more fickle than ever and instant gratification is the norm. Whether it’s an online shopping website that recommends a new product that can easily be purchased with a simple click, a banking application that notifies you of fraud in real-time, or a video streaming service that allows you to binge watch your favorite programs, having an optimal digital experience — no matter the industry — is a critical competitive differentiator and is now a requirement for sustained success.
Digital and the delivery of digital services has become business critical. We see this across every industry, and in a new survey conducted with 1,000 global business leaders, almost all were in agreement that implementing a digital strategy, maximizing its performance and doing it sooner, rather than later, is critical to their future success.
As companies bet their futures on their digital transformation initiatives, the stakes have gone way up.  Delivering a great end user experience is imperative, and ensuring security has become more critical than ever  - and increasingly become a ‘team sport’.  Security is top of mind for every network manager today.
With all of the talk these days about machine learning, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, one might forget that humans are still the most important piece of the future puzzle.
This morning, like so many, began my work day by leaving the house, opening Waze, a real-traffic app, planning my commute to the office. As was walking in, checked my calendar on my phone.
In my industry, we talk a lot about digital transformations. Companies of all sizes and across all industries are beginning to recognize that a new approach to – a complete shift, really – is creating new opportunities to reset competitive advantage, stimulate sales growth, improve customer retention and increase employee productivity.
Digital transformation is happening, and it’s happening in a big way. By 2021, expects that at least 50% of global will be digitized1 . To propel these digital initiatives forward, enterprises will invest an estimated $2.1 trillion in cloud, mobile, IoT, and other next-generation technologies over the next few years alone2.
Networks within an enterprise tend to start off their lives as fairly simple structures, but over time they grow in size, scope and overall complexity. In fact, today, most large network and application infrastructures are incredibly complex and sprawl across the globe, making it ever harder for overworked information (IT) teams to pinpoint and troubleshoot issues when they arise with traditional approaches.
The frontline of digital transformation is the edge—remote sites where the majority of employees work. These locations come in all shapes and sizes, including retail stores, regional sales offices, customer service centers, banks, manufacturing plants, warehouses—even government buildings and military installations.
Today, we are all on a digital journey, and a strong foundation is essential in maximizing digital performance that transforms businesses, industries and the user experience.

Deliver Superior Digital Experiences to All Your Users, Across All Your Applications and Devices
Eliminate blind spots with end-to-end visibility
End users, apps, networks, and infrastructure are more distributed than ever before. And that means it is harder than ever before to manage the performance of applications and the user experience. Point monitoring tools are of limited use as they provide insight into only one area.
Riverbed’s digital experience management solution unifies user experience, application, infrastructure, and network visibility to monitor and proactively improve performance. Whether you are a cloud architect, operations expert, or application owner, provides the data and the insights to help you do your job more effectively than ever before.

What is Your Performance Maturity?
  Gain a complete view of the digital experience
You need a clear understanding of how digital services are performing and impacting the business. This includes capturing the perspective that matters most: your end users’. Riverbed’s solution collects detailed performance analytics across all devices, apps, networks, and infrastructure for a holistic view of the digital experience of your customers, employees, partners, and suppliers.
These metrics are then blended and correlated to provide role-specific insights for all your stakeholders, revealing adoption patterns and impacts on revenue, productivity, and user satisfaction.
  Consistently deliver high-performing digital services  
Performance problems can pop up anywhere across the software development lifecycle and complex application delivery chains. But with powerful analytics spanning all domains, you can proactively identify and resolve problems before they negatively impact end users and the business.
Unified views of performance enhance cross-team collaboration when troubleshooting issues, leading to faster mean time to repair and freeing your teams to focus on optimizing digital service delivery.
  Develop frequent, high-quality releases
Pinpointing opportunities for developing new or improved features is critical for customer satisfaction and retention. provides business-relevant insights to help you prioritize development efforts and ensure new releases continue to meet user and business requirements.
And by integrating performance monitoring into your DevOps tool chain, teams can move faster without sacrificing quality by detecting and resolving code-level bugs, predicting service behavior in various environments, and ensuring new releases are optimized for production.
We have insights into the performance of our applications that we never had before. This is incredibly valuable, because it can improve our users’ productivity, and remove problems for customers in branches that can directly impact revenue.
