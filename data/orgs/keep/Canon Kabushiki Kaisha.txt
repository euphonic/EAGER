grand strategic transformation to become an Excellent Global Corporation of the highest order
2017 marked Canon’s 80th anniversary. It was an epoch-making year in which we continued Phase of our Excellent Global Corporation Plan (2016 – 2020) and established a strong foundation for the grand strategic transformation of our business portfolio. Between our existing businesses, which have continually supported us with solid earnings, and the expansion of our new businesses that will drive future growth, our sales exceeded 4 trillion yen ($36.1 billion*) for the first time since the financial crisis of 2008. Furthermore, for the first time in four years, we registered an increase in both sales and profits.
Toward achieving our grand strategic transformation, we are focused on our four new businesses of commercial printing, network cameras, healthcare and industrial equipment. Through collaboration with Group company Océ, our commercial printing business is growing to meet the diversifying needs of the expanding digital printing market. In our network camera business, which is growing mainly in the areas of security and surveillance, we are achieving synergies with Group companies Axis and Milestone Systems, enabling us to propose network visual solutions based on a combination of superior technologies in such areas as video content analysis. Our work in healthcare centers on Medical Systems, which joined the Group in December 2016 as Toshiba Medical Systems and adopted its new name in January 2018. We are expanding our business in diagnostic imaging, healthcare and in-vitro diagnostic systems. Lastly, in our industrial equipment business—which includes Tokki, the market leader in Organic (OLED) panel manufacturing equipment—we are combining our strengths from across the entire Group to develop new manufacturing systems that will play a vital role in next-generation manufacturing.
With the advancement of such technologies as the IoT, big data and AI, the world is on the cusp of a revolution in product usage and manufacturing methods. While continuing to pursue innovation in such longstanding business segments as cameras, inkjet printers and office multifunction devices, we are striving to improve productivity through automation and in-house development of software.
Since Canon’s foundation, we have continued to pass down our corporate of enterprising spirit and the San-ji, or "Three Selfs," Spirit. And under our corporate philosophy of kyosei, we seek to become a truly excellent company that is admired and respected around the world. Toward this end, we will continue working together as a Group to become an Excellent Global Corporation of the highest order.

Nanoimprint opens a new door to the future of digital society
Located in western Japan, Toshiba Memory Corporation’s Yokkaichi Operations plant stands at the forefront of semiconductor memory production. Here, verification is underway for the application of Canon’s nanoimprint technology for the mass production of semiconductor devices. The miniaturization of circuit patterns has brought dramatic improvement to semiconductor memory performance and capacity. In recent years, however, the conventional approach of using light to transfer the circuit patterns onto chips appears to be approaching a technological limit. To overcome this hurdle to further miniaturization, has developed semiconductor lithography equipment that employs an innovative approach called nanoimprint lithography, which is gaining recognition not only for its nano-level precision, but also for the relative compactness of the equipment used, which can significantly reduce semiconductor manufacturing costs.
Using nanoimprint technology to manufacture next-generation flash memory
Nanoimprint lithography equipment designed for mass production of semiconductor devices
Development of nanoimprint technology at Utsunomiya Optical Products Plant
With the advent of the age of the Internet of Things (IoT), where everything will be connected to the internet, all kinds of objects will be equipped with such semiconductor devices as sensors and communication devices, memory for data storage and processors for that analyze big data. Demand is ever increasing for these semiconductor devices as they become even more vital to society.
Semiconductor devices evolve through miniaturization, or narrowing the circuit line widths and increasing the density of circuit patterns on the device. Advances in semiconductor lithography equipment are the key to achieving this miniaturization and reducing manufacturing costs. Conventionally, miniaturization was achieved by shortening the wavelength of the light source used when exposing the device. The technological limit of this method, however, appears to have been reached, making an innovative new approach necessary.
Canon, together with Nanotechnologies, has developed a method that eliminates the projection lens used to reduce and project circuit patterns, replacing it with a mold, called a mask, onto which circuit patterns are transferred. The mask is pressed like a stamp onto a resist on the wafer surface and Canon’s state-of-the-art control and measuring technologies, which we have cultivated through the development of semiconductor lithography equipment, make it possible to faithfully reproduce high-resolution patterns. What’s more, this approach is less complex than conventional methods, which allows the equipment to be more compact.
To commercialize this nanoimprint lithography equipment, developed technologies that ensure nano-level defect control, overlay accuracy and the elimination of foreign particles. Even compared with the latest conventional lithography technology—Extreme Ultraviolet, or EUV—our nanoimprint systems can significantly reduce manufacturing costs. Expectations are high that this equipment will serve to manufacture the next generation of flash memory.

Research on genotyping assays at BioMedical (below)
Canon’s healthcare business in the United States is at the vanguard of a revolution in medical research. To keep research and development on the leading edge, we maintain a strong commitment to open innovation. At U.S.A.’s Healthcare Optics Research Laboratory in Boston, Massachusetts, the company conducts joint research with two Harvard Medical School teaching affiliates—Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital—to develop medical devices such as medical robotics and cardiovascular endoscopes. Using Canon’s advanced micro-optics fabrication technology, we are developing an ultra-miniature endoscope less than 1 mm in diameter. Despite being extremely thin, this endoscope is expected to be robust enough to resist breaking when inserted in a patient’s body, enabling real-time observation of such previously inaccessible anatomies as the insides of joints and paranasal cavities. In the field of medical robotics, we are developing a needle-guiding system that assists with percutaneous procedures by accurately navigating position and depth. This device has shown great promise for near-future applications, including improving the precision of biopsies, use in cancer ablation therapy and for reducing treatment times.
Japan’s Ministry of Health honors the world’s first X-ray scanner that captures the movement of organs
The Aquilion X-ray scanner was awarded the Japan Medical Research Development Award at the 2017 Japan Medical Research and Development Grand Prize Awards ceremony. The Awards are given in recognition of contributions to medicine. The system realizes high image quality while reducing patient radiation doses, minimizing the use of contrast agents and contributing to faster diagnoses. In addition to morphological scanning of organs, it performs functional scanning, an imaging method that reveals the dynamic movement of the heart and blood flow.

Many of Andi’s customers operate globally and thus need to print such documents as manuals in multiple languages, often in short runs, for which only the language of the text needs to be changed. Andi had been struggling to provide this kind of work efficiently with conventional offset printing equipment.
As a result, Andi, which has very high standards for print quality, introduced digital printing presses from and Océ to improve the productivity of their printing operations. Our digital printing presses enable companies to respond efficiently to a wide range of customer printing needs, such as short-run production, quick turnaround and variable-data printing that makes possible the output of content that varies by sheet—all of which are difficult to provide with offset printing.
The combined strength of and Océ promotes the digitalization of commercial printing
The Asahi Shimbun Company is developing a new business using the variable-data printing capabilities of Océ continuous feed presses
Sheet-fed press manufacturing at an Océ factory in Venlo, the Netherlands
Commercial printing is a vast industry, covering a wide range of printed materials—from books, newspapers and magazines to such promotional materials as sales catalogs, flyers, direct mail and the statements, invoices and other documents that are crucial to running a business. For decades, offset printing, which involves the laborious process of creating printing plates, has been the dominant technology. However, digital printing does not require printing plates—an advantage that continues to drive increased demand. Digital printing also offers such benefits as variable-data printing, which enables users to change the content of individual sheets in a print job. Such flexibility gives businesses the ability to serve customers who need short-run production and quick turnaround.
Océ, who joined the Group in 2010, is a leading provider of digital printing presses, producing systems that realize both high productivity and outstanding reliability. As “One Canon,” and Océ offer products and services for both office and commercial printing while continuing to expand our lineup of printing presses. For the graphic arts market, which has strict quality standards for the printing of such media as catalogs and promotional materials, we launched the Océ ProStream 1000 continuous feed inkjet press in 2017. This inkjet printing press is capable of high-speed printing on offset coated paper that rivals the quality and productivity of traditional offset printing.
Raising the productivity of printing companies and making inroads into new business fields

For printing companies, digital printing provides numerous advantages over conventional offset printing. These include centralized workflow management that streamlines the entire process from the receipt of orders to the editing of print data and process control and coordination of such post-press processes as binding. and Océ’s workflow management software enables seamless schedule management of multiple presses and allocation of printing jobs, increasing the productivity of short-run production significantly.
To help printing companies experience the advantages of digital printing firsthand, and Océ opened Customer Experience Centers in the Netherlands, Germany, the United States and Japan. Equipped with our latest commercial printing presses, these facilities allow printing companies to conduct tests with the paper and data that they commonly use to see the high-quality results our digital equipment and software provide. We also offer support for the implementation of digital printing systems, including hands-on training for operators.
and Océ’s innovation in digital printing technology extends beyond paper-printed material. Our curable flatbed printers can print on wood, metal and glass surfaces. What’s more, we are actively pursuing R&with plans to enter the vast package printing market.
Océ elevated printing technology helps create a faithful replica of a 3300-year-old pharaoh’s tomb
The tomb of the 19th Dynasty pharaoh Seti is the largest and deepest in the Valley of the Kings. Until an NPO-initiated reconstruction plan began in 2016, the inner walls and pillars embellished with reliefs were in disarray from tomb robbery and neglect. First, 3photographs and scans were taken of the interior of the tomb. Based on those images, full color prints and molds were made with Océ’s UV-ink-based elevated printing technology. This enabled the faithful reproduction of reliefs up to 15 mm thick, and a 2 mm relief skin of the pharaoh’s sarcophagus.

The History of 1933 - 1961
1976 - 1987
The name carries such meanings as "holy scripture" and "criterion or standard of judgment." It effectively captures Canon’s corporate spirit, which aims to set a global standard for advanced technologies and service while becoming a criterion in the industry to which others will aspire. The logo, introduced in 1935, has undergone several changes as the company has grown. Despite these modifications, the strong character reflected in the sweeping inward stroke of the "C" has remained intact from the day that the company was founded. Striving for consistency in communication since day one has greatly contributed to the worldwide trust that the brand enjoys today.
Today, the logo, with its vivid red color, is familiar to people around the world. However, the logo underwent a number of changes before reaching its present form.
In 1933, when Precision Optical Instruments Laboratory was established, the name given to cameras manufactured on a trial basis at the time was Kwanon. This title reflected the benevolence of Kwanon, the Buddhist Goddess of Mercy, and embodied the Company's vision of creating the best cameras in the world. The logo included the word with an image of "Kwanon with 1,000 Arms" and flames.
When the Company sought to begin full-scale marketing, it needed a brand name that would be accepted by people worldwide. From this standpoint, in 1935 the name was registered as the official trademark. The word has a number of meanings, including scriptures, criterion and standard. The trademark was therefore worthy of a company involved with precision equipment, where accuracy is fundamentally important. It also embodied the Company's desire to meet world-class criteria and industry standards. And since and Kwanon had similar pronunciations, the transition went smoothly.
designer specializing in advertising created the original logo in 1935. The "C" was unique in that its top end curved inward, ending in a sharp point. This style of typeface did not then exist in Europe or North America. The name and logo were created to reflect the Company's global perspectives, which it adopted right from the beginning of its history.
Precision Optical Instruments Laboratory underwent several name changes before the adoption of Camera Co., Inc., in 1947. This change was significant in that brand and company names were unified for the first time in its history. Several versions of the logo were also used, until a unified version was created in 1953. After further refinements, the logo used today was perfected in 1955. It has remained unchanged for nearly half a century.
The engraved Kwanon logo was used on cameras trial-manufactured by the Company (but not actually released in the market).
The logo is registered as a trademark. Prominent features were already inherent in the refinement process.
Unification of the logo. The image was further refined to achieve an overall balance.
The current logo was the culmination of painstaking and meticulous design efforts.

The corporate philosophy of kyosei that adopted in 1988 helped to formalize this concept. formulated the Group Activity Policy in 2012 to express the Group’s commitment to social contribution as a corporate citizen. Under this policy, tries to utilize its strengths effectively to conduct its activities in accordance with the needs of each country and region where it operates.

For specialized topics, such as quality assurance, environmental protection, information management, or compliance, the respective division in charge provides employee training as required. By incorporating training for newly appointed managers that provides an overview of trends and Canon’s initiatives, is also working to develop managers from both technical and administrative fields with a broad perspective. In addition, managers at Group companies worldwide share information and work closely together on initiatives.
Canon’s Supply Chain and the Fulfillment of its Social Responsibility
In recent years, the environment, human rights and labor issues have been topics of increasing attention, and various stakeholders are calling into question the scope of our social responsibility initiatives across our supply chain.
According to news reports, their concerns about manufacturers with respect to social responsibility likely stems from large numbers of manufacturing companies in such industries as sports, apparel and electronic products outsourcing their sewing, assembly and manufacturing operations to outside factories. Furthermore, the social responsibility expected of manufacturers has expanded in scope to encompass large, medium and small size suppliers that provide parts and materials to factories.
places great importance on manufacturing, engaging in product assembly as well as the production of certain components, parts and materials at its own plants, factories and Group manufacturing companies that bear the name and are owned by Inc. directly or indirectly. The manufacturing companies in the Group are located in such countries and regions as Japan, China, Taiwan, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam, the United States and Europe, and supply products to Inc. and companies including Group marketing subsidiaries and affiliates. These manufacturing companies directly employ considerable numbers of employees and are administrated by Inc., which acts as the head of the Group.
Group manufacturing companies conduct business while adhering to Group policies regarding such matters as human rights, labor, the environment, legal compliance, procurement and security, including the “Group Basic Statement,” the “Group Code of Conduct” and the “Group Environmental Charter.” When necessary, each administrative office, product operation headquarters and auditing office at Inc. verify the situation at Group companies as a whole, be they in Japan or overseas, from the standpoints of internal controls and risk management.
The Group offices, factories and manufacturing companies are engaged in partnerships with several thousand suppliers unaffiliated with the Group, from whom they purchase considerable numbers of such components as electronic parts, mechanical parts, units and materials. Procurement divisions at Inc. headquarters and Group manufacturing companies periodically review and evaluate the social responsibility of these suppliers. In particular, may choose to terminate business with suppliers if they fail to abide by laws and ordinances covering such areas as human rights and labor. In 2018, established the “ Supplier Guidelines ” in order to clarify the social responsibility standards suppliers must adhere to. also requires that these companies urge their own upstream suppliers to do the same.
Among aspects of social responsibility, child labor and forced labor in particular are areas of growing concern. Within the scope of our 2017 survey of Group companies and suppliers, no problems were found with respect to child labor or forced labor.
Canon’s Supply Chain
Identifying and Reviewing Materiality
To reliably meet the expectations of its stakeholders, makes efforts to confirm the validity of its CSR-related materiality.
Identifying Materiality
conducts questionnaire surveys to ascertain stakeholder expectations. Through analysis of survey results alongside past initiatives and medium- to long-term management plans, we identify materiality themes that should be addressed. In 2017, we identified “Responding to people and society as a good corporate citizen” as a new materiality theme. Under this theme, is actively working towards solutions to the problems faced by global society by promoting “Creating new value and solving social issues” and “Protecting and conserving the global environment”. In the environmental field, also identifies materiality at the topic level as stipulated in the Standards.
Materiality Identification Process
Stakeholder Questionnaire Survey
carries out stakeholder questionnaire surveys once a year in order to better understand the social issues stakeholders are interested in as well as the expectations they have of the Company. Based on the results of these surveys, confirms the validity of its materiality topics and makes an appropriate review. In addition, these surveys help analyze its impact on society and further improve its activities. Furthermore, has explored the opinions of stakeholders regarding the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the United Nations in 2015, which we expect will help in expanding our future activities.
Consumers, suppliers, investors and analysts, NGOs and NPOs, persons affiliated with universities and research organizations, national and local governments in Japan, the Americas, Europe and Asia
surveyed stakeholders on their expectations of the Company with regard to ten themes of importance to within a wide range of social issues, including items outlined by standards. We ascertained that stakeholder interest in “Initiatives that contribute to protection and conservation of the global environment” and “Leveraging technology and expertise to solve social issues and create new value,” remains high, as in the previous year.

Canon’s Approach to Risk Management
Inc. recognizes that the improvement and implementation of a risk management system to deal with serious risks that the Group may face in the course of business is extremely important to ensure the proper operation of the Group and to continually improve corporate value.
Risk Management System
Inc. has established a risk management committee based on a resolution of the Board of Directors. Chaired by the Executive Vice President, the committee has established three subcommittees: the Financial Risk Management Subcommittee, Compliance Subcommittee, and Business Risk Management Subcommittee.
The Risk Management Committee develops various measures to promote the Group’s risk management activities, including identifying any significant risks (violations of laws and regulations, inappropriate financial reporting, quality issues or information leaks, etc.) that the Group may face in the course of business.
The committee also creates an annual basic policy for risk management activities and, after obtaining the approval of the Board of Directors, carries out risk management activities within Inc. divisions and Group companies. The committee evaluates the improvement and implementation of the risk management system for each division and Group company, and reports the results of such evaluations to the and Board of Directors. Results of evaluations conducted in 2017 showed no major flaws in the system.
In line with the basic policy prepared by the committee, in their capacity as risk management promotion officer, the heads of Inc. divisions and presidents of Group companies each formulate an annual risk management plan for their own division or Group company, and assume responsibility for promoting related risk management activities. Risk management promoters appointed within each division and Group company assist risk management promotion officers in coordinating risk management practices.
Additionally, Inc. administrative divisions with jurisdiction over miscellaneous risks associated with business activities, including the legal division, human resources division, security trade control division, and quality assurance division, control and support the risk management activities of each division and Group company.
Processes for Improvement and Implementation of Risk Management System
Risk Management Promotion System
Group-Wide Risk Management Communication
During training for newly appointed Group executives conducted by the human resources division, Inc. educates them on the importance of autonomously improving and implementing a risk management system at each company and the role of executives in improving and implementing such system.
Similarly, when the human resources division conducts training for newly appointed general managers and managers, it educates them on the importance of the system to manage legal risk and the role of management in constructing such system.
In addition, an intranet website provides employees of Inc. and Group companies with timely information, including the Group’s approach regarding risk management and updates on activities.
Financial Risk Management
The Financial Risk Management Subcommittee carries out activities to strengthen internal controls pertaining to financial risks for the entire Group, including compliance with Japan’s Companies Act and Financial Instruments and Exchange Act as well as the United States’ Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
We endeavor to make qualitative improvements in ensuring the reliability of the Group’s financial reporting. We support independent initiatives and self-driven educational activities at Group companies as they implement the cycle (review business procedures for financial risk).
As a result of these initiatives, Canon’s accounting auditor determined that the company’s internal controls related to financial reporting were effective in fiscal 2017.
The Compliance Subcommittee works to promote corporate ethics across the Group in accordance with the Group Code of Conduct, and to improve the Group’s legal risk management system.

Promoting Corporate Ethics
Group Code of Conduct and Compliance Card
established the Code of Conduct in 1992, and later updated it as the Group Code of Conduct in 2001. It clarifies the Group’s management stance and standards that Group executives and employees must comply with in their duties. In addition to Japanese, the Code of Conduct has been translated into many languages, including English, French and Chinese, and adopted by a resolution of the Board of Directors of each Group company, which also strives to ensure that it is known and practiced by all.
In addition, a portable Compliance Card has been created in Japanese and many other languages, including English, French and Chinese, and given out to Group executives and employees inside and outside Japan. Written on one side of the card is the San-ji (Three Selfs) Spirit, which has been the guiding principle of the company since its founding, and on the other side is a compliance test that enables employees to carry out self-questioning of their actions on a daily basis.
Compliance Card
Corporate Ethics and Compliance Training
Inc. carries out corporate ethics and compliance training for employees suited to the circumstances and conditions of the region where they operate.
For example, Inc. conducts corporate ethics and compliance training as part of rank-based training for newly appointed general managers and managers as well as new employees.
Additionally, Inc. and its subsidiaries in Japan have since 2004 designated a Compliance Week twice a year— once in the first half of the year and the other in the second half—in order to foster discussions in the workplace about compliance issues. Through these efforts, we strive to develop and improve operational processes to ensure that employees are aware of compliance and abide by the law.
Whistleblower System
Inc. has established a hotline to receive information related to compliance issues. The confidentiality of callers is strictly maintained, and they are guaranteed not to suffer any unfair treatment for using the hotline. We continually work to encourage use of the system by raising awareness of the hotline services, using such means as an intranet compliance website and compliance training.
Hotlines have been established at nearly all Group companies inside and outside Japan. Inc. receives regular reports from Group companies on the operational status of their whistleblower system.
Legal Risk Management System
At Canon, we have identified significant legal risks that the Group may face in the course of business (for example, violations of anti-trust laws, anti-bribery laws and export control regulations) by considering the potential likelihood and impacts on Canon’s business. To minimize these risks, we are working to improve a system to ensure legal compliance by improving operational workflows and rules, providing training on laws for related employees, and conducting audits and checks.
Strict Compliance with Export Control Regulations
Inc. has established a security trade control framework headed by the president and overseen by the Foreign Trade Legal Division within the Global Logistics Management Center. This ensures that we can implement proper security trade controls in compliance with strict regulations on the export of goods and technologies for civil use that could be diverted for use in weapons of mass destruction or conventional weaponry.
The Foreign Trade Legal Division works with divisions involved with individual goods and technologies to double-check such issues as whether export goods and technologies are controlled by regulations, or whether counterparties are engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction. We have also established and revised Security Trade Control Guidelines, and hold regular briefings and training sessions for relevant persons at Inc. and Group companies in Japan to further educate employees about the importance of security trade control. We also provide Group companies with templates for company rules, training materials for employees, and support via the help desk to help these companies establish control frameworks and rules.
Such thorough internal controls at each Group company ensure that the Group doesn’t violate security trade control laws. Inc. has also maintained a bulk export license from Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry continuously since 1990. This license is granted only to exporters who exercise strict controls.
Training on Security Trade Control in 2017
Expatriates
Compliance with Anti-Trust Laws
recognizes that compliance with anti-trust laws, which apply to all of its business activities, from product development to production, sales and after-sales service, is absolutely vital.
Business divisions of Inc. and sales and service companies of the Group inside and outside Japan conduct regular training for employees of divisions exposed to the risk of anti-trust violations to educate them about anti-trust laws, give examples of legal violations, and provide everyday operational compliance guidance. Employees are encouraged to make use of Canon’s anti-trust law hotline (connected to the Legal Division) when unsure of how to interpret or apply anti-trust laws.
Prevention of Bribery
The Group Code of Conduct clearly stipulates that will not receive benefits in the form of gifts or entertainment that exceed the social norm, or provide similar benefits to other parties.
carries out regular training for employees of divisions involved with negotiations between public officials and business partners to inform them about the latest regulatory trends (including provisions to prevent bribery of public officials outside Japan) in major countries and details of the Code of Conduct.
Promoting Business Risk Management
The Business Risk Management Subcommittee is responsible for mitigating serious operational risks.
Action policies and plans for each serious risk are decided in cooperation with the responsible administrative divisions for the entire group and implemented throughout Inc. business divisions and Group companies, along with the promotion of risk mitigation activities.
Ensuring Complete Information Security
Recognizing that information security is a vital management task, has established an appropriate management system for the entire Group, in accordance with the fundamental principles of information security regulations. The steps that we take under this system include measures to prevent leaks of confidential information, handle external cyberattacks, bolster information security at production facilities, and provide information security training to raise employee awareness.
Since 2005, has had external certification, ISO27001, for its information security management systems.
Information Security Management System Operations
The Information Security Committee is the decision-making body for information security measures at Canon. It is chaired by the senior executive with responsibility for information security, namely the Group Executive in charge of the Information & Communication Systems Headquarters. The latter is responsible for implementing measures determined by the Information Security Committee to manage this issue across the Group.
If an information security incident occurs, the matter must be reported to the Information & Communication Systems Headquarters. It may also be reported to the Risk Management Committee, depending on circumstances.
The Information & Communication Systems Headquarters formulated the Group Information Security Rules to ensure the same level of measures and a consistent approach to information security are applied across the Group globally. Each Group company creates regulations and guidelines based on these rules in line with its needs, and conducts related training and awareness activities. Periodic inspections are also carried out to assess the status of each Group company’s information security measures and enable improvements or revisions as needed.
In 2017, information security checks were carried out at 21 Group companies in Japan and 19 Group companies overseas. These inspections found that each company’s system was sound and in good working order.
will maintain an expedient and smooth communication channel with its Group companies and make every effort to ensure that its mechanisms can identify and remedy issues based on regular information security checks.
CSIRT*, a dedicated team for dealing with information security incidents, was created within Inc.’s Information & Communication Systems Headquarters in 2015. At that time, joined the Nippon Association (NCA) to strengthen collaboration with CSIRTs in other companies.
plans to reinforce its information security systems further by strengthening countermeasures in response to information security incidents, while also seeking to prevent more widespread damage by developing early-detection capabilities and promoting collaboration with outside organizations.
* CSIRT: Computer Security Incident Response Team. This is a dedicated, organized group that deals with incidents involving computer security.
Global Information Security System Organization
Information System Security Measures
implements measures to safeguard the three elements of information security: confidentiality, integrity, and availability*1.
As part of measures to prevent the leakage of confidential data, we ensure the most important information is stored using a dedicated, access-controlled system with reinforced security and auto-recorded user activity. In addition, we have established an environment in which employees can safely access the company’s information assets while away on a business trip, and we have also placed restrictions on email attachments and taking company computers and storage media offsite.
As part of measures against cyberattacks, we use monitoring systems to identify any suspicious emails with possible malware*2 attachments. We also attempt to monitor unauthorized online communications from internal sources as part of stopping attacks from causing more widespread damage.
In 2018, we also plan to initiate further risk mitigation measures in anticipation of a heightened risk of cyberattacks ahead of Rugby World Cup 2019™, Japan and the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020.
*1 Confidentiality: Enable only authorized personnel to access information.
Integrity: Ensure data and processing methods are accurate and cannot be modified without authorization.
Availability: Make data accessible to authorized personnel when needed.
*2 Malware: malicious software (including computer viruses and ransomware) created with the deliberate intention of performing unauthorized or harmful operations
Security Measures for Production Facilities
implements security measures for its production facilities to ensure malware, cyberattacks or other information security issues do not reduce productive capacity or otherwise disrupt production plans.
In the past, corporate mainframes or online information systems were the major targets for cyberattacks. Today, the growing use of off-the-shelf software and networks means that production facilities attract the same level of information security risk. separate approach is needed for production systems because production lead-times are longer than the customer support periods for off-the-shelf software. In 2017, we began undertaking critical information security audits for Inc. and Group production companies in Japan. We also began monitoring the networks linked to important facilities and production lines for any unauthorized activity.
We plan to extend these measures to Group production companies based overseas to ensure Group production facilities worldwide can operate safely without disruption.
Information Security Training to Raise Employee Awareness
In order to maintain and improve information security, is focusing on raising awareness among the employees who use information systems.
Both regular and mid-career hires are thoroughly trained on Canon’s information security measures and rules through group training. In addition, all employees undergo annual information security training using our e-learning system.
In 2017, roughly 26,000 employees—equivalent to Inc.’s total workforce—received information security training. This included training to develop information security literacy*, including how to deal with suspicious emails, measures to prevent email misdirection, and other protocols. In addition, special training sessions based on a targeted email attack were conducted involving roughly 71,000 Inc. and Group company employees to provide practical instruction in responding appropriately to suspicious emails so widespread damage is avoided.
* Information security literacy: knowledge and skills needed to implement proper information security measures
Protecting Personal Information
recognizes that personal information is an important asset, and that protecting this asset is one of its social responsibilities.
At Inc., we have created rules to safeguard personal information, including a Personal Information Protection Policy and Personal Information Protection Rules, and conduct training and audits regularly as part of our system to prevent leaks of information.
Starting in 2015, we expanded the scope of these activities to include all Group companies, creating a centralized management system covering the entire Group. As a result, there were no incidents involving the loss or leakage of personal information at Inc. or any of its Group companies in 2017. did not receive any privacy infringement complaints from customers in 2017.
Inc. and Group companies in Japan have also implemented measures to deal with Japan’s new Social Security and Tax Number System (referred to as the “My Number” system), which was introduced in Japan in 2016, in an appropriate manner. To this end, the entire Group in Japan formulated My Number Handling Rules, My Number Regulations, and a detailed handling procedure manual. In particular, our measures regarding physical and technological security are more stringent than those mandated by law, and we continue to collaborate with the division on this matter.
Going forward, will regularly monitor its management of ”My Number” and other personal information while reviewing operations as needed to make appropriate improvements.
Bolstering Physical Security
Aiming to strengthen physical security, has been working to establish physical-security systems at each of its operational sites based on the following three policies:
● Establish and put into practice at operational sites an overall design from the viewpoint of crime prevention, disaster prevention, and safety to optimize entry and exit routes for all persons.
● Fully implement strict internal and external security measures to comprehensively prevent company assets (physical objects, information, etc.) from being removed, suspicious objects from being brought in, and suspicious individuals from entering.
● Limit entry to certain areas to people who have been authorized by area managers, and integrate management of room entry and exit logs.
Physical Security Promotion System
has established Security Guidelines that outline policies and rules regarding room entry and exit management and other aspects of physical security. We have also been proactively implementing security measures according to these guidelines, and revising the guidelines as needed. Each site is now responsible for drafting a self-checklist that complies with the guidelines and also takes into account the unique security risks of each region in order to check the adequacy of its security protocols. In this way, each site implements security measures tailored to changes in its own environment.
In addition, the Group has adopted an Integrated Entry and Exit Management System and a control system that comprehensively manage surveillance cameras and sensors as part of Canon’s efforts to strengthen physical security across the entire Group.
Due to the serious risk to society posed by toxic materials, we have developed a particularly thorough audit system, covering all Group sites in Japan. Improvements and revisions to toxic materials security measures are implemented based on audit results.
Learning from the terrorist incidents in Paris and Belgium, has stepped up its security efforts in order to quickly detect suspicious persons and suspicious objects with the aim of preventing indiscriminate terrorist attacks against companies considered to be soft targets. We are also working more closely with the police, fire departments, and other government agencies to heighten vigilance in detecting risks.
Post-Disaster Business Continuity Plan
Responding to the Risk of Damage to Infrastructure
believes that establishing a system to ensure that business operations can continue after a natural disaster or emergency represents one of the most important social responsibilities of any company. Based on this recognition, we have formulated a business continuity plan (BCP)*1 and Group Disaster Preparedness Guidelines, and are working hard on advancing business continuity measures for disasters, including upgrading buildings constructed according to old aseismic design standards, concluding disaster agreements with local communities, and developing systems for collecting information and reporting.
Due to the critical importance of our Shimomaruko headquarters in Tokyo, Japan, as the home base for all Group operations, we have rebuilt all on-site buildings, established a crisis control center, installed backup generators, stockpiled fuel, equipment, and supplies, and established a multiplex communication system. Moreover, we set up a Disaster Recovery Center*2 to back up information systems to ensure that the core system will operate securely in the event of a disaster.
We have updated all Group company facilities in Japan, setting up emergency communications equipment and support structures, and inculcated a sense of readiness in our employees through practical disaster-preparedness training. We also have systems that use data from surveillance cameras installed at each Group site so any damage caused by natural disasters or other emergencies can be evaluated swiftly. Furthermore, we have prepared a leader’s manual in order to safeguard human life immediately following a natural disaster or fire, prevent secondary disasters, and protect company assets. Using this manual as a model, Group companies are also creating localized manuals based on the unique risks in the areas where they operate to facilitate the smooth restoration of services in the event of a disaster. Last year, 35 operational sites conducted 36 emergency drills based on these manuals.
*1 Business Continuity Plan (BCP): an action plan that includes measures to provide for the continuation of a minimal level of business in the event of fire, accident, or other such event, and to restore operations promptly
*2 Disaster Recovery Center: a facility prepared for data backup in the event of a system breakdown due to a disaster
System to Promote Responses to Infrastructure Disaster Risk and Goals
Conduct drills to verify that manuals prepared by individual sites are effective. Revise manual where there are shortcomings to improve ability to respond in an emergency.
Each operational site to conduct a drill once a year

In line with the request of the Disaster Prevention Section of Ota Ward, under the agreement, our newest facilities, including a lecture hall, gymnasium and heliport, can be offered in the case of an emergency situation. We will continue to work closely with local governments to fulfill the role of a disaster-response base in the local community.
Disaster Agreement with Susono City, Shizuoka Prefecture
In July 2016, Inc.’s Fuji-Susono Research Park concluded a disaster agreement with Susono City, Shizuoka Prefecture, offering support in the event of a major disaster. Susono City is working to create an urban environment resilient to disaster. Under the agreement, if there is a major earthquake in Susono City, the two parties will offer mutual support and cooperate in relief and recovery activities, such as providing food aid and permission to travel along designated disaster roads.

has formulated and widely published its Procurement Policy, and is endeavoring to build good relations with suppliers by deepening their understanding of Canon’s basic stance toward procurement.
In keeping with its corporate philosophy of kyosei, carries out procurement activities that give due consideration to society while also continually taking steps to further evolve its ecofriendly green procurement*2 practices.
*1 concept: This is Canon’s basic product development policy. “E” stands for environment: Companies are not qualified to manufacture goods if they are incapable of environmental assurance. “Q” stands for quality: Companies are not qualified to market goods if they are incapable of providing quality products. “C” and “D” stand for cost and delivery: Companies are not qualified to compete if they are incapable of meeting cost and delivery requirements.
*2 Green procurement: Favoring the procurement of materials and products that have a lower environmental impact.
Following its corporate philosophy of kyosei, aims, as a truly global company, to contribute to the prosperity and wellbeing of the world by developing, manufacturing and marketing useful products, raising profits, and achieving sound corporate growth and development.
The Procurement Division adopts a global perspective in purchasing quality, appropriately priced merchandise in a timely manner. This facilitates improvements in product quality and reductions in prices, and positions us to work with our suppliers to meet customer needs.
We comply with all applicable laws and regulations as well as corporate ethics, and operate in a manner that is protective of the environment.
We are open to any and all suppliers, and promote fair and free competition in accordance with the principles of faith and trust.
We improve manufacturing by mutual growth with reliable, quality suppliers, which are selected through a fair evaluation process.
Reinforcing Compliance in Procurement
not only complies with laws and regulations on procurement globally, but also ensures complete fairness and transparency in dealings with its suppliers.
Specifically, the Group Procurement Code of Conduct for Executives and Employees in Charge of Procurement outlines appropriate actions that persons in charge of procurement as well as executives and employees responsible for placing orders should keep closely in mind in order to maintain high standards when it comes to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Also, Canon’s business processes are uniform across its global network based on a common set of detailed rules on procurement practices in place for Group companies both inside and outside Japan.
To ensure consistency and uniformity across the company, special internal controls sections have been set up within procurement divisions to maintain the rules, monitor compliance, and provide training for employees.
Main Procurement Compliance Initiatives
Upgraded existing procurement code of conduct and formulated Group Procurement Code of Conduct for Executives and Employees in Charge of Procurement
Promoting Open Procurement to Companies Worldwide

operates the Suppliers Proposal Site within its main company website with the purpose of collecting information, including products handled and manufacturing consignment information, from companies worldwide (excluding intellectual property such as designs, ideas and inventions). Products proposed on this site are now being used in products.
We will continue to give careful consideration to all future proposals based on established rules.
In a world of increasingly global supply chains, many social and environmental problems have been identified, including the use of forced or child labor and issues relating to environmental protection, which mainly affect emerging economies.
We formulated the Supplier Guidelines to promote socially responsible procurement across the Group in partnership with suppliers. Together we engage in global procurement activities that take into account human rights, labor, health and safety, compliance and the environment to promote sustainable procurement across the entire supply chain.
We have set up a channel to receive feedback from suppliers. On our website, suppliers can submit opinions and requests by sending a message on the page entitled “We welcome your comments on our Activities.”
Pursuant to the Group Basic Procurement Policy and the Group Basic Statement, we set forth the Supplier Guidelines to promote global procurement activities that take social needs into full consideration. Accordingly, we ask our suppliers to conduct the below initiatives

(1) Respect fundamental human rights of employees and do not discriminate against them based on such factors as race, nationality, gender, religion, and creed

(5) Pay employees wages equal to or greater than legally mandated wages in accordance with the laws and regulations of the country/region of location

Request to your suppliers for their cooperation
(1) Request to your suppliers that they cooperate with initiatives for social responsibility, including those that concern human rights, labor, safety, legal compliance, the environment and product quality/safety
Supplier Evaluations and Ongoing Surveys Incorporating Environmental and Social Perspectives
When beginning dealings with a new supplier, we review whether the supplier meets Canon’s standards in such areas as financial position, management system (quality/cost/delivery date/manufacturing capacity), corporate ethics (legal compliance, product safety, management of confidential information, human rights, labor, occupational health and safety, and intellectual property rights protection, etc.) and global environmental conservation. Only suppliers who meet these standards are registered on our supplier list, along with existing procurement partners.
With regard to “human rights and labor,” an area of high interest to stakeholders in recent years, survey items are set with reference to International Labor Organization (ILO) standards and the guidance of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), formerly known as the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC). We confirm whether appropriate consideration is given to such issues as child labor, forced labor that includes trafficking of persons, discrimination, minimum wage, working hours, and employee communication. In addition, in the environment field, we are pursuing green procurement of parts and materials for products from suppliers on the condition that they fulfill the Green Procurement Standards.
As part of Canon’s thorough approach to supply chain management, we conduct an annual survey of all companies registered on our supplier list. The survey covers a wide range of initiatives, including social and environmental aspects. We undertake a comprehensive evaluation of our suppliers based on the survey results and transaction performance, and reflect the results in the supplier list, giving preference to high-scoring suppliers. We also provide guidance and education to low-scoring suppliers to aid improvement.
In line with these efforts, requires that its suppliers ask the same of their upstream suppliers (tier two suppliers for Canon).
● Environmental-conservation activities
● Corporate ethics (legal compliance, product safety, management of confidential information, human rights, labor, occupational health and safety, and intellectual property rights protection, etc.)
holds “business trends briefings” for suppliers at each Inc. operational site and each Group production site, asking for their understanding of procurement policies and cooperation with business plans.
Through such communication, we aim to share information with suppliers, strengthen collaboration, and grow together.
Addressing the Issue of Conflict Minerals
Certain minerals—notably tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten—that originate in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries in Africa are used in many industrial products through global supply chains. Trade in some of these minerals is alleged to be funding armed groups in the and adjoining countries who are instigating grave abuses of human rights, environmental destruction, and illegal mining. They are termed “conflict minerals.”
In response, the United States enacted legislation requiring listed companies to confirm that conflict minerals that could fund these armed groups are not being used in their supply chains, and to provide related public disclosures. The legislation went into effect in January 2013.
Seeking to ensure that customers can use its products with peace of mind, is working together with business partners and industry groups with the aim of avoiding the use of conflict minerals that could fund armed groups. As a listed company, is required to submit a Conflict Minerals Report annually by the end of May with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) detailing the status of Group activities to address the issue of conflict minerals.
Due Diligence
identifies any products that could contain any of four minerals and conducts inquiries to its suppliers to trace the origin of the minerals back to its upstream supply chain regarding the parts and materials of the identified products. Then, undertakes due diligence to identify the risks of funding armed groups relating to conflict minerals.
The surveys utilize the Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT), an industry standard published by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI).
In fiscal 2017, sent CMRT-based surveys to roughly 3,000 suppliers with a response rate of about 90%.
Within the scope of the responses, there was nothing to clearly suggest that the Group’s purchasing of parts and materials contributed to funding armed groups. However, recognizing the innate difficulties involved in identifying smelters and country of origin of minerals or lacking clarity in many responses due to its complicated supply chain, is making efforts to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the inquiries.
Cooperation with Industry Groups
Since April 2015, has supported the activities of the RMI, an international program focused on addressing the issue of conflict minerals.
In Japan, as a member of the Responsible Minerals Trade Working Group (RMTWG) of the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA), supports activities of the briefings for firms in the electronics industry supply chain and sending letters to smelters urging them to accept audits. is also a member of the Conflict Free Sourcing Working Group (CFSWG), which cooperates with and leading Japanese automakers.
Independent Assurance Report
undergoes audits by independent private sector experts to gain independent assurance on whether the Group’s initiatives on conflict minerals sourcing conform with international standards. An independent assurance report is attached to the Conflict Minerals Report filed with the SEC.
Basic Approach of the Group Regarding Conflict Minerals (Excerpt)
Seeking to ensure that customers can use products with peace of mind, the Group is working together with business partners and industry entities to identify the history of minerals used in its products with the aim of avoiding the use of conflict minerals.
The Group would like our business partners to understand the international circumstances surrounding the conflict minerals issue and support us in not using conflict minerals. By cooperating with surveys and audits conducted by Group companies, we expect our business partners, as members of the global supply chain, to join the Group in carrying out the responsible procurement of necessary minerals.
Compliance with Modern Slavery Act
The Modern Slavery Act that was enacted in the in 2015 mandates enterprises operated in with a certain scale to publish annual statements detailing the risk of forced labor, human trafficking and child labor within their own operations and supply chain. Annual statements are published by Europe-based Group companies that fall within the scope of the law, based on the information on human rights risk assessments conducted by Group production sites and suppliers.
In compliance with this legislation, annual statements are also published by Medical Systems (CMSC) and Axis Communications.Creating New Value and Solving Social Issues Through Business Activities
Canon’s Approach to Intellectual Property
Since its establishment, has actively engaged in technology research and development, achieving solid growth as an R&D-oriented company in creating markets and customer segments by developing products with proprietary technologies.
This history underpins our belief that the achievements of R&activities are products and intellectual property (IP). At Canon, the purpose of activities is clearly defined as being to support business development. We aim to make a practical contribution to realizing technologies of benefit to society through the creation and utilization of assets based on the fruits of varied research, from basic patents related to essential core next-generation technologies to essential patents linked to common technologies that are vital for social infrastructure.
Basic Policy of Activities
● activities are vital to support business operations
● The fruits of R&are products and IP
● Intellectual property rights of other companies should be respected and handled appropriately.
takes a strict, consistent approach against counterfeit goods and intellectual property infringements. At the same time, we respect the intellectual property rights of other companies. We have established clear rules to ensure that our products do not infringe on rights held by others.
More specifically, we conduct thorough investigations of third-party patents to prevent use of intellectual property held by others without permission. Such thorough investigations of third-party rights occur at all stages, from R&onward, based on cooperation between the R&division involved in the technology and the department responsible for intellectual property rights.
By conducting thorough investigations of third-party patents, smoothly and appropriately enters into partnerships with other companies and external research institutions for cross-licensing or joint research projects. This enables to achieve greater results than it could attain by using only its own patents.
Group Intellectual Property Management System
To carry out Canon’s business activities consistent with its intellectual property strategy, intellectual property rights management has been centralized under the direction of the Corporate Intellectual Property and Legal Headquarters at Inc. We manage the Group’s intellectual property rights from the standpoint of optimizing the overall intellectual property portfolio.
For example, when concluding a patent licensing agreement with another company (a third party), the Corporate Intellectual Property and Legal Headquarters approves the agreement only after making adjustments reflecting merits for the entire Group. This step ensures that the Group maintains an appropriate intellectual property portfolio. We review our portfolio regularly to ensure that only necessary rights are being reserved.
As a Managing Executive Officer, the Group Executive of Inc.’s Corporate Intellectual Property and Legal Headquarters makes decisions regarding the use of intellectual property from a management perspective, and coordinates with other business divisions.
Intellectual Property Management System
Management to Strengthen Group Companies
The respective roles and responsibilities of Inc.’s Corporate Intellectual Property and Legal Headquarters and the intellectual property divisions at each Group company, along with the process for formulating policies on other shared activities and issues are determined by Canon’s management rules.
Moreover, persons in charge at the Corporate Intellectual Property and Legal Headquarters are assigned to or visit Group companies to improve global intellectual property activities and develop human resources.
In-house Intellectual Property Education
Inc. provides intellectual property training so its employees understand the importance of intellectual property and adhere to Canon’s intellectual property policies. This occurs at various stages: during training for new employees, during intellectual property training aimed at development, and during training for newly appointed managers and general managers.
Applying for Patents around the Globe
places importance on applying for patents on a global basis, and as of the end of 2017, had approximately 90,000 patents and utility models worldwide.
When filing patent applications outside Japan, our teams develop detailed patent-filing strategies based on regional business strategies, technologies and product trends to assess countries/regions where patents are required. We have focused on filing patent applications for the market due to its large scale and preponderance of high-tech companies. has ranked in the top five for patent registrations in each of the past 32 years. In 2017, we ranked third overall and were the patent leader among Japanese companies for the 13th consecutive year.

Working with Governments and Other Companies
Promoting Cooperation with Intellectual Property Policies
In order to strengthen international competitiveness through the use of intellectual property, the creation of a nationwide strategy for Japan is absolutely imperative. Having served in a variety of roles relating to intellectual property in Japan, has made various proposals to Japan Patent Office and other government agencies as a member of the Intellectual Property Committee of Japan Business Federation, Japan Intellectual Property Association and International Association for the Protection of Intellectual Property Japan (AIPPI·JAPAN).
Currently, the Group Executive of Inc.’s Corporate Intellectual Property and Legal Headquarters serves on the Evaluation, Planning and Verification Committee of the Japanese government’s Intellectual Property Strategy Headquarters. He is a member of the Subcommittee on Unfair Competition Prevention of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan’s Industrial Structure Council Intellectual Property Committee, and chairs AIPPI·He also actively lobbies for policy in Japan. The Group Executive also serves as the Chairman of the International Association for the Protection of Intellectual Property Japan.
In this capacity he is able to proactively exchange views with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and Commissioners of Patents in the United States, China, South Korea and Europe, enabling him to lobby for international policy.
Mitigating Patent Litigation Risk through Collaboration with Other Companies
In recent years, due to the sudden increase in the number of patents, there has been a sharp rise in patent lawsuits initiated by Patent Assertion Entities (PAEs). PAEs have no actual business operations and instead attempt to receive large settlements from operating companies. PAEs initiate more than half of the several thousand patent lawsuits filed annually in the United States.
In 2014, established the License on Transfer Network (Network) together with Google and other companies to curb lawsuits by PAEs.
When a Network member company transfers a patent to a PAE, the license for that patent is granted to other member companies without requiring any compensation. This reduces the risk of litigation from PAEs.
As of April 2018, 218 companies who own more than 1,000,000 patent assets belonged to the network.

Canon's Life Cycle Accessment
The protection and conservation of the global environment is one of the most important issues a corporation must address if it is to generate sustainable growth. With the goal of maximizing resource efficiency, we strive to increase operational efficiency and reduce environmental impact at Group operating sites worldwide.
We have consistently engaged in activities that aim to reduce the environmental impact of products over their entire life cycle, from green procurement—or the purchasing of more eco-friendly parts and materials—to the development of energy-saving product designs, recycling of factory wastewater and collection and recycling programs for used toner cartridges. As a comprehensive environmental indicator, we have set a goal of improving product lifecycle CO
 emissions by an average of 3% per year. Over the period from 2008 to 2017, we achieved an average annual improvement of approximately 5%. In 2017, we completed the Eco Technology Park in Japan, a symbol of our ongoing commitment to “product-to-product recycling.” In addition to its role as a base for environmental initiatives designed to maximize resource efficiency, it will also provide environmental education opportunities for visitors, including primary and secondary school students. Furthermore, under our Biodiversity Policy, we leverage the products and technical expertise has cultivated throughout its history to promote a society rich in biodiversity. As outlined in our Environmental Vision, we will continue our efforts to realize a society that promotes both enriched lifestyles and the global environment.
