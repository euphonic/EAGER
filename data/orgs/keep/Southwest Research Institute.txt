Thomas Baker Slick Jr. – an adventurer, philanthropist and oilman – founded Swon a South Texas ranch in 1947. After recruiting talent from across the nation, he challenged his team of scientists and engineers to seek revolutionary advancements through advanced science and applied technology. That spirit lives on today. Swendures as one of the oldest, independent nonprofit organizations in the United States, providing innovative science, technology, and engineering services to government and commercial clients around the world.
SwRI
Swbegan as a vision and developed into a reality beyond our founder’s wildest dreams. What started out as a small operation on a converted cattle ranch has grown to more than 2 million square feet of state-of-the-art laboratories, facilities, and offices.
SwRI’& TECHNOLOGY
1967-1987
1987-2007
Founder Tom Slick recruits Harold Vagtborg as the first president to lead scientists and engineers at a 1,200-acre cattle ranch outside San Antonio. Swgrows from 64 projects to 600 in the first five years, gaining national prominence for automotive testing, environmental research, and radio direction finding. Annual revenues reach $4.5 million by 1957. Martin Goland becomes president in 1959.
1967-1987
Swexpands its capabilities as a pioneer, setting standards in fields such as microencapsulation, space research, oil and gas, ocean engineering, nondestructive evaluation, emissions, and materials research. During the 1970s, Swdevelops new and safety standards for emissions, fire, and air pollution. The grows and expands in the 1980s into new areas including direction finding, aviation systems, automation, artificial intelligence, and manufacturing.
1987-2007
Dan Bates is named president in November 1997. By 2000, Swushers in its first major space mission, the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE), paving the way for more projects. Revenue reaches $270 million in 1997 and continues to grow during Bates’ tenure to $592 million in 2014, the same year Bates retires after serving 17 years as president. Swrapidly expands work on robotics, intelligent systems, machinery dynamics, intelligent transportation systems, and space science.
Adam Hamilton, P.E., becomes the Institute’s fourth president in 2014. He leads 2,602 scientists, engineers, and support staff members. Swgains worldwide attention by leading missions such as the New Horizons mission to Pluto, Juno mission to Jupiter, Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, and Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX). Swis also a leader in fuel and energy efficiency, geosciences, turbomachinery, automated driving systems, and energy storage.

Projects can enter our pharmaceutical development pipeline at various stages of maturity. Our seasoned staff will quickly assess and determine gaps or high risk points for Chemistry Manufacturing and Control (CMC) and regulatory strategy in order to best advise our client.
Our project managers have direct experience advancing drugs from concept through Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensure, setting up type 2 meetings, preparing meeting packages, and identifying strategic questions that could impact development and lifecycle management costs. We have experience developing nonclinical safety and efficacy studies that will answer key development questions and expedite review. We have experience writing, hyperlinking and submitting investigational new drugs (INDs) in electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD) format and submitting updates, even through phase 3 clinical studies.
Once under agreement, our project managers are empowered to execute the project, select specific staff with appropriate skills and authorize purchases to provide highly effective and efficient project teams to address our client’s requirements. The Swproject manager has access to a full collection of robust enterprise-wide tools.
We understand that communication with our clients is critical. As such, the project manager will conduct frequent project updates with involved staff and contractors and provide reports to our clients describing progress, near-term issues and performance against budget. Potential disruptions to the project schedule are discussed with the project team, and then forwarded to our clients with recommendations for resolution.
Cost and schedule are tracked and reported to the client to ensure the viability of the program and to provide all required deliverables within the limits of the contract. Swuses real-time accounting methods to track project budgets and project deliverables. We also use earned value management systems (EVMS) as part of our project management strategy. Using EVMS, the impact of minor changes in schedule can be quantified in real time so that the budget impact – not only on the program element, but on the entire program – can be known in real time. Thus, budget risk and schedule risk are known when decisions are made. Using this system, the threshold of deviation can be agreed to with the client at the onset of the program so that everyone has the same level of certainty regarding the progress of the program.
We use online deliverables tracking internally and for its subcontractors to help manage on-time performance. Our multi-functional, integrated systems for project management result in project goals that are routinely met with minimum risk.
Swis an FDA-registered drug establishment (1614272) that supplies pharmaceuticals and drug products made under current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) requirements. Swpersonnel can anticipate application requirements for all aspects of pharmaceutical development, so (where appropriate) data will be collected in anticipation of key elements and formats required for regulatory submission.
