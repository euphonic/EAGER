Our part in tackling global health challenges and our aim to extend the benefits of our products to more people
Our Vaccines business has a broad portfolio and innovative pipeline of vaccines to protect people of all ages. We deliver over two million vaccine doses per day to people living in over 160 countries.
The vaccines in our portfolio have been helping to protect people from serious disease for well over 100 years, with our Marietta (US) site dedicated to smallpox vaccine production since 1882.  Today, our vaccines continue to tackle some of the world’s most devastating diseases, including pneumococcal disease, meningitis, hepatitis, rotavirus, whooping cough and influenza.
Our Vaccines business has a portfolio of more than 40 vaccines for every stage of life, helping to protect people against 22 diseases. We have a pipeline of 14 candidate vaccines in development. One third of our vaccines in development target diseases particularly prevalent in the developing world, including all three infectious disease priorities: HIV, malaria and Our other vaccines in development include vaccines for the treatment of and prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). In October 2017, our shingles vaccine, Shingrix, received regulatory approval in Canada and the US.
The business generated sales of £5.2 billion in 2017, representing 17% of the total turnover of the Group.
Our marketplace 
Vaccination is recognised worldwide as one of the best investments that any government or healthcare organisation can make. In 2012, the and its 194 member’s states published an action plan on vaccination to extend access to immunization to everyone in the world, promote innovation in the vaccines industry and prevent millions of deaths.
This plan involves more equitable access to existing vaccines for people in all communities, the introduction of new and improved vaccines and accelerated research and development for the next generation of vaccines and technologies. Overall, this should translate into a growing global demand for vaccines over the next 10-15 years.
For example, more than 25 million children are born every year in India alone and it’s estimated that by 2020 there will be more than a billion people in the world aged over 60.
and Comic Relief: Joining forces to fight malaria.
Comic Relief and form a partnership to fight malaria 
Our strategy is to bring differentiated, high-quality, and needed vaccines to as many people as possible.
To do this we focus on creating a strong patient and payer focused pipeline, maintaining valuable partnerships with our local operating countries, and ensuring sustainable access and affordability. 
of our vaccines go to emerging markets
Malaria related illnesses and mortality estimated by to cost Africa's economy up to $12bn a year
Quality and manufacturing
In 2017, we sold more than 798 million doses of vaccine around the world. These are made in one of our 16 manufacturing sites located around the world. For some of our vaccines, this production process can take up to two years.
On average, each batch of vaccine will have undergone more than 100 quality checks before it is sent out, to ensure the vaccines meet world-class standards. Each of our vaccines is produced to the same quality standard, regardless of where in the world the vaccine will be used. 
We are continuously investing in our manufacturing facilities, improving our processes and building partnerships to ensure we meet the global growing needs for high quality vaccines.
Research and collaboration
Innovation is the beating heart of our business. Without it, there will be no new vaccines for the many diseases that still threaten individuals, families and communities around the world.
Our R&organisation brings together expertise in virology, bacterial infection and different adjuvant platforms.  We now have three global R&hubs: Rockville, (new in 2015); Rixensart, Belgium and Siena, Italy, which are focused on discovering and developing novel vaccines across a range of pressing public health threats. Our efforts are concentrated on those possible vaccines which may offer significant improvements over existing options or target diseases for which no vaccines yet exist. 
Our approach is to make the most of our own expertise and experience, while at the same time forming complementary partnerships and alliances with others who bring different kinds of expertise. Our vision for the world, where everyone has access to the vaccines they need, depends on a steady supply of great ideas and brilliant science. We have much to offer and through collaboration we can achieve so much more.
For example, more than 90% of the vaccines in our pipeline are being developed in partnership with others. We have a long track record of collaborating with governments, healthcare providers, regulators, academic institutions, non-governmental organisations, vaccine producers and other key partners to tackle public health challenges around the world.

Our part in tackling global health challenges and our aim to extend the benefits of our products to more people
Beginning in 1715 with the opening of an apothecary shop in London, our story has always focused on innovation. From a selection of individual entrepreneurs to a global company of around 100,000 employees, we’ve developed a variety of medicines and healthcare products that form the foundations of today’s GSK.
Innovative entrepreneurs: 1715 – 1891
The early history of GSK: how a range of entrepreneurs built the foundations of the we know today.
In this period, our legacy companies expanded globally, developing and selling new products worldwide.
An era of landmark scientific breakthroughs, building brand portfolios and product consolidation.
Creating the of today: 1950 – 1999
An exciting period of discovery: we developed the first treatment for HIV, enhanced our consumer brands and developed new treatments for asthma.
With our three global businesses of Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare, we aim to bring differentiated, high-quality and needed healthcare products to as many people as possible.

Our part in tackling global health challenges and our aim to extend the benefits of our products to more people
On 25 July 2018 we announced our new approach to R&focusing on science related to the immune system, the use of genetics and investments in advanced technologies.
Our Pharmaceuticals business has a broad portfolio of innovative and established medicines. We currently focus on developing new medicines in respiratory and HIV/infectious diseases, oncology and immuno-inflammation; with discovery research exploring these and other areas.
The business generated sales of £17.3 billion in 2017, representing 57% of the total turnover of the Group.
The business is made up of innovative and established medicines and holds leading market positions in respiratory disease and In our Pharmaceuticals R&organisation, almost 80% of research spending focuses on two current therapy areas: respiratory and HIV/infectious diseases; and two potential areas: oncology and immuno-inflammation.
Our marketplace
The global pharmaceuticals market is vast. The remains a priority market for growth with other key growth areas including emerging markets and Asia Pacific regions. 
This trend of increasing demand is expected to continue as the world’s population grows, economies in the emerging markets become more prosperous and global changes in lifestyles affect long-term health.
Janet Liberty, an patient
Our strategy is to research and produce innovative, high-quality and needed medicines; making these as accessible as possible to countries at all levels of income and development. 
To do this we focus on creating a strong differentiated pipeline, leading in and respiratory, and developing our presence in speciality therapy areas, including oncology and immuno-inflammation. 
Our Pharmaceuticals portfolio
Our portfolio is made up of innovative and established medicines and we have leading global positions in respiratory disease and HIV.
We have been a leader in respiratory disease for over 40 years and have a portfolio of mature products. In recent years, we have strengthened and broadened our respiratory portfolio with the addition of new medicines including an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) combination, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and dual bronchodilator.
Our business is managed through ViiHealthcare, a global specialist company in that we majority own, with Pfizer and Shionogi as shareholders. ViiHealthcare is now a leading global company in and has had significant recent success with regulatory approval and industry leading launches of new medicines. ViiHealthcare has a number of other antiretroviral medicines in clinical development.
In addition to respiratory and HIV, we have a portfolio of other innovative pharmaceutical products for the treatment of conditions such as lupus, urology and anti-infectives.  
We also have an Established Products Portfolio (EPP) which includes mature medicines in the areas of anti-infectives, allergy, central nervous system, dermatology, respiratory and urology. These products are an important part of our Emerging Markets business where the brand is an important differentiator.
The journey to discovering and developing new medicines is lengthy, expensive and subject to a high rate of failure. Learn more about 
how we discover new medicines
We are exploring different approaches to promote – and speed up – innovation in our labs.  Having broken down the traditional, R&model, our scientists now work in smaller units focused on specific areas of research. This encourages greater entrepreneurialism and accountability. These groups are tasked with seeking out the biological targets involved in disease and creating molecules or biopharmaceuticals that will ultimately become new medicines. 
We also know that we won’t discover everything inside our own labs and that we need to partner with other companies, academic institutions and research charities.  We currently have research collaborations with more than 1,500 external organisations.
We also recognise our responsibility to meet society’s expectations to invest in disease areas where the science is difficult or where the typical business model to reward innovation may not be relevant; one example being our 
. We are also one of the few healthcare companies researching the World Health Organization’s three priority diseases - HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.
Other business areas
Our Vaccines business has a broad portfolio and innovative pipeline of vaccines to protect people of all ages. We deliver over two million vaccine doses per day to people living in over 160 countries.
Consumer Healthcare
Our Consumer Healthcare business develops and markets consumer preferred and expert recommended brands in the Oral health, Pain relief, Respiratory, Nutrition/gastro-intestinal and Skin health categories.

Improving health, safety and resilience
Our health and safety programmes enable employees to lead healthier, safer lives at work and home
Diversity and a culture of inclusion fuel our mission to help people do more, feel better, live longer 
We do not think about inclusion and diversity as a project to be managed, an initiative or an awareness campaign. One of our core values is 
 and we aim to put inclusion and diversity at the heart of everything we do. By creating an environment where everyone’s voice is heard and each person is able to achieve their full potential, we believe we will perform better as a company.
Maintaining an inclusive environment, which reflects the diversity of the patients and customers we serve, takes focus. We are determined to fully unlock the potential available to us from the different knowledge, perspectives, experiences and working styles across our global population. Specialist development programmes for high-potential diverse talent, senior leader sponsorship for inclusion and diversity, and positive change championed by our numerous employee resource groups are just some of ways we are committed to realising this potential.

Consumer Healthcare
Consumer Healthcare
Our Consumer Healthcare business develops and markets consumer preferred and expert recommended brands in the Oral health, Pain relief, Respiratory, Nutrition/gastro-intestinal and Skin health categories.
We are one of the world’s leading over-the-counter healthcare companies. We hold number one positions in Wellness across 36 markets, and are market leaders in specialist oral care.
We have a portfolio of loved and trusted brands that are underpinned by science including: 
Sensodyne, Parodontax, Poligrip
Otrivin
The business generated sales of £7.8 billion in 2017, representing 26% of the total turnover of the Group.
On 19 December 2018 we announced our agreement with Pfizer to form a new world-leading Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture. Within 3 years of the closing of the transaction, we intend to separate the Joint Venture via a demerger. With our future intention to separate, the transaction also presents a clear pathway forward for us to create a new global Pharmaceuticals/Vaccines company, and a new world-leading Consumer Healthcare company. 
Our marketplace
Today, people are taking an increasingly active role in managing their own health. This is being fuelled by an emerging global middle class, rising healthcare costs and ageing populations. Demand for consumer healthcare products is growing, particularly in emerging markets where consumers are seeking more affordable and accessible products.
Consumer healthcare products are dependent on brand loyalty and trademark protection.  Some of our heritage brands such as
are more than 140 years old but continue to be popular today.
Our strategy is to meet the everyday healthcare needs of our consumers through building consumer preferred and expert recommended brands.
To do this we focus on excellence in innovation to develop world class brands, and on building our reputation through best in class interactions with retailers, healthcare professionals and shoppers.
Research for product innovation
Our business is built on science and this research heritage contributes to the development of our Consumer Healthcare products, giving us a unique advantage over our competition. 
Today, we are using science to speed up the time to develop new product innovations, make them more accessible to the people who need them, and to develop benefits our consumers value, ultimately growing our business.
At the same time, we continue to ensure we meet all regulatory requirements for testing, approval, manufacturing, labelling and marketing of our products.

Jaya was born with a complete unilateral cleft lip and palate. Her parents, Arun and Sudha knew nothing about this condition. local doctor drew a picture and explained to them what cleft is.
It was when her parents took Jaya to see Dr. Dhatchayini, a paediatrician in a private hospital for cleft treatment that they learned about Smile Train’s work and free cleft surgeries at Sri Ramachandra Hospital in Chennai. Jaya was three months old when she had her first surgery.
The transformation has been extraordinary. Jaya’s thriving and her next cleft palate surgery will be when she is nine months old. We’ll be there to check in on her progress and learn how she is getting on later this year.
What is cleft lip and palate?
Image courtesy of Smile Train
One of the most common facial birth defects, it is a split in the upper lip and/or roof of the mouth (palate). Causes are unknown, although it can run in families.
Cleft surgery can cost from as little as $250, but if left untreated, children can often struggle to eat, breathe and speak properly, which can leave them isolated from communities and with on-going health issues.
In the developed world it is almost entirely corrected within the first 6 months of life, meaning the condition has relatively low visibility and awareness.
Smile Train provide 100% free comprehensive care for cleft patients. This can range from a nutritional programme to ensure the child is physically fit for surgery (since many cleft patients will be malnourished) to orthodontic care and speech therapy post-surgery where available.
Smile Train work only with a sustainable model where local doctors receive additional training and support from Smile Train and then carry out surgeries utilising local facilities.
Smile Train provide funding for equipment and financial aid, so their partners can provide free cleft surgery and care.

Working with Comic Relief to fight malaria
five-year partnership focused on strengthening local health systems. We are working together with communities to support their efforts to fight malaria.
The race against malaria: handing the baton to the next generation
How one mother in Tanzania is helping to protect her family from malaria
Over the past 15 years, significant progress has been made against malaria. The 
World Malaria Report
 shows that deaths have more than halved since 2000, but it also shows that after an unprecedented period of success in global malaria control, progress has stalled and can be easily reversed, not in a few years, but during the next rainy season.
Malaria continues to claim nearly half a million lives every year, most of them very young children in Africa. This preventable and treatable disease continues to take a heavy human and economic toll.
216,000,000
In 2016 alone, 91 countries reported a total of 216 million cases of malaria, over five million cases more than the previous year. Globally, malaria deaths reached 445,000 deaths, about the same as the number reported in 2015.
Created by a £17 million donation from and £5 million from Comic Relief.
Johari Msubaha (right), the Secretary of the Kanyabeza womens’s group and Tabu Hamisi Kihuna (left), the leader of the group.
Together with Comic Relief, we aim to make a real difference to those living in five malaria endemic countries. Comic Relief and believe that one of the best ways to fight malaria is to work with communities to help strengthen local and national health services and improve their ability to combat the disease.
Once malaria's spread is controlled, its devastating impact will be diminished. This, in turn, can lead to better overall health for people living in poverty and whole communities will have the chance to thrive.
Both and Comic Relief believe that defeating malaria will unlock human and economic potential. it will give children a chance to grow up healthy, and health workers the chance to focus their resources on other challenges. malaria free future is worth fighting for.

Pension Schemes Statements of Investment Principles (SIP)
The links below will allow you to download the Statements of Investment Principles for the main pension schemes.
The contents of these documents are set out under law and cover the investment policies of the schemes in the following broad areas:  Risk Measurement and Management, Implementation and Governance. The documents also provide details of the asset allocation of the investments.
The Statements have been agreed by the Trustee Boards on the basis of written advice from their appointed external investment advisers and lawyers.  There is a consultation process on the with the participating employers as required by law.
The Statements are reviewed by the Trustees annually and also if there are any significant changes to the investment policies.
The Trustees monitor compliance with this statement at least annually.  Fund manager activity is reviewed quarterly through reports prepared by investment consultants. Additionally, meetings are held with fund managers at least annually to review the activities and compliance with their contractual terms and with the Statements of Investment Principles.

Pension Plan SIP
Socially Responsible Investing (SRI) is most commonly understood to mean investing in a manner that takes into account the impact of investments on wider society and the natural environment, both today and in the future. The Trustee of the Pension Plans annually reviews its policies as part of the Trustee business planning process, and the Pension Plans publish ‘Statements of Investment Principles’ which provide a high level overview of the policies.
The Trustee aims to be an engaged and responsible long-term investor in the assets and markets in which it invests. The Trustee believes that the integration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors within investment managers’ investment processes is not detrimental to the risk and the sustainable long-term expected returns from pension schemes’ investments.
The Trustee does not wish to interfere with the day to day investment decisions of its investment managers. However, the Trustee does encourage its investment managers to comply with the principles outlined in the Principles for Responsible Investment and the Stewardship Code where this is appropriate for their mandate, as well as to take into account considerations in the selection, retention and realisation of investments in so far as this is consistent with their overall objectives.  
The Trustee regularly reviews the voting strategy of its investment managers. The Trustee also supports the principle of shareholder activism and, for relevant mandates, prefers its investment managers to have an explicit strategy, outlining the circumstances in which they will engage with a company on matters and how they will measure the effectiveness of this strategy.
For Pension Plans, the majority of the assets are managed by Legal and General Investment Management (LGIM). In particular, a portion of the Plans’ equity portfolio follows a low carbon investment philosophy by re-weighting away from carbon intensive assets. Companies with significant carbon emissions as well as those with large fossil fuel reserves are underweighted which, in turn, reduces the Plans’ carbon footprint as well as stranded asset risk. Overall, the mandate’s carbon footprint is around three-quarters lower than that of the parent index (World). Additionally, complies with the principles set out in the Stewardship Code and are also a signatory to the Principles for Responsible Investment. In addition, maintain a large, dedicated team which is responsible for monitoring and which is actively engaged in encouraging companies to improve their standards.
detailed review of LGIM’s activities, including examples of LGIM’s engagement activities with companies, can be found in the Corporate Governance Report below.

How we’re working with Save the Children to save one million children’s lives
More than 6 million children are dying every year, most from preventable diseases. We’re working together with Save the Children to change that.
Our pioneering and powerful partnership with Save the Children has now been extended to 2022.  We continue to work together combining GSK’s scientific and manufacturing expertise with Save the Children’s on-the-ground experience to find new ways to help bring down the number of children dying from preventable and treatable diseases.
Mouthwash to medicine
Find out how our scientists have adapted an ingredient from a mouthwash into a potentially life-saving gel for newborns in developing countries, in partnership with Save the Children.
Almost 6 million children under the age of five die every year from preventable causes. Since 2000, significant progress has been made globally to reduce the rate of child deaths, however more needs to be done to prevent children dying unnecessarily.

In 2013 we embarked on an ambitious global partnership with Save the Children that is combining the two organisations’ global expertise, skills and energy to tackle the ambitious goal of helping to save one million children’s lives. Together we are finding new ways to help reduce child mortality.
children under 5 died in 2015 from preventable diseases
The partnership goes well beyond the traditional charity corporate fundraising model. We are combining our capabilities in R&D, supply chain, procurement and vaccines with Save the Children’s expertise working with the most vulnerable children.
Specifically, the and Save the Children partnership focuses on:
improving access to basic healthcare – prevention and treatment – where the need is greatest
training and equipping health workers in the poorest communities
developing child-friendly medicines
working at local and global levels to call for stronger child health policies
Since launching our partnership, we have reached over 2.6 million children. Over 86,500 under-fives have been fully immunised, over 183,000 children have been treated for diarrhoea, malaria or pneumonia, and over one million children have been screened for malnutrition.

Suriya is from the country’s capital, Kinshasa, where 7 million of the city’s 10 million inhabitants are thought not to be vaccinated. Immunisation is one of the most successful and cost-effective health interventions. It can help give every child a chance of survival.
Between 1990 and 2015 improvements in immunisation coverage contributed to an over 50% drop in child deaths globally. However, 18.7 million children worldwide still miss out. So, as well as supporting emergency vaccination programmes like this one in DRC, the and Save the Children partnership is using its joint voice to call for vaccines for every last child.

Prize recognises innovations that are helping reduce child deaths
This year’s Healthcare Innovation Award gives special attention to innovations which focus on the hardest-to-reach children
and Save the Children today launched their fourth annual $1 million Healthcare Innovation Award, which rewards innovations in healthcare that help to reduce child deaths in developing countries and have the potential to reach even more children.
From the 7 July – 7 September 2016, organisations from across developing countries can nominate innovative healthcare approaches they have implemented. These innovations must have resulted in tangible improvements to under-5 child survival, be sustainable and have the scope to be scaled-up and replicated.
The Award is one of a number of initiatives from and Save the Children’s five-year strategic partnership, which combines the two organisations’ expertise and skills with the aim to help save one million children’s lives. Since 2013, more than a dozen inventive approaches – from a paperless immunisation records system to an affordable diarrhoea treatment kit – have been recognised through the Award. This year, as well as recognising approaches that have helped reduce child deaths, the Award will give special attention to innovations that focus on the hardest-to-reach children.
Outlining the focus of this year’s Award, Ali Forder, Director of Programme, Policy and Quality at Save the Children, said: “Extraordinary progress has been made in recent years to reduce the number of children dying before their fifth birthday. Despite this progress, more than five million children still die each year and millions of children are being left behind because of their gender, poverty, or ethnic identity; because they live in remote areas or urban slums; or because they are caught up in conflicts. We want to seek out and recognise ways in which these children can be reached.”
Lisa Bonadonna, head of the and Save the Children partnership, added: “When it comes to reaching the poorest children with quality healthcare, no single organisation has all the answers. So we’re always searching for new and different ideas, wherever they might be. Our Award recognises that some of the best solutions to development challenges come from people living with them. Tough conditions can stimulate innovation, generating solutions that are relevant and adaptable. If these bright ideas can be shared across countries and continents, the impact could be profound.”
In 2013, a device that eases the breathing of babies in respiratory distress was awarded the highest share of the Healthcare Innovation Award prize fund. It was developed by the College of Medicine/Friends of Sick Children, Malawi and Rice 360°: Institute for Global Health Technologies. Commenting on the impact of the Award, Professor Elizabeth Molyneux, professor of paediatrics at the College of Medicine and Queen Elizabeth Central Teaching Hospital, Blantyre, Malawi, said: “It was exciting to win the Award, which has allowed us to provide technology and training in teaching hospitals in Tanzania, Zambia and South Africa. Funding from and others shows confidence in what we are offering and gives us a chance to share with people who will benefit from it.”
judging panel, made up of experts from the fields of public health, science and academia, will award all or part of the funds to one or more of the best healthcare innovations. Further details on the judging process and criteria can be found online at www.healthcareinnovationaward.org
Entries close on 7 September 2016 at 11:59pm (GMT). Winners are expected to be announced in December.
About the Healthcare Innovation Award:
The Healthcare Innovation Award was announced following the launch of and Save the Children’s innovative partnership in May 2013, which is tackling the ambitious goal of helping save the lives of one million children in some of the world’s most vulnerable communities. One of the unique aspects of this shared value partnership is the focus on working together to maximise innovations to tackle under-5 child mortality. For example, Save the Children has a seat on a paediatric R&board, which includes representation from other independent experts as well as The board provides insight and research on child health that shapes GSK’s R&efforts through the partnership.
While good progress has been made in recent years, in 2015, more than 5 million children died before their fifth birthday1. Often these children are in the most remote and marginalised communities. The and Save the Children Healthcare Innovation Award aims to discover and encourage replication of the best and most innovative examples of healthcare to have the biggest impact for vulnerable children. 
The top prize in 2015’s Healthcare Innovation Award was granted to in Vietnam for Immreg, a system which brings immunisation records into the digital age. Rather than handwriting records, which can be time-consuming and prone to error, health workers in the Ben Tre province now use a computer or smart phone to monitor vaccine stocks; register pregnant women and newborns; and track what vaccines they have received. They can also remind mothers via text message to get vaccinations for them or their child. was awarded $400,000 to take forward their work. They plan to expand Immreg to an additional province in Vietnam and also adapt the system to tackle child malnutrition.
Previous winners of the Healthcare Innovation Award have gone on to expand and replicate their approach. Some examples include:
In 2013, a device that eases the breathing of babies in respiratory distress won the top award. It was developed by the College of Medicine/Friends of Sick Children, Malawi and Rice 360°: Institute for Global Health. They are rolling out the technology and providing training in teaching hospitals across Tanzania, Zambia and South Africa. Needs assessment, training and installation have been undertaken in all three countries; 14 hospitals have received units and continue to receive follow-up support from the project.
The mobile health management system, ZiDi– operated by MicroClinic Technologies, Kenya – was recognised in 2013 for its ability to improve the quality of maternal and child care by providing access to real-time data on medicines and disease trends, to support health planning decisions. According to MicroClinic Technologies, support from the Award has helped more than 500,000 patients to experience improved care through the facilities that are on ZiDi.
In 2014, Living Goods was recognised for their work in Uganda. The organisation trains and empowers skilled health micro-entrepreneurs who go door-to-door educating their community about ways to improve their health and distributing products such as fortified foods and solar lights. In 2015, Living Goods and its partner grew from 1,000 to 3,700 community health promoters in Uganda, more than tripling the number of families served.

2)   Describe an innovative approach or process applied to under-5 child survival that can demonstrate impact within an eligible country.
Winners of the 2015 Award:
As well as recognising innovations that help reduce child deaths, the third award adopted a special focus on strengthening health systems. Selected from more than 100 entries in 26 countries by a judging panel comprising health experts from across the globe, the winners were:
PATH, Vietnam - $400,000
Awarded for Immreg, a system which brings immunisation records into the digital age in Vietnam. Rather than handwriting records, which can be time-consuming and prone to error, health workers in the Ben Tre province now use a computer or smart phone to monitor vaccine stocks; register pregnant women and newborns; and track what vaccines they have received. They can also remind mothers via text message to get vaccinations for them or their child. This is saving health workers’ valuable time and improving access to vaccination. Immreg has cut the time to generate monthly lists of children due for vaccination from one to two days to just 5-30 minutes. Rates of full immunisation in the first year of life increased from 74.3 to 77.8% in a one-year pilot.
Awarded for their innovative use of the ‘Pratt Pouch’. This foil pouch – similar to a fast-food ketchup sachet – offers a more accurate and efficient way for mothers to give medicines to a newborn. One of the ways to reduce the risk of transmission from mother to child is through the administration of antiretroviral medicines to a newborn immediately after birth and for the first weeks of life.[1] But it can be difficult for parents to measure out the correct dose from a bottle of liquid medicine. Early results indicate that the Pratt Pouch – which is filled with the exact amount of medicine needed per dose – has improved dosing accuracy from 50% to over 90% of mothers delivering highly accurate doses. Mothers surveyed indicated that they found it simple to use, more durable and less wasteful.
2020 MicroClinic Initiative, Kenya - $176,600
Awarded for Operation Karibu, a ‘welcome programme’ of care for new mothers. The first 48 hours of life is the most crucial period for newborn survival[2] so access to healthcare is important at this time. ‘OpK’ has identified three ways to encourage pregnant women to seek medical care before, during and after birth. Women who give birth in the clinic, attended by a skilled professional, are given a set of baby clothes, including onesies made from recycled cotton t-shirts; emergency transport to the clinic is made available; and a birth companion of the woman’s choice is offered training in caring for an infant. Mothers and newborns are monitored via electronic case management for the first 30 days. Over the three-year programme, no maternal or neonatal deaths have been recorded in any of the Opsites.
Maternal and Infant Health Care, South Africa - $176,600
Awarded for ‘Child PIP’, an audit tool for careful review of infant and child deaths in South African hospitals. The primary aim is to enable local healthcare teams to understand the causes of child mortality in their area, in order to improve quality of care. The system allows for all deaths to be identified and for important information to be collected. This includes details on the child’s health and the main cause or causes of death. By identifying previously unseen patterns and ways in which healthcare processes could be changed, the tool has been used to help individual hospitals and the healthcare system as a whole to adapt and improve care for children. Child is now used by healthcare teams in more than half of public hospitals and in all of the country’s nine provinces. Next steps for Child include strengthening the programme and extending it to collect information about deaths in the community.
The following organisations from Africa, Asia and Latin America won a share of the 2014 Award:
University of KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa - $370,000
The University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) received one of the top prizes for its ground-breaking, low-cost system, called ‘FoneAstra’, which enables the safe pasteurisation and storage of donated human breast milk for premature babies. The FoneAstra human milk pasteurisation toolkit, originally developed by the University of KwaZulu-Natal in collaboration with health and the University of Washington, uses a mobile phone app to provide a step-by-step guide through the pasteurisation process and makes it easier to track and trace donor milk for increased quality control and assurance. It can be adapted for use in settings with no electricity. Up to 25% of premature or low birthweight babies cannot get sufficient breast milk from their mothers, often for reasons of illness or low supply, which leaves them more vulnerable to life threatening conditions such as diarrhoea, pneumonia and neonatal sepsis.
Joint first prize winner, ColaLife Zambia, won its share of the Award for its innovative ‘Kit Yamoyo’ (‘Kit of Life’), which brings affordable diarrhoea treatment to families in remote rural areas using the supply and distribution networks normally used to transport soft drinks. Diarrhoea is one of the world’s biggest killers of children under five. It can be simply treated using oral rehydration salts (ORS) and Zinc, yet less than 1% of children in sub-Saharan Africa receive the treatment.
ColaLife’s low-cost treatment kit contains 200ml sachets of ORS, a container to measure the correct amount of water, 10 zinc tablets and soap. It is promoted through rural health centres by community health workers and delivered by trained local village-based micro-retailers. Retailers travel to the nearest district town to buy the kits the same way they do for other fast moving consumer goods such as Coca-Cola, cooking oil, salt and sugar.
Living Goods, Uganda - $120,000
Living Goods’ entrepreneurial model mirrors direct sales techniques used by cosmetics firms like ‘Avon’. Skilled micro-entrepreneurs known as Community Health Promoters, who work closely with local health authorities, operate as franchisees. The health promoters travel door-to-door teaching families how to improve their health, and diagnosing and treating patients. They also sell health products such as bed nets, deworming pills, anti-malaria and diarrhoea treatments, fortified foods, and water filters.
University of Nairobi, Kenya - $120,000
This community health initiative was rewarded for its innovative bar-coded Vaccination/Mother-Child Wellness Card that tracks vaccinations and rewards mothers with discounts on farm products. Child immunisation is seen as a critical measure to reduce death rates in children under five which currently stand at 71 per 1,000 live births in Kenya [1] .The vaccination card automatically updates when a newborn is registered and each time the child and/or mother receives a vaccine.  It then allows the mother discounts on farm products, such as seeds and fertilizer, from Agrovets shops run by the University’s partner agency.
The following organisations from Africa, Asia and Latin America won a share of the 2013 Award:
Friends of Sick Children, Malawi - $400,000
Friends of Sick Children is a partnership between the Paediatric Department at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Blantyre, Malawi, Rice University's ’s Rice 360°: Institute for Global Health Technologies in the United States, and University of Malawi College of Medicine. Their ‘baby bubble’ – or Continuous Positive Airway Pressure device (bCPAP) - is a low-cost adaptation of a device proven to help newborn babies in respiratory distress, designed specifically for low-resource settings.
BRAC’s ‘Manoshi’ programme delivers a comprehensive package of health services for women and children in the urban slums of Dhaka and consists of three key innovations: safe, clean delivery centres in slum areas, access to emergency health care, home visits by health workers who record vital patient information.
MUSO, Mali, implements a system designed to support the early identification of women and children in need of healthcare, before their symptoms escalate to a more serious condition. The system includes door-to-door health visits by community health workers, training and education programmes for local leaders and communities
Microclinic Technologies’  ‘ZiDi’ is a mobile health management system designed to improve the quality of maternal and child care by providing access to real-time data to improve health-planning decisions. ZiDi is currently being used in over 5,000 health facilities in Kenya.
Kangaroo Foundation (Fundacion Canguro), Colombia - $100,000
Kangaroo Mother Care is a simple technique which promotes early skin-to-skin contact between mothers and their premature and newborn babies. Mothers act as human incubators, keeping their babies warm and regulating their heartbeats.

Trek for Kids, saving one million children lives
In March 2017, 40 employees from 24 countries around the world took part in Trek for Kids, climbing Mount Kenya and raising over £273,000 for Save the Children.
donated to Save the Children thanks to Trek for Kids
The trekkers exceeded their joint fundraising target through a variety of activities from cake sales to sponsored runs. The total raised will also be matched by GSK, meaning that Save the Children will receive a total of £546,000 as a direct result of the efforts of the trekkers and their supporters. The money will be used to support programmes throughout and Save the Children’s global partnership.
During their time in Kenya, the trekkers visited Bungoma County, in the north west of the country. They learnt more about the programme being delivered by Save the Children, through GSK’s support, and how it is helping to reduce maternal and newborn mortality by increasing access to quality health systems and services.
Volunteers and a baby
The partnership is already delivering measurable results. By December 2016 the global partnership had directly reached over 2.6 million children through a number of interventions such as researching and developing innovative child-friendly medicines, widening vaccination coverage in the hardest-to-reach communities, increasing investment in the training, reach and scope of health workers and helping children affected by disasters or humanitarian crisis.

Who the partnership is supporting
Anglican Diocesan Development and Relief Organisation (ADDRO):
This project seeks to promote community-based access to health services to reduce malaria burden on target groups, specifically pregnant women, and children under five in hard to reach, rural communities.
With a rights-based approach on strengthening community advocacy activities, on gender issues, and on establishing a child protection and safeguarding policy, hopes to see an increased number of people using malaria preventive measures, and those with malaria demanding and accessing appropriate services.
Women and children come to Zahanatiya Mahembe-Health Centre. The process includes being weighed, having a consultancy with a health care worker and if needed being tested and treated for malaria.
Alliance for Reproductive Health Rights (ARHR)
Using a Community Scorecard to generate data which communities can use to demand better malaria services, the project aims to:
catalyse health seeking behaviours
increase access to quality care for pregnant women and children under five.
Indepth Network
Through implementation research on approaches to reducing malaria in children under 10 years and pregnant women, this project will identify and test ways to:
increase access to malaria treatment in communities
improve knowledge of community level malaria care providers
enhance community demand for malaria services

Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002
Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002
Find out how conforms with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002.
Following a number of corporate and accounting scandals in the USA, Congress passed the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 (Sarbanes-Oxley). Sarbanes-Oxley established new standards for corporate accountability in the Although our corporate governance structure was believed to be robust and in line with best practice, certain changes were necessary to ensure compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley.
The Sarbanes-Oxley code of ethics
Sarbanes-Oxley requires to have a code of ethics "applicable to its Principal financial officer and controller or Principal accounting officer, or persons performing similar functions".
The code is defined as having standards that promote:
honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of interest between personal and professional relationships      
full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in the periodic reports required to be filed by the issuer
compliance with applicable governmental rules and regulations
formulated a Sarbanes-Oxley code of ethics around seven policies:
Company assets and proprietary information
External communications to investors and media; external speaking engagements and publications
Preventing corrupt practices and maintaining standards of documentation
Risk management and legal compliance
Our code of ethics goes beyond the requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley, in that it is applicable to all employees. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have both signed statements certifying their compliance with the code of ethics, as have the Senior Vice President, Financial Controller and the Senior Vice President, Finance Services.

Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires GSK's Annual Report on 20-filed with the Security and Exchange Commission to contain a report on internal controls.
This report must acknowledge that it is management's responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and include an assessment of the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. Management's evaluation is subject to audit by GSK's external auditors.
Financial expert
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley) requires that GSK's Annual Report contains a statement as to whether a member of the company's Audit & Risk Committee is an “Audit Committee Financial Expert” as defined by Sarbanes-Oxley.
consistent approach is taken by the Board in respect of this requirement and a similar requirement in the Corporate Governance Code for a member of the Audit & Risk Committee to have “recent and relevant financial experience”.
The Board has determined that Judy Lewent, Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee has the appropriate qualifications and background to be an Audit Committee Financial Expert and also has recent and relevant financial experience.
As recommended by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), established a Disclosure Committee (the Committee).
The Committee reports to the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Finance Officer and to the Audit & Risk Committee. It is chaired by the Company Secretary and the members consist of senior managers from finance, legal, compliance, corporate communications
internal experts are also invited to attend the Committee's meetings periodically.
The committee has responsibility for considering the materiality of information and on a timely basis, determining the disclosure and treatment of material information. The Committee also has responsibility for the timely filing of reports with the and the formal review of the contents of GSK's Annual Report and Form 20-F.
Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires to carry out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of the Group's management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Group's disclosure controls and procedures as at the year-end.
The results of this latest evaluation are included in our 
There were significant changes to the system of internal control during 2010 as a result of the Simplify Finance Change Programmes (CBS, Simplify Finance, ERP).  
These changes were captured and assessed by management and our external auditors, to ensure that there was no adverse impact to the Group's internal control over financial reporting.
At we are committed to operating at the highest standards of corporate governance. We believe our governance structure underpins our ability to deliver the Group's strategy to create long-term value and benefit for our shareholders and stakeholders.

Our part in tackling global health challenges and our aim to extend the benefits of our products to more people
While the first wireless signals were sent across the Atlantic and railways developed for commercial and then wartime use, our legacy companies were expanding across the world, developing and selling new products on an increasingly global scale.
Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories at Brockwell Park, Kent, UK, c.1910s
Manufacturing Beecham’s Pills
Demand for Beecham’s Pills increased in the 1880s and the Beecham’s factory expanded with new, better pill manufacturing machines installed.
By 1900, production of Beecham’s Pills had reached one million pills a day. By placing local language advertisements in newspapers around the world, Beecham began to reach a global consumer audience.
Pioneering modern pharmaceutical research
In 1894, the Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories, which focused on biological experimentation, especially early forms of vaccines, were established. Within a decade, Tropical Research Labs to study tropical illnesses were founded in Sudan, and a floating mobile lab with pathology services was established on the White Nile. These research institutions form the foundation of our R&operations today.
By the 1910s, Burroughs Wellcome had established a global presence; the New York office was the largest and most profitable international subsidiary.
Over 6 million boxes of Beecham’s Pills sold annually 
Wellcome Physiological Research Labs established in Kent, UK
Burroughs Wellcome & Co. (USA) established in New York 
Defiance dried milk factory, Bunnythorpe, New Zealand, c.1904
The origins of “Glaxo” 
Joseph Nathan & Co.’s dairy farms in New Zealand sold a freeze-dried milk powder, which by 1904, was manufactured under the name "Defiance". They tried to change the name to “Lacto” in 1906, but when this was denied by the Trademark Office, they chose the name “Glaxo”, which was registered later that year.
The iconic “Glaxo builds bonnie babies” advertising campaign began in 1908. Their dried milk was regarded as safer than fresh non-pasteurised milk, so its demand as a food for infants and children increased.
Joseph Nathan & Co. was bought out by its subsidiary Glaxo Laboratories Ltd. in 1947.
Aerial photo of Horlicks factory, Slough, UK, c.1910
Expanding across countries
In 1905, work began on a new Horlicks manufacturing site in the UK, to export the product to Europe and the
Empire. This was operational by 1908 and produced Horlicks for over a century.
In 1910, Stiefel’s grandson, August, began selling his family’s soaps in the US, where he registered the company as Stiefel Medicinal Soap Co. During this era, the company sold over 100 different products in countries around the world.

Exploring the world
Our legacy companies supported a wave of exploration expeditions in the early twentieth century. Burroughs Wellcome & Co.’s Tabloid medicine chests, which were filled with first aid and pharmaceutical supplies, accompanied the first transatlantic air crossing, and expeditions to the Amazon, Antarctic and Mount Everest.
By World War I, Horlicks had gained popularity among adult consumers, and was used as rations for soldiers and explorers. Famed explorer Admiral Richard Byrd even named the Horlick Mountains in Antarctica after the drink.
An era of landmark scientific breakthroughs, building brand portfolios and product consolidation.
Creating the of today: 1950 – 1999
An exciting period of discovery: we developed the first treatment for HIV, enhanced our consumer brands and developed new treatments for asthma.
With our three global businesses of Pharmaceuticals, Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare, we aim to bring differentiated, high-quality and needed healthcare products to as many people as possible.

Our part in tackling global health challenges and our aim to extend the benefits of our products to more people
In the heightened period of consumerism following the First World War, our legacy companies began to consolidate their products, building brand portfolios and investing in consumer advertising. This was also a period of landmark scientific breakthroughs, including the discovery of insulin and penicillin.
Beecham’s Powders  and Macleans advertisements, c.1930s 
In 1919, during the period of post-First World War consumerism, Alex Maclean’s first toothpaste appeared in British shops, and Macleans Peroxide Toothpaste was one of the first whitening formulas brought to market in 1927.
In New York, a Russian immigrant named Alexander Block opened a drugstore in 1907. He acquired several dental product brands in the 1920s and 1930s and developed a special cleansing powder for denture wearers, registered as Polident, in 1935. 
Don’t let flu grip you
In 1926, the second product of Beecham Pills and Estates Ltd. (registered two years earlier), Beecham’s Powders, was released for relief of cold and flu symptoms.
During the 1930s, the company expanded, acquiring Eno’s, Veno’s, Macleans, Lucozade and County Perfumers, to build a strong brand portfolio.

New discovery: insulin
In 1921, insulin was discovered as a way of managing diabetes. Legacy companies Burroughs Wellcome and Allen & Hanburys and were among the first in the to reproduce insulin for commercial use. By 1923, Allen & Hanburys produced 95% of the country’s insulin. 
However, by 1924, Burroughs Wellcome had modified their processes to produce insulin on a large scale from cow pancreas.

Glaxo Labs
In 1924, Joseph Nathan & Co.’s chemist, Harry Jephcott, licensed a method to produce a Vitamin supplement – Ostelin, which became the first Joseph Nathan & Co. pharmaceutical product. Joseph Nathan & Co. Ltd.’s pharmaceutical enterprise was established as a subsidiary company, Glaxo Laboratories Ltd., in 1935. 
By 1947, Glaxo Labs (as it was known) had surpassed its parent company in terms of sales and product 
range,
and bought out Joseph Nathan & Co Ltd.

Smith, Kline & French Co. also spent the 1930s and 1940s focusing on the development and sale of pharmaceuticals. Product consolidation (from over 500 to just 14 by 1937) and new product launches helped solidify the company’s reputation in speciality drug development.  
The company opened a new Philadelphia headquarters in 1949.
Sir Henry Dale, first chairman of the Wellcome Trust, c.1930s
In 1924, Henry Wellcome brought together his company, Burroughs Wellcome & Co., with his philanthropic pursuits and research entities to form the Wellcome Foundation Ltd. Upon Henry Wellcome’s death in 1936, ownership of the Foundation was transferred to the Wellcome Trust. 
Its first chairman was Sir Henry Dale, former director of Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories. In 1936, Dale won the Nobel Prize in Medicine for his landmark discovery relating to chemical transmission of nerve impulses.

Penicillin: the gamechanger
Penicillin had been d
eveloped into an 
antibiotic medicine
 during the 1930s. By 1944, Glaxo owned four facilities dedicated to producing penicillin, 
including one split-funded with Wellcome, that produced 7.5 billion units of penicillin annually. Approximately 80% of penicillin production was routed through Glaxo’s Greenford site.
In 1945, Beecham Group established the Beecham Research Laboratories, its R&arm. In 1947, a new site was opened in a ceremony officiated by Sir Alexander Fleming, the discoverer of penicillin.

Nsaje, teacher
Nsaje, teacher
As many as five students can be absent from Burega secondary school each day due to malaria. Nsaje, a teacher at the school in Kigoma, Tanzania, finds the situation frustrating, but also wishes she could do more when her students are absent. 
Hear from Nsaje, a teacher who talks about engaging young people in the fight against malaria.
She would like to offer them catch up classes or extra notes so they don’t fall behind. But in reality, the school is already understaffed and there is no formal way for students to catch up. The best she can do is suggest they copy some notes from other students.
Since Nsaje started working at Burega secondary school, two students have died from malaria. Teachers recommended the student go home and get proper testing and treatment, but she later found out the parents were poor and could not afford to take their child to the health facility so they only received paracetamol. One of the students, a girl, started to have convulsions and became paralysed and later died. There was nothing Nsaje could do to help.
Nsaje, teacher at Burega Primary School, Kigoma, Tanzania.
There are so many students missing class from malaria
If Nsaje notices a child is sick, she will take them to see the health teacher and quickly assess the symptoms. They send the child home, but if they do not get adequate treatment swiftly, they often become hospitalised and can miss up to a week of school.
Nsaje has been a teacher for 12 years and remembers a time when the malaria situation in Tanzania was far worse. She says the trained volunteers who come into the schools to teach the kids about malaria really help. They come armed with different skills and information thanks to TCDC, a project that has received funding to combat malaria thanks to a partnership between Comic Relief and Njase says malaria education only comes onto the curriculum when students are in year six (about 10/11 years old) which she feels is too late. And even then, it is only taught once. So when the community change agents arrive, their knowledge is not only much more in depth but they can reach a wider age-range of students and the students learn a lot.
Despite these efforts, malaria has not been eradicated and there are still many challenges. Nsaje and her family also repeatedly suffer from malaria. They all use nets at home and take the necessary precautions, but the disease still affects someone in the family about once every two months.

Why you don’t outgrow vaccination
Why you don’t outgrow vaccination
Vaccination plays a vital role in helping to give children a healthy start in life. What’s much less well known is that the importance of vaccination doesn’t stop when we receive our last childhood vaccination.
Vaccinate for life
New findings from our Vaccinate for life survey show that more needs to be done to communicate the benefits of vaccination throughout life and the full range of vaccines available.
The state of adult vaccination globally
If you're not sure which vaccines you need as an adult or if you are up-to-date, you are not alone. Findings from the Vaccinate for Life survey conducted by Ipsos and sponsored by Vaccines of 6,002 adults aged 18 years and over across Brazil, India, U.S., Germany and Italy showed that:
parallel survey of 1,351 healthcare professionals (HCPs) in Brazil, Italy and found that:
Don’t hesitate to talk to your healthcare provider about which vaccines you may need.
Why vaccinate throughout life?
Your immune system can visibly start to age as early as 25. For adults, some vaccines are recommended for diseases that become more of a threat as the immune system becomes less effective - making them more susceptible to disease. In other instances, previous vaccinations may also need to be topped up to help maintain immunity for example whooping cough.
Vaccination calendars are tailored to different life stages and circumstances
. Talk to your healthcare provider about which vaccines may be appropriate for you.
How vaccination can help protect communities from disease 
Vaccination can help those closest to us through “herd immunity”. Once enough people in a community have been vaccinated against a contagious disease (usually about 90%), we help protect those who haven’t been or can’t be vaccinated because the opportunity for the disease to spread is so much lower.
And it’s not just our health that suffers when we don’t vaccinate. There are also financial costs, from health care expenses and hospital stays to loss of productivity from days off work.
If you can’t remember the last time you were vaccinated, don’t hesitate to talk to your healthcare provider about which vaccines you may need.

Johari, mother of two
Johari, mother of two
Johari says that malaria not only wastes her time but is stopping her children from achieving their full potential. The mother of two is frequently taking her kids to the hospital for malaria testing and treatment. They miss school and fall behind in lessons, making her worry that the disease is denying them the chance to fulfil their dreams.
Spending so much time going back and forth to the hospital also puts a burden on her entire family and the wider community. The constant medical visits are time consuming and she wishes she had the opportunity to spend her days more productively instead.
Johari, mother of four. 
feel like malaria has wasted a lot of my time
Johari, who has had malaria several times herself, believes that the disease is more prevalent now than when she was a child. When she visits the health facility, she always sees many people waiting for malaria treatment. Her children sleep under a net, but still they get bitten frequently. She estimates one of her children is sick every few months, and they often present with malaria symptoms nearly simultaneously which can be especially demanding. TCDC, a project that has received funding to combat malaria thanks to a partnership between Comic Relief and GSK, is on the frontline of the fight against malaria in Tanzania. The project trains volunteers to go into schools and communities to educate students and residents about treatment and prevention. Johari’s children are at one of the schools in Kigoma, western Tanzania, where TCDC’s volunteers work.

Innovative entrepreneurs: 1715 – 1891
Innovative entrepreneurs: 1715 – 1891
Our history began with a remarkable group of individuals in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, who set up a range of businesses across the UK, Europe and the In pharmacies, shops and drug manufacturers, they developed innovative products including medicinal soaps and cod liver oil. Their pioneering work forms the foundation of the company we know today.

Our first pharmacy
In 1715, Silvanus Bevan opened Plough Court pharmacy, an apothecary shop, in London.
In the 1700s, apothecaries were some of the most common medical practitioners, offering medical advice and selling medicinal products.
William Allen, an office clerk, was employed by the pharmacy in 1792, and became a partner in 1795. Allen was an esteemed medical professional; he became a founding member of the Pharmaceutical Society in 1841.

Our first lab
William Allen’s nephews by marriage, the Hanbury brothers, joined the Plough Court pharmacy in the 1810s, and by 1856 the company became known as Allen & Hanburys.
The company expanded throughout the 1850s and 1860s, partly due to sales of their unique cod liver oil, which was used to prevent rickets and vitamin deficiency.
Allen & Hanburys Ltd. would eventually be acquired by Glaxo Laboratories Ltd., a legacy company. “Glaxo” is the origin of the ‘G’ in GSK.

The origins of “Smith Kline”
In 1830, the Smith & Gilbert drug house opened in Philadelphia, After Gilbert withdrew, John Smith’s younger brother George joined the company, which they built into a successful drug wholesaling business.
By 1870, their nephew Mahlon Smith was managing the company, and its bookkeeper, Mahlon Kline, had joined as a partner to form Smith, Kline & Co.
The company acquired French, Richards & Co. in 1891, to form Smith, Kline & French Company. “Smith Kline” is the origin of the ‘SK’ in GSK.

Soaps, candles and skincare 
In 1847, John David Stiefel established a candle company in Germany which later began making medicated soaps. The soaps were so popular that Stiefel began exporting them in the 1880s.
Stiefel was acquired by in 2009 – by which time it had become Stiefel Laboratories, then the world’s largest independent dermatology drug company.

From shepherd boy to factory owner
Thomas Beecham, a former shepherd, was granted a licence for his first shop in England in 1848. He developed the recipe for Beecham’s laxative pills before building what was claimed to be the first factory in the with electricity in 1887.
Beecham became a provider of healthcare products across the UK, which over a century later merged with SmithKline Beckman Corp. to form SmithKline Beecham plc.
In 1873, Joseph Nathan, a Londoner who had left the at age 17, established a general trading company in New Zealand, called Joseph Nathan & Co.
He sold haberdashery, ironmongery and meat products shipped over from London and invested the profits in land used for dairy farms.
Joseph Nathan & Co. Ltd. was bought out by its subsidiary Glaxo Laboratories Ltd. in 1947.

Malt and milk: Horlicks 
In the 1870s, London pharmacist James Horlick developed a dried malt product which he and his brother William first sold in Chicago, USA, as a dietary supplement drink to be mixed with milk.
The Horlick brothers then moved to Wisconsin, USA, where in 1883 they patented the process of purifying and drying milk with malt to make the world's first malted milk, called Horlicks Malted Milk from 1887. 
Increasing sales of Horlicks Malted Milk across the British Empire led James Horlick back to London to open an office in 1890. 
Horlicks Ltd. became part of Beecham Group in 1969. 
Partners in pharmaceuticals
In 1880, American pharmacists Henry Wellcome and Silas Burroughs began Burroughs Wellcome & Co., a drug sales partnership in London.
In 1884, they developed a new compressed tablet for medicines, trademarked as a ‘Tabloid’, to be an alternative to pills.
Tabloid medications were so successful that the company opened its first large scale manufacturing facility in 1889.

Johari, mother of four
Johari, mother of four
In 2009, Johari was one month pregnant with twins when she became seriously ill from malaria. She lacked sufficient information about how to protect herself from the life-threatening disease, and throughout the pregnancy she frequently became sick.
Johari Msubaha , the Secretary of the Kanyabeza womens’s group.
When her babies were born - one boy and one girl - she was relieved to find they were both healthy. But soon realised that the second born - her son, Hussein - had challenges. He was always poorly, and nearly every month she took him to the hospital for a check-up where he would get tested for malaria, and treated if the results were positive.
In the future there will still be a lot of challenges because people are still getting sick from malaria, but I’m not losing hope because of that. am still fighting because know things are going to change.
Caring for her very sick child put an emotional and financial burden on Johari and her family. She felt she could not adequately protect her children and was at a loss what to do. Then she met the chairwoman of the Kanyabeza Community Group who encouraged her to become a member. It is a small micro-finance group comprised of mostly women who live in a rural community outside Kigoma, a town in western Tanzania. The group gets its name from a nearby river. Each member must play an initial membership fee plus a small weekly contribution (less than £1) at every meeting. The money is pooled and given to members who apply for a loan, which they have to repay with interest. The interest is saved and used to help other members when they are faced with an unexpected financial burden - for example, if a child suddenly becomes ill and they need to take him to a hospital for treatment. It has become a lifeline for many who would have no other means of accessing money at short notice.
When Johari first told her husband she wanted to join the Kanyabeza Community Group, he had his reservations. Women in her community are not encouraged to be independent thinkers or self-sufficient. They are responsible for staying home and looking after the kids, and are typically given no money to support themselves or their children, even if they become ill. Luckily, Johari’s husband soon came around to the idea and has now even bought shares in the Kanybeza group himself, one of the only men to be a member.
Johari was embraced by the rest of the group who voted her in as secretary. She felt her confidence grow and has received vital education about malaria, sexually transmitted diseases, birth control and nutrition advice. She feels that the malaria situation in her community is starting to improve thanks to the work of organisations like the Tanzania Communications and Development Center, which receives money through a Comic Relief/partnership. trains volunteers to go into communities and inform groups how to stay safe and protect themselves. Johari has four children - a 17-year-old, six-year-old twins and a two-year-old - and they have been malaria free for six months.

These fifty years were pivotal in our history. During this period, we developed the first treatment for HIV, enhanced our consumer brands and developed new treatments for asthma. Company consolidation led to the formation of SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo Wellcome, which would ultimately merge to become GSK.

What’s exciting about a nucleus?
Scientists at Beecham Research Labs (Beecham’s R&subsidiary, registered in 1945) began focusing their development efforts on penicillin production in 1954. In 1957, they discovered the penicillin nucleus – the core of the molecule – known as 6-From this nucleus, they determined that they could develop new, more effective penicillins.
Nobel Prize-winning discoveries  
At Burroughs Wellcome & Co. (USA), the Wellcome Foundation’s subsidiary, the research team under Dr. George Hitchings made a series of important discoveries from 1951 to 1981, including some of the first treatments for leukaemia, gout, viral infections and organ transplant rejection. Hitchings, along with Gertrude Elion, won the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1988 for their revolutionary discoveries of important principles for drug treatment.
In 1984, Burroughs Wellcome & Co. scientist Marty St. Clair was at the forefront of developing the 
first treatment for HIV
 - which was approved in 1987 - utilising the methods pioneered by Elion and Hitchings.

In 1957, Burroughs Wellcome & Co. (USA) introduced a new treatment for cold and flu symptoms, Sudafed, followed by Actifed two years later, both of which became popular consumer brands.
In 1960, Contac was launched by Smith Kline & French Co. and became the world’s best-selling cold and allergy treatment.

Oral care products 
In 1973, Beecham Group released a new toothpaste, Aquafresh, which quickly became known for its stripes. The first two stripes were for fighting tooth decay and fresh breath. The third stripe was added in 1981, for healthy gums.

Glaxo takes on asthma
Glaxo Laboratories Ltd. acquired Allen & Hanburys Ltd. in 1958. In 1963, a research team was formed to focus on developing an effective asthma treatment; the first medicine was introduced in 1969, and several more followed over the subsequent decades. 
Scientists at Glaxo also worked to improve the mechanism of delivery with an easier to use device.

Drug discovery: ulcer treatment
Scientists at Smith Kline & French Laboratories developed a breakthrough treatment for ulcer sufferers in 1976, which sold over $1 billion two years later. The company’s Sir James Black was awarded a Nobel Prize for his research methods that aided this discovery.
And then there were two…
In 1989, SmithKline Corp. (the parent company of Smith Kline & French Laboratories) merged with the Beecham Group plc to form SmithKline Beecham plc.
In 1986, the Wellcome Trust publicly sold shares of the Wellcome Foundation Ltd. to form Wellcome plc. In 1995, the Trust sold its remaining shares to Glaxo plc, forming the world’s largest pharmaceutical company, Glaxo Wellcome plc.
Thus, by 1995, the majority of our legacy companies had fed into either Glaxo Wellcome or SmithKline Beecham.

In 2016, 13-year-old Patrick started to feel ill while his mother was out farming. He began to vomit, had diarrhoea and was shivering. Then his joints started to hurt and his body and his head ached.
Patrick, 13, a student at Kibirizi Primary School in Kigoma, Tanzania.
In an attempt to stop the shivering, Patrick stood in the sunshine hoping it would warm him up, but it did not help. With his mother at work and no one else to turn to, Patrick was forced to wait until she got home to get help.
Patrick’s mother immediately knew her son was very sick, but had no money to take him to the hospital and buy medication. She asked her neighbours, but they were too poor to help either. Finally, the chairman of the hamlet where the family lives gave her some money and Patrick was rushed to hospital. Doctors told him he had severe malaria and he was admitted for three days, given medication and eventually recovered.
Hear from Patrick, a school boy, about his experience of malaria.
have educated my younger siblings about malaria and talk to the neighbours and my friends. I’ve learnt about malaria from the mobile video units - there were times when it came to my community. learn about malaria at school as well. It helps a lot.

Leonard, father, farmer and assistant
Leonard, father, farmer and assistant
When Leonard was 19 years old, his firstborn baby became gravely sick. Leonard took him to a local witch doctor who told him the child was bewitched. By the time anyone realised that it was actually severe malaria, it was too late. The baby had convulsions and soon died. That experience shaped Leonard’s life and drove him to dedicate much of his life to helping combat malaria.
Leonard, a health care worker from the Mahembe community for Malaria.
When realised my baby had malaria, it was too late. That pushed me to start working for malaria awareness.
Leonard, now 35, is a community-minded man and comes from a family of doctors and health providers. He always wanted to work in a health-related field so since the age of 20, he has tried to educate others about malaria prevention and treatment. He volunteers at a local health dispensary in the Mahembe community in Kigoma, Tanzania, where he lives. He also meets with small business groups, such as the local tailors, as well as community or church groups to tell them how to stay safe and urges them to pass the message onto their customers, neighbours and friends. Leonard receives training about malaria prevention and treatment from the Tanzania Communication and Development Center, which receives money from a Comic Relief/partnership to help combat malaria.
At the dispensary, Leonard works as an assistant health care provider for a few hours most mornings. He tests people using the rapid diagnostic test, a simple pin-prick blood test. If they are positive, he sends them to the pharmacy to receive medication. He also informs them how to take the drugs, impressing on them the importance of completing the full dose. He talks to people about the actions they can take to prevent getting sick again: use a net, wear long sleeves and trousers after dusk, cut long grasses and clear away any pools of stagnant water around the house that could become a mosquito breeding site. He does all this in addition to his work as a farmer cultivating cassava and maize. He has a wife and three children.
Leonard says it is the memory of his firstborn who died from undetected malaria that drives him. He tells people about his own experiences in the hope they will not have to suffer the same experience 
Leonard has seen a lot of progress during the past 15 years. He says people are now actively asking for nets, they are no longer assuming they have malaria and taking medication unnecessarily, instead they will request a test if they start to feel unwell. They are also completing their malaria dose and actively seeking out his advice. But he knows there is still room for improvement to stamp out the disease altogether. He wants to make sure there is a constant supply of malaria drugs and diagnostic tests and always tries to inform the district malaria representative if there is a near stock out. Malaria drugs also cost money and not everyone can afford them. He thinks there should be more mobile cinemas in communities disseminating educational messages about malaria as word of mouth and leaflets can only do so much.

Jacob, Tanzania Communication and Dev...
Jacob, Tanzania Communication and Development Centre
Jacob is on the front line of the fight against malaria in Tanzania. As field operations manager for the Tanzania Communication and Development Centre (TCDC), he spends his time traveling the country and seeing first-hand how the project’s multi-pronged approach to malaria education and prevention is helping to stamp out the disease.
from the Tanzania Communication Development Centre talks about the power of education to help fight malaria.
He has worked at for four years and is proud of the work that it does. This includes using radio and segments to promote malaria messaging and sending mobile cinemas and road shows into communities. also works with local NGOs and trains so-called “community change agents” who are volunteers that to go into their own communities to talk to groups, schools and teachers about how to protect against malaria.
Jacob knows that it is vital that TCDC’s educational messages about malaria treatment and prevention reach all sections of society as using a net is only one part of the battle. It is crucial that communities also know they must clear away pools of stagnant water that can become mosquito breeding sites, for example. It is also vital that they trust the rapid diagnostic tests that detect malaria and complete full courses of treatment.
Jacob Macha, Head of Programmes, Tanzania Communication Development Centre (TCDC)
This funding will help us move more towards behaviour change
Jacob loves his job and says he has already seen some real progress. Country-wide, malaria has declined from 20% prevalence five years ago to 14% today. In Kigoma, western Tanzania, the area with the second-highest malaria rates in the country, prevalence is now 38% compared to 50% five years ago. Thanks to a Comic Relief/partnership, is looking to take its malaria work to the next level. This will involve making sure that people are not just aware about how malaria spreads and seeking treatment, but taking the initiative to try and eradicate it in their local areas. He hopes that in the next five to 10 years he will see lasting behaviour change and believes that only by being truly engaged and working together will communities across Tanzania be able to reduce the number of children and adults getting sick each year – and eventually stamp malaria out entirely.
