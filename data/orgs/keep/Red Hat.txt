is the second-largest contributor to the upstream Kubernetes project and the originator of many of its key features, components, and related container technologies. We have years of experience running Kubernetes in the cloud and supporting organizations using containers in production. Today, we're working with the cloud-native community to push the boundaries of wcontainers and Kubernetes can do, from serverless computing to machine learning.
Hat's dedication to, support of, and decades of involvement in open source communities lets us contribute useful technology, refine and harden it, and prepare it for the enterprise. This engagement comes with a promise : Keep these technologies open so everyone can help create, promote, and maintain better open source software and discourage patent aggression.

Open hybrid cloud brings the interoperability, workload portability, and flexibility of open source to hybrid environments, bridging them together and creating a unified experience.
Hat's development model begins in open source communities and results in stable, enterprise-ready solutions.

How the best ideas become enterprise‑ready
Innovation doesn't happen by chance. It's the outcome of a proven process. The                     Hat® development                     model begins in the open source community, with thousands of contributors, and results in finished                     products tare tried, tested, and trusted.
We build open source solutions for the enterprise
An open development model connects engineers to open source communities . Members of                             these communities work together to identify and elevate the best ideas. supports                             these communities by contributing to the code, and by creating products from upstream                             projects.
We’re involved in many open source communities, building and refining the technologies t                            make up today’s environments. From the operating system to storage, to middleware, and                             containers—all the way up to management and automation—is building open                             source                             solutions with certifications and services for the enterprise.
closer look at the development of Ansible Engine
Ansible is the upstream community of the product teventually becomes Ansible Engine —agentless enterprise—grade automation software. The community was founded in                         2012 and made                         the 2017 GitHub Octoverse report in the categories                         of most reviewed, most discussed, and most                         contributors.
Every day, community members work on new modules, update existing modules, and contribute to the                         basic and core code tmake modules possible. The turnaround time on Ansible Engine is fast,                         with a new release every 1—3 months. Thanks to the dedication of the upstream community,                         and                         Hat’s enterprise—level experience, Ansible Engine has become a powerful way for customers                         to                         build and write playbooks.
More eyes. More secure.
The community—to—enterprise development model often results in more                                     secure software                                     compato proprietary software for 3 core reasons. First: When everyone can see                                     the code, more threats can be discovered. Next: Issues tarise get patched                                     quickly because the source code is accessible. Finally: takes responsibility                                     for testing, hardening, and supporting open source software, so every customer                                     shares the same level of assurance.
Open source software doesn’t require a licensing fee—which results in a clear                                     advantage when examining the cost to deploy a solution. However, massive development savings are also represented in a community—based distribution. One estimate                                     shows                                     twhen you account for inflation at the time, it would cost approximately US$10.8                                     billion to build the Fedora 9 distribution from scratch.(*) The                                     contributors who                                     work on Linux® projects share this development burden over time.
Open source communities are free to innovate without the barriers of patents. We                                     believe tsoftware patents impede innovation in software development and                                     discourage open source innovation. For this reason, we issued our first patent                                     promise in 2002 to discourage patent aggression—and in 2017, we expanded this                                     promise.
With proprietary solutions, there's always a risk tthe company could discontinue                                     the code. With open source software, however, there's no risk of discontinuation.                                     Even if the vendor stops distributing a certain product, the code will                                     remain available for use and improvement.

is the second-largest contributor to the upstream Kubernetes project and the originator of many of its key features, components, and related container technologies. We have years of experience running Kubernetes in the cloud and supporting organizations using containers in production. Today, we're working with the cloud-native community to push the boundaries of wcontainers and Kubernetes can do, from serverless computing to machine learning.
Hat's dedication to, support of, and decades of involvement in open source communities lets us contribute useful technology, refine and harden it, and prepare it for the enterprise. This engagement comes with a promise : Keep these technologies open so everyone can help create, promote, and maintain better open source software and discourage patent aggression.
We believe in the power of open hybrid cloud. Standalone cloud deployments based on proprietary technology aren't the answer because they inhibit clouds from interacting with one another. Open hybrid cloud brings the interoperability, workload portability, and flexibility of open source to hybrid environments, bridging them together and creating a unified experience.
Hat's development model begins in open source communities and results in stable, enterprise-ready solutions.

Every solution starts with sharing a problem. Technology thrives in the open, where people are free to share their ideas and build on the work of others.
Creation is always an act of collaboration.
At Hat, when we talk about " open source ," we're talking about a proven way of collaborating to create technology. The freedom to see the code, to learn from it, to ask questions and offer improvements: This is the open source way.

When useful open source technology emerges, we test it, harden it, and make it secure and reliable. Then we gather, package, and support it as enterprise products.
More eyes. More secure.
While it might seem counterintuitive, open source software is often more secure than proprietary software. In fact, debugging and securing software is part of the essence and common purpose of software communities.
More eyes. Fewer bugs. Sunlight really is the best disinfectant.

Together, they will help clients create cloud-native business applications faster, drive greater portability and security of data and applications across multiple public and private clouds, all with consistent cloud management. In doing so, they will draw on their shaleadership in key technologies, such as Linux, containers, Kubernetes, multi-cloud management, and cloud management and automation.
IBM’s and Hat’s partnership has spanned 20 years, with serving as an early supporter of Linux, collaborating with to help develop and grow enterprise-grade Linux and more recently to bring enterprise Kubernetes and hybrid cloud solutions to customers. These innovations have become core technologies within IBM’s $19 billion hybrid cloud business. Between them, and have contributed more to the open source community than any other organization.
“Today’s announcement is the evolution of our long-standing partnership,” said Rometty. “This includes our joint Hybrid Cloud collaboration announcement in May, a key precursor in our journey to this day.”

Jim Whitehurst also will join IBM’s senior management team and report to Ginni Rometty. intends to maintain Hat’s headquarters, facilities, brands and practices.
“IBM’s commitment to keeping the things thave made successful - always thinking about the customer and the open source community first – make this a tremendous opportunity for not only but also open source more broadly,” said Paul Cormier, President, Products and Technologies, Hat. “Since the day we decided to bring open source to the enterprise, our mission has remained unchanged. And now, one of the biggest enterprise technology companies on the planet has agreed to partner with us to scale and accelerate our efforts, bringing open source innovation to an even greater swath of the enterprise.”
The acquisition of reinforces IBM’s high-value model. It will accelerate IBM’s revenue growth, gross margin and free cash flow within 12 months of closing. It also will support a solid and growing dividend.
