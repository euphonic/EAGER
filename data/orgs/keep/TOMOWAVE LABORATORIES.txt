develops proprietary optoacoustic tomography and laser ultrasound systems for combined functional/molecular and anatomical imaging with applications in detection of cancer and image-guided interventions
technology employs the principles of optoacoustic (photoacoustic or thermoacoustic) tomography. Laser Optoacoustic imaging System illuminates tissues by short laser pulses with dark red color. Absorption of laser energy specifically by tissue molecules selected by the wavelength of laser light increases tissue temperature to a small fraction of one degree, simultaneously generating local pressure. Thermal expansion of the heated voxels of tissue launches acoustic pressure waves (ultrasound). By measuring these ultrasound waves at different locations using arrays of transducers we obtain images of internal tissue structures and distribution of hemoglobin and other molecules of medical interest. By listening to the sound of light, systems can help doctors to detect and diagnose cancer and potentially other notorious diseases using functional and molecular information.
Laser Optoacoustic Ultrasonic Imaging System Assembly (LOUISA3D) is presently the main focus of commercialization

Non-invasive clinical breast imaging that produces three-dimensional volumetric images of the breast, along with two-dimensional ultrasonic images for image co-registration.Our Story
In 1880, Alexander Bell heard “a pure musical tune” in a a closed gas volume that has absorbed a modulated sunlight beam. However, it was decades later that the physicists had employed this discovery in medical applications. It wasn’t until the early 20th century that the photoacoustic/optoacoustic effecthad become a sensitive technology for detection of malignant tumors. Int he beginning of the 20th century, when the first highly sensitive microphones were first designed, spectroscopy experts began to utilize the photoacoustic effect for the characterize of molecular content in gas mixtures. In 1964, shortly after the discovery of lasers, intense pulses of light were employed to enhance dramatically the effectiveness of photoacoustic generation.
Since then, a number of applications in nondestructive evaluation and spectroscopic characterization of solid and liquid materials have been found for the photoacoustic effect.  In early 1980-s Alan Rosencwaig, Theodore Bowen, Myron Wolbarsht and other researchers independently proposed the use of laser photoacoustic effect for various medical diagnostic procedures.  However, only the 1990s brought about technological breakthroughs that allowed our Labs founder,  Dr. Alexander Oraevsky , to initiate work on designing a novel technology for biomedical visualization combining the advantages of optical and acoustic imaging. Immediately, several groups followed this direction.  In the beginning of the 21st century the necessary critical mass of resources (human and financial) has been achieved and optoacoustic imaging (also called photoacoustic imaging) has become one of the fastest growing technologies in the area of biomedical imaging.
In a short period of time, since the establishment of our company in 2011, has come a long way in developing efficient systems through optical and acoustic modifications. Our systems include Optoacoustic Imaging Systems for preclinical and clinical research purposes. Many of our components are fully customizable to your specifications and medical imaging needs. We are also able to provide certain system components such electronics, imaging modules as well as tubing for your research needs. Please  contact us  for further information regarding.
