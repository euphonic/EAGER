Hello, we're We are world leaders in adaptive focus lens technologies. As well as developing autofocus glasses to overcome the loss of near vision as you get older, works with partners to enable their next generations of AR/platforms to be genuinely immersive and visually comfortable.
Adaptive optics is an opportunity to enhance vision not just restore it. We can see a future that is truly “heads-up and hands-free”.
future where people will use eyewear even if they don’t have an underlying prescription - because their visual experience will be so much clearer, sharper and richer. Optical characteristics and focus will adjust automatically for the task and the environment, so your vision will always be optimal.
What you can see will be further augmented with real-time data and graphical information to create a new reality where the virtual and the real world are in sharp focus and seamlessly integrated.
is a diverse team of people including scientists, engineers and designers obsessed with giving people better vision. We are excited about pushing new lens technologies and see our role as perfecting the interfaces between the real and virtual worlds, our eyes and our brain.
We are based near Oxford and work with leading global technology and ophthalmic companies.
Interested in what we can do for you?
In the and spheres, we are working with technology partners to help make step changes to the user experience. Using our technologies, we can eliminate the need for separate prescription eyewear, manage the effects of presbyopia and deal with the vergence accommodation conflict (VAC). This helps deliver a truly immersive experience with improved visual clarity as well as eliminating feelings of nausea and disorientation.
With our and technologies 3images can be accurately rendered at any distance. This is important for visual comfort, for integrating augmented reality with the real world and, uniquely, enabling you to focus on objects and content within arms-reach. Our technologies also allow you to reduce the overall design envelope and reduce the bulk of headsets.
Our founder and key shareholder, James Chen, is a venture philanthropist who has become gripped                                 by one issue: 2.5 billion people still struggle with poor vision without treatment. He co-founded                                 to investigate the technology, followed by Vision for a Nation a charity supporting emerging nations – starting with Rwanda – in                                 providing affordable glasses and primary eye care. Recently James launched the Clearly campaign to inspire promote greater awareness of the global vision issue. His                                 mission is to see a world where everyone has access to vision correction.
John is the one who knits it together. Mesmerized by the juggling people do to ensure they have glasses                             to hand, he knows there’s a better way. An engineer by training, he’s built his experience in                             tech and consumer growth businesses. When not at work a bicycle never seems far away.
Rob talks, thinks, breathes physics & optics. He is responsible for developing all the technology                             that is fundamental to Adlens. If science hasn’t defined it yet as impossible, he’s up for it.                             Prior to he was to be found teaching at Oxford University. Cars, children and badminton                             also vie for his attention.
