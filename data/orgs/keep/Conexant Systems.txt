You can be forgiven for being surprised by how fast and wide the “voice assistant” market has grown, also known as Automated Speech Recognition (ASR) and Artificial Intelligence(AI). Few anticipated the breakneck speed with which the multitude of intelligent, voice-controlled products have come to market.
But we saw it coming a mile away!
Synaptics recognized early on the immense potential for voice assistants, as evidenced by our strategic acquisition of advanced voice/audio technology, which meshed nicely with our existing human interface solutions. That successful integration has evolved into our robust AudioSmart® technology, which features truly cutting-edge voice- and audio-processing capabilities. Through AudioSmart, Synaptics has become the only company supporting all major voice assistant platforms with shipping products – and is enabling an astounding array of consumer Internet of Things (IoT) applications.
To give some context to those claims, consider this sampling of diverse applications in which Synaptics voice assistant solutions are found at retail today:, bathroom mirrors, refrigerators, smoke alarms, lighting and light switches, routers, PCs, set-top boxes, sound bars, televisions, thermostats, and of course numerous global smart speakers with connectivity including Wi-Fi and now Bluetooth with Docomo.
Add to those examples an extensive roster of global technology leaders we partner with and whose voice-interaction products AudioSmart can support: Alibaba, Amazon, Anker, ASUS, Baidu, First Alert, General Electric, Google, Harman Kardon, HP, IBM, KT, Microsoft, Naver, Docomo, Polk, and Samsung, just to name a few.
Alexa and Google Assistant are arguably the most recognizable voice-interaction services today. But other services are rapidly growing or enjoy a solid market presence of their own, including Bixby, Clova, Cortana, DuerOS, and Siri. And all of them are supported by AudioSmart, because it was architected to be service-agnostic.
representative example of AudioSmart’s versatility can be found in how it was selected to help expand Microsoft’s Cortana ecosystem, including the Skype communications platform, into home entertainment, personal computing, mobile devices and automotive electronics. Partnerships like that and the success they breed demand technological prowess, dedicated collaboration and trust in one another’s market visions.
The support Synaptics provides its partners doesn’t end with the AudioSmart technology’s advanced voice- and audio-processing devices. That support also includes extensive design services and development kits that provide partners with guidance on development issues and help transform product concepts into complete, revenue-generating solutions. Designers are further empowered through Synaptics’ reference design tools that streamline product development. For instance, AudioSmart 4-mic and 2-mic development kits enable anyone to quickly prototype and develop high-performance far-field devices with Amazon Alexa.
One anecdote that highlights the tools’ versatility and ease of use, which I’ve cited before but bears repeating, is that it required changing just a few lines of code to convert an Alexa-service device to one based on DuerProduct manufacturers can leverage a one-time investment in hardware based on Synaptics’ solution to service many markets worldwide with a simple software change. That versatility, coupled with guidance through our design services and tools, means both faster time-to-market and lower development costs.
Designers reading that anecdote must be breathing a sigh of relief, because they know all too well that so many elements -- components, software and precious time -- go into voice assistant enabled products, so that getting problem-solving guidance, as well as a much needed break on time for coding, is a gift. Product tear-downs on sites such as iFixIt.com help convey the sophistication of voice assistant devices and the challenges of making their hardware and software work in concert with one another.
The voice assistant market shows no signs of cooling off. According to Markit, the serviceable available market for smart-home products is expected to exceed $2.5 billion by 2020, up from $1.4 billion this year. And the overall global voice recognition market is projected to reach $128 billion by 2024, based on a study by Grand View Research.
While this market may be red-hot, we’ve really just scratched the surface. We have big ideas in store with and edge computing for both performance and security reasons. And expect voice assistant technology to be deployed well beyond the smart speakers and applications commonly associated with it today, to use-cases few envisioned at the technology’s advent. In other words, those applications will elevate voice assistants to new heights, notably in automotive. But that’s a topic for a future Synaptics discussion.
In the meantime, take a moment to marvel at all the amazing ways AudioSmart technology is advancing the human interface through its voice assistant technology.

More infoNew Solutions Include Powerful VideoSmart VS-550 Sow/Built-in for New Smart STBs, and a Plug-in Accessory for Existing STBs
Consumer demand for smart speakers to control music and home automation is rapidly growing, and smart home users now expect to be able to naturally use their voice to control their experience without having to hunt for a custom remote control. Synaptics’ new AudioSmart and VideoSmart solutions represent a powerful blend of the latest voice, audio and video technologies that enhance capabilities of Android STBs while enabling them to be more space- and cost-efficient. That combination benefits consumers and the television ecosystem including service providers, makers, and plug-in device makers.
“Through our strategic acquisitions of innovative companies and complementary technologies, Synaptics is leveraging those acquired assets’ synergy to create highly integrated human interface solutions,” said Huibert Verhoeven, senior vice president and general manager, IoDivision, Synaptics. “Our comprehensive portfolio of market-leading voice and video solutions offer service providers a one-stop-shop technology partner that can help enhance their subscription services for a compelling consumer experience.”
Synaptics’ AudioSmart capabilities are already market-proven in service provider STBs and were previously available only through discrete DSPs such as those deployed with major customers in South Korea. Now Synaptics has designed its Sowith integrated that offers higher performance for enhanced voice processing capabilities. The VideoSmart VS-550 Sowith quad core 15DMIPs performance and gaming caliber graphics is a market-leading solution for Android set-top-boxes and is currently being deployed across several Pay operators around the world.
The VS-550 infused with AudioSmart capabilities provides STBs with a single-chip solution with voice features for all major speech-recognition engines, including those from Google and Amazon, as well as service providers’ own proprietary services. That integration also enables multimedia designs with higher performance and more features than before, such as improved echo cancelation; more-powerful noise suppression; a customizable, high-performance voice-trigger solution; and industry-leading voice barge-in technology enabled by full-duplex acoustic echo cancellation which detects the wake-word even when the volume is high. Enabling a solution in STBs is especially challenging, when compared to smart speakers, given that the audio playback is coming through speakers. The Synaptics solution overcomes this challenge with unique, proprietary technology which is field-proven, having been deployed in STBs for many years using AudioSmart discrete DSPs.
More than 300 million STBs shipped worldwide in 2017 – a figure expected to reach nearly 360 million units in 2018, according to a report by ResearchAndMarkets.com. While STBs in development can have Synaptics’ new highly integrated VideoSmart Sowith AudioSmart designed-in directly, millions among the installed base of STBs don’t have capabilities. To minimize service provider capital expenditures, Synaptics also offers a solution for ODMs to develop a simple to use plug-in accessory that takes advantage of ports common in STBs, thus enhancing existing users’ experience with rich features and provides a lower-cost alternative to standalone voice-assistant device.
