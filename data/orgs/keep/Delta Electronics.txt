Delta's labs at Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, U.S.A., include the Power Laboratory, which develops high-efficiency and high-density power conversion products, and the Networks R&Laboratory, which develops networking products. Delta's R&team in Soest, Germany, focuses on developing key power supply products and technologies for various applications such as hybrid vehicles, super computers, high-end server storage, telecommunications, datacenters, and wind power converters.
Among Delta's 23 R&centers in China, Power Center (DPEC) in Pudong, Shanghai was established in 1999 to aggressively develop advanced energy-saving technologies. We also have (China National Accreditation Service for Conformity Assessment) accredited laboratories in Shanghai, Guangdong and Jiangsu, as well as post Ph.innovation stations in our R&centers in Shanghai and Jiangsu.
Cultivation for R&Talents
has also made long-term investments in cultivating R&expertise and innovation. has joint R&programs with universities such as MIT, Virginia Polytech, Case Western Reserve University, as well as Taiwan's National Cheng-Kung University, National Central University, and National Taiwan University, and other top schools in both Taiwan and China. In China, the Foundation has established the "Power Science and Education Development Program" and the "Scholar Program," which are involved in co-developing a variety of advanced energy-efficient products and technologies with eight top universities.
Our capability for innovative design is what sets us apart from the competition. With our core competence in power management, we are rapidly expanding into several related businesses such as: power systems for datacenters, cooling fans and thermal solutions, industrial automation systems, powertrain solutions and power components for EVs/HEVs, high-end projection systems, lighting, and renewable energy. We are also actively pursuing development in new areas such as medium voltage drives (MVD), converters for wind turbines, and green buildings.
Delta's telecom power supplies lead the industry with an energy conversion efficiency of up to 98%. In 2012, successfully developed the world's first titanium-grade server power supply with an efficiency rating reaching 96%. For onboard chargers for electric vehicles, takes advantage of high power efficiency of up to 96% with greater user-friendliness, protection, and network integration. In recent years we have developed high-density and high-efficiency products and solutions which allow the general public to enjoy our innovative green technology. For fan and thermal management, is actively leveraging low-power consumption and low-noise designs to extend our product lines into smart air exchange fans, hot-air blowers and thermal exchangers.

As a world-class corporate citizen, is dedicated to developing its corporate social responsibility. To Delta, encompasses sound corporate governance, balancing stakeholder benefits, focusing on environmental issues, protecting the Earth’s environment, promoting energy-saving education, and contributing to society. In 2015, published the book “Delta’s Plan for Action on Climate Change” that describes the company’s environmental commitments, core technology and capabilities in energy efficiency and power electronics, as well as global businesses With employees and partners involved, the book addresses climate action plans, shares their concerns on climate change issues, and enhances the Company's international influence In response to the Climate Disclosure Project, has demonstrated its three commitments in “We Mean Business”, such as disclosing climate change information, influencing carbon reduction policies and voluntarily reducing carbon emissions. In response to global warming, all members of participate in energy-saving actions.
Achievements on the “We Mean Business” Initiative
Climate change is an issue that has focused on for a long time. Dealing with climate change has become an extension of the brand and our corporate social responsibility commitments. We were a leader in publishing the Climate Action Plan in 2015. We publicly committed to the CDP's "Commit to Action" carbon reduction campaign, signed the "We Mean Business" initiative, and committed to adopting a science based emissions reduction target, reporting climate change information in mainstream reports as a fiduciary duty, and engaging in a responsible corporate climate policy.
supports the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) established by the has worked toward achieving the SDGs through various projects, as stated in the first pages of this Report’s Governance, Environment, and Society chapters. We have also correlated the 13 material topics identified by stakeholders to the 17 SDGs, and focused on six, including: 4) Quality Education, 7) Affordable and Clean Energy, 9) Industry Innovation and Infrastructure, 12) Responsible Consumption and Production, 13) Climate Action, and 17) Partnership for the Goals. These SDGs will serve as the direction of Delta’s efforts toward sustainable development. In addtion, twelve major issues were identified from Delta's stakeholders through materiality analysis. From the economic aspect, Innovative R&D, Information System Security Management, Customer Relationship Management, and Supplier Sustainability Management were included. From the environmental aspect, Climate Change, Green Product Responsibility, Energy Management, and Water Resources Management were included. From the social aspect, Talent Attraction and Retention, Human Rights, Human Capital Development, and Social Participation were included. All twelve of these major issues specifically explain the results of Delta's investment and key development direction for the future based on "Alignment with SDGs", "Strategic Policies", "Commitment", "2020 Vision", "Key Initiatives for the Alignment with SDGs", and "Future Plans".
