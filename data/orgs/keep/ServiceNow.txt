Formal collaboration across teams can help you implement new tech safely and effectively
Most companies today lack sufficient C‑suite experience to     execute strategies
Cross‑functional groups such as     councils can aid in decision‑making
“fact sheets” can     help companies set standards for quality and ethics
Lack of senior‑level awareness and expertise is blocking progress on   at many companies. While almost all executives at big companies say   is important, just 17% say they’re familiar with the technology,   according to a 2017 Deloitte survey of 1,500 C‑level execs at   companies with at least 500 employees.
So how is it that companies are spending $19 billion on   systems and applications in 2018, and are expected to invest up to $57   billion by 2021, according to IDC?  small but elite group of   executive black belts appear to be shouldering most of the burden.   More  than half the execs who told Deloitte they were familiar with   are juggling between three and 10 pilot projects at any given time.
It’s no surprise why: most projects have evolved as grassroots   efforts in recent years. As applications emerged, companies let a   thousand flowers bloom. Experts are now saying they need to tend the   garden by taking a more strategic approach. 
That’s why many companies are adopting new management tactics to   tackle the biggest challenge in getting started with AI—sorting   through proposals, options, vendors and requirements, and deciding   which projects to greenlight. Some are deputizing special councils and   committees to accelerate decision‑making. Others are developing   “fact sheets” in an effort to establish quality and ethical standards.
"Companies need to develop more thoughtful approaches to   exploit AI,” says Karl Freund, consulting lead for deep learning at   Moor Insights and Strategies. “They need to consider how all the   pieces of the puzzle fit together, across the entirety of their business.”
California‑based Farmers Insurance has invested aggressively in in   recent years. One project frees up time for claim adjusters by using   image recognition to detect anomalies and fraud in auto insurance   claims. Farmers has deployed chatbots to interact with customers in   its contact centers.  Finally, Farmers uses robotic process automation   (RPA) to automate mundane back‑office processes.
Most of these projects bubbled up from below, often without unified   support from senior management, says Tom Davenport, a fellow of the   Initiative on the Digital Economy and a senior advisor to Deloitte   Analytics. So, Farmers execs formed two committees to start driving   decision‑making from the top—with dual roles for the business side and IT.
The business‑side “Council” focuses on major problems the company   needs to solve, use cases that align to those problems, and   business objectives. The sister council, run out of IT, identifies   enterprise tools and data sets that can help to build out the   appropriate systems. It either buys solutions that are specific to   the insurance industry, or develops them internally. For example,   Farmers has developed chatbots in‑house using open‑source industry   frameworks, Davenport says.
This approach helps executives distill order from chaos. “The   councils are a response to the feeling that things were getting out of   control [with AI], and people were using too many different types of   software and paying the same vendor multiple times,” Davenport says.   Now the company is moving towards more “centralization and control.”
Health benefits giant Anthem, on the other hand, sought more   centralized control of its activities from the start. An IT‑led   group, dubbed the “Cognitive Capability Center,” began coordinating   projects in 2011 when it first began exploring the technology, says   chief digital officer Rajeev Ronanki.
Initially, the team focused on use cases for two key areas: process   automation and data analytics. With rapid advances in machine learning   and applications, managers soon realized they needed a more   distributed approach and launched several specialist teams to cover   needs across major business units. Anthem then created a chief   officer position to centralize decision‑making.
The initial effort “morphed into a much broader set of capabilities   that’s now embedded into our enterprise,” says Ronanki. “There isn’t   just one place where all the happens.”
councils can also help break down walls to get two key   requirements of initiatives—data and money—flowing where they need   to go.
Davenport cautions that no best practices yet exist for executing   strategy. Companies take varying approaches to project ownership,   technical standards and budgets.
Standardized models need to emerge, says Gayle Sirard, North America   lead for Accenture Applied Intelligence. At a minimum, she recommends   a governance model, an operating model, prioritized use cases, an   implementation roadmap, and a business case to define and capture value.
While systems obviously need quality standards and ethical   boundaries, governance might be the least mature practice in that   laundry list. It’s also the one that many companies need help with.   That’s one reason why researchers have started using what they   call “fact sheets” to document the performance of algorithms for   business executives.
“services and solutions should come with some statement of   performance and quality control,” says Research fellow Aleksandra   Mojsilovic. “How do you know that this service is what you need, that   it’s appropriate for your problem and that it will behave according to   the requirements you put on paper?”
Among other ideas, Mojsilovic suggests companies require a “supplier   declaration of conformity” that answers technical questions about an   algorithm’s quality and behavior. Executives can use these   declarations to audit projects and ensure they meet basic standards.
Companies in the Deloitte survey listed “making better decisions” as   their second‑most desired benefit of Until everyone agrees on best   practices for project governance, the wise course is to experiment   with a few different approaches to see which ones ultimately prevail.

By helping people feel safe, respected, valued, and heard, we hope to empower them in the workplace to be who they truly are and contribute their best work without reservations.
When we belong, we feel respected and appreciated. Every employee deserves to feel they belong.
Here are a few ways we’re working to increase diversity, inclusion, and belonging at ServiceNow.
We’re encouraging each other to embrace a learning mindset during leadership summits and other employee events. With access to LinkedIn Learning, all employees around the world, across levels, and with varying abilities, can engage in personal improvement.
Employees are coming together as one group—in a community for action—to help educate each other through our internal social media platform and in learning sessions. Our Employee Voice Surveys also encourage employees to share what shapes their experiences.
At our first-ever Women’s Leadership Summit, female and male senior leaders came together to listen, learn, and take ownership towards driving inclusion. We’re also working with the Clayman Institute for Gender Research, AnitaB.org, and the Center for Talent Innovation to evolve our thinking.
Evolving inclusive practices and programs
We’re fostering an inclusive and equitable culture by improving our talent practices and evolving the recruiting model to access more diverse talent. We’re creating balance through our fair pay and global benefits programs.
Women’s representation in tech is a major, unsolved issue. want to work for a company with initiatives to help anyone who hasn’t been treated fairly in the workplace.
