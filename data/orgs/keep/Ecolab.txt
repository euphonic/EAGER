        What would Founder Osborn think of today? Its size and success would please him, its talented people would amaze him and its technologies would take his breath away. But some things would not surprise him, because he set them in motion. The fundamentals put in place – continuous innovation coupled with expert customer service – are still the foundation of Ecolab’s success.

Acquisitions have played a big part in Ecolab’s growth, bringing new capabilities and building presence in markets around the world. Divestitures have shaped the company too. See timelines for key acquisitions and divestitures.
Ecolab’s spirit of innovation traces back to its very first days, when founder Osborn mixed a few ingredients to make a rug cleaning compound, and seeing a need for a better soap for the new mechanical dishwashers, developed Soilax™, the company’s first successful product. Learn more about key innovations that followed over the years.
From the beginning, the focus was on “getting the job done.” To make sure the company’s products actually did the job, Osborn, and later his son E.B., made on-site service provided by trained representatives integral to the company’s offering. Explore how Ecolab’s commitment to expert customer service took shape.

In response, we developed EnCompass, a complete environmental hygiene program to eliminate healthcare-associated pathogens and ensure patient room hygiene. With proper staff training and monitoring, we can help you improve cleaning outcomes and reduce risk.
                        Nowhere is disinfection and the fight against germs more important than in hospitals and healthcare facilities.

Egyptian Fertilizers Company (EFC) is a leading global producer and distributor of high-quality nitrogen fertilizer products and industrial chemicals that provides clean, environmentally sound solutions to its customers. Its Suez plant is one of the largest fertilizer complexes in Egypt, producing 1,400 tons a day of ammonia and 5,000 tons a day of urea. It has four different recirculating cooling water systems designed to manage critical process operations.
One of the biggest challenges in open, recirculating cooling systems is a high risk of bacterial proliferation due to ammonia contamination and the high temperature of the cooling tower. This can lead to increased water, energy and chemical consumption as well as: 
Microbiologically induced corrosion
Loss of revenue
Nalco Water provided a comprehensive solution that included on-site expertise and 
Purate™ Technology
, a patented, proprietary chlorine dioxide program that controls biologic growth in cooling towers and other industrial water treatment applications. The treatment program has helped the plant reduce:
In addition, overall plant performance has improved, and safety has increased, due to the replacement of volatile chlorine gas with stable and reliable Purate biocide technology.
Purate is your best choice for ClO2. Advantages of Purate include:
Simple Two-Chemical Feed
Reliable and Easy to Operate
Best Total Cost of Operation
