         Find out the true story behind the development of the finest and most versatile laser light scattering instruments available, Technology's systems. Here you can trace the path of innovation and discovery in the field of light scattering from the middle of the 20th century to today's state-of-the-art instruments!
Brice Phoenix Universal Light Scattering Photometer
 was the first successful light scattering instrument. It used a mercury arc lamp as a light source and the sample was illuminated by placing it within a scattering cell in the light path. The cell sat on a stage and the detector could be revolved about this stage manually in order to attain light scattering measurements at varying angles. The detector consisted of a photomultiplier tube whose signal value was output to a galvanometer. The Brice Phoenix instrument was essential to early production of Zimm plots. This laboratory workhorse probably produced more Zimm plots in its time than any other instrument.
 instrument used a water cooled mercury vapor lamp as its light source. The measuring cell would be immersed in a liquid chosen to eliminate errors and simplify calculations, as well as providing efficient thermal control. The detector was a semi-automatic photomultiplier tube which could rotate through various angles.
 was the first commercially available light scattering instrument to incorporate a laser as its light source. detector was moved by a stepper motor through a 180° range, and the signal was output to a stepper driven X-chart or a strip chart. Produced by Science Spectrum, this instrument was primarily used in antibiotic testing. About 20 units in all were manufactured and sold.
Module was capable of levitating a single particle in the 100 to 4,000 nm range. The particle was levitated into the path of the laser beam by means of a quasi-static electric fields and could be maintained in this position for several days if needed. During the extended levitation period, time dependent physical phenomenon could be observed. The Differential Module was used to accurately measure liquid microdroplets and diverse viscous material.
                  Beckman Instruments developed an instrument for low angle laser light scattering capable of measuring the light scattering signal as low as 3°. The narrow beam of the laser allowed angles this low to be measured for the very first time. Chromatix further developed this instrument which was  marketed as the 
 for use with chromatographic separation systems. Chromatix was later purchased by Milton Roy, which was, in turn, purchased by Thermo Instruments.
 also used a laser as a light source. An automated carousel moved cuvettes through the beam path. The first cuvette would contain the control and successive cuvettes, having the bacterial isolate in suspension with selected antibodies, would then rotate into the beam path and their scattering properties could be measured. Data was recorded to an on-board computer and outputted to a card punch. The Differential was the first scientific instrument to incorporate both a laser and an on-board computer.
 differential refractometer made use of a 0.5 mHeNe laser as its light source. This instrument was very useful as it had the ability to measure differential refractive index increments (
 values) by passing laser light through a sample and control solution. This instrument also provided increased temperature control. However complex optics and manual mechanical adjustment mechanisms proved to be problematic.
 was a low angle light scattering instrument which made use of a HeNe laser as its light source. The instrument would detect light scattering signals between 5.1° and 6.1° using a fixed in place photomultiplier tube as the detector.
 instrument ever manufactured was purchased by Johnson Wax. HeNe laser was used as the light source and the flow cell was located very near the laser aperture. The flow cell ran perpendicular to the direction of the laser and was surrounded by a total of eight detectors.
 was sold to in 1984. It was the first instrument to have a flow through cell in which the direction of the flow is parallel to the beam direction. Like the DAWN-B, 15 separate photodiodes were housed in the read head to detect light scattering signals from the flowing solution. The flow cell, while similar in principle to our modern flow cells, differed greatly in appearance.
 (or DAWN-Batch) unit was an early model in the line. It housed 15 detectors which would simultaneously collect light scattering data scattered from a scintillation vial placed into the read head in the center of the array of detectors and the path of the HeNe laser.
 was developed and manufactured by the Tecator of Sweden. This differential refractive index detector was an essential partner to the series of instruments, as it was able to measure the 
 of a given solution at the same wavelength as the light scattering instrument. Knowing the 
 value is essential to the characterization of molar masses. The Tecator Optilab was purchased by and the instrument was further developed into the Optilab 903 model and ultimately into the Optilab DSP.
                  developed this three angle version of the instrument. The use of a solid state laser allowed the footprint of laser light scattering instrumentation to be reduced greatly. The 
 laser operates at 690 nm and the instrument is capable of measuring a molar mass range from a few hundred daltons to greater than one million daltons.  Molecular sizes may also be measured ranging from 10 to 50 nm.

The inventors of celebrate an early application of laser light scattering.
(WTC) is involved in the research and development of techniques, instrumentation and software for absolute macromolecular and nanoparticle characterization. Founded in 1982 by 
Dr. Philip , the company was formed around his patents, ideas and inventions in industrial, military, and medical domains and commercialized the first light scattering instrumentation using lasers. To date, has developed the following instruments: classical multi-angle light scattering detectors for determining absolute molecular weights and sizes of proteins, polymers, biopolymers and nanoparticles in solution, differential refractometers, differential viscometers, dynamic light scattering instruments, zeta potential instruments, composition-gradient apparatus, as well as field-flow fractionation separation systems and their software.
To a great extent, much of WTC's business began with the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts awarded to the firm for its outstanding technological prowess and potential. The contracts are administered by certain agencies of the Government who have set aside a fraction of their authorized R&funding for exclusive award to small businesses. The purpose of these highly competitive programs is to encourage scientific and technical innovation in areas deemed to be of national importance. The successful commercialization of products developed under these programs is one of the most important objectives of funding.
has been awarded contracts from the Army Bioengineering Medical Research & Development Laboratory to establish the feasibility of instrumentation for the detection of toxicants in drinking water within sixty minutes. Another contract was from the Army Armament, Munitions and Chemical Command to build an aerosol monitoring device for sub-micron particles. The potential applications for this instrument include real time identification of aerosol particles such as asbestos fibers and biological agents. Another major contract was awarded by the Office of Naval Research, to develop an 
 particle monitoring device for characterizing undersea environments and their particulate constituents.
By far, the company's commercial flagship instrument, the DAWN, has been the driving force of the company. With extensive emphasis placed on intellectual property and new, patentable developments, the and minisystems have been sold in increasing numbers for more than two decades. Instruments have been placed in thousands of laboratories throughout the world, making them the most widely-recognized light scattering products on earth. The utility of the instruments is underscored by the burgeoning bibliography of publications, most of which have appeared in refereed journals. The systems provide unique and powerful tools for many different areas of analytical chemistry, including quality control, process control, molecular weight and size determinations, and a host of other applications, which are all possible with these multi-angle light scattering detectors.
The detectors are used by the world's most prestigious universities and some of the largest corporations in the world including DuPont, Dow Chemical, IBM, GlaxoSmithKline, Procter & Gamble, Pfizer, Bayer, ExxonMobil and Merck. The company's applications have also involved sales to companies at the forefront of the bioarena including Amgen, Genentech, Biogen Idec, Genzyme, and MedImmune.

Thomas Scheuermann is the Senior Applications Scientist and Regional Manager for Technology, providing technical, application, and sales support for the Midwest. Thomas’ academic work concerned the structure, internal dynamics, and ligand binding properties of proteins, using biophysical tools such as spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, ITC, and light scattering. Highlights include structure determination of the chemotherapy drug metabolizing enzyme (mentors Michael Hodsdon and Elias Lolis, Yale University) and as a postdoctoral fellow (mentor Kevin Gardner, Southwestern Medical Center) identifying a druggable ligand binding site for the HIF-2a protein – a critical driver of some kidney and brain cancers. small molecule inhibitor identified in this project is under commercial development and is being evaluated in Phase Clinical trials.
These basic research efforts transitioned into application support roles with the Southwestern biophysics core facility and Healthcare, before joining the team in early 2018. Thomas strives to make the best match between technology, application, and scientist and enabling teams to better and more efficiently pursue their goals.
