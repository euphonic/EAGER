Hi, 
Hi, 
Start of a New Generation of Radios
Connectivity presents the next evolutionary step for radio technology in vehicles: the remote tuner module (RTM).
Connectivity presents the next evolutionary step for radio technology in vehicles: the remote tuner module (RTM). The concentrates central radio functions in one place at the rear of the vehicle. This simplifies the architecture of the entire antenna system considerably and minimises the number of head unit (HU) variants for automotive manufacturers.
The is available in different designs: for example, as an entry-level model for AM/or as a high-end remote tuner for AM/and Furthermore, regional variants are in the pipeline. The direct positioning of the close to the vehicle’s antennas improves reception quality, and no antenna amplifiers are required. The is connected to the head unit via a digital A2interface through which all audio and data flows are exchanged.
“From the perspective of automotive manufacturers, new communications technologies open up a whole world of complexity. Because what the customer wants has to be continually integrated into the vehicle with new functions. In the last few years, that was a significant driver of the proportion of components and with it the complexity and cost of infotainment systems,” said Thomas Falz, Vice President and General Manager, Wireless, Connectivity. “With its extraordinary concept, our remote tuner module is making a contribution to solving this dilemma and to a lasting reduction in system costs.”
Cost Savings Thanks to New System Architecture:
Relocating the radio from the head unit to the rear of the vehicle produces a number of benefits (see diagram). The new system architecture reduces the number of coaxial cables and connections and requires fewer antenna amplifiers—or even none at all, which reduces the assembly costs further. Simple APIs ensure additional savings on development costs. 
Simplified Handling of Variants:
Relocating the radio functions from the head unit to the antenna brings with it even more benefits. If the radio is located in the head unit, this increases the number of variants for automotive manufacturers (e.g. in Europe, in the USA). Without a radio, variant handling is simplified accordingly, while further traditional challenges such as heat, space and electromagnetic radiation can be solved more easily than they could previously. Positioning the close to the antenna reduces the transmission of analogue signals inside the vehicle and increases reception quality. 
Technical Features of the Remote Tuner Module:
Radio services supported: AM, FM, DAB, and Radio
A2digital interface for audio, data and firmware updates
Up to six separate tuners in the high-end variant, programmable phantom power supply

Transforming Logistics with IoThinking
Transforming Logistics with IoThinking
For Hanhaa Azhar Hussain, the goal was simple: Find a solution for easily tracking parcels anywhere in the world. For the shipping industry, this kind of solution is overdue. Each month, millions of dollars are lost because packages are lost or damaged during transit. After studying the causes closely, the London-based Hanhaa team partnered with Avnet and Connectivity to develop ParceLive, an IoT-enabled package-tracking device. As the team quickly learned, coming up with the right idea was only the beginning. Building it, testing it, and bringing it to market was altogether different, requiring the know-how of engineers versed in solving for Ioconnectivity. “helped us climb a wall before we even realized it was a wall,” says Azhar, adding “helped us refine the designs and tune the performance so that the tracker delivered the level of accuracy we needed.”

Learn how is helping Nikola Motor Company develop new technology for fully electric long-haul trucks. 
Engineering the Future of Travel
In 2015, the engineering community was challenged to invent prototype pods for the future of transportation – The Hyperloop. From the 1,200 teams that responded, just one, the rLoop team, was virtually crowdsourced becoming the only non-university team to advance to the final round of the competition.
Driving Business Relationships with IoT
The Internet of Things (IoT) is altering technology business relationships, with the greatest business opportunity of the 21st century.
Solving Tomorrow's Challenges
In our engineering laboratories worldwide, engineers partner with customers to develop durable, ruggedized, and rigorously-tested solutions. 
No one likes doing laundry, especially when you have to fight with your fraternity brothers over the washing machine. For college buddies Charlie Warden, Adam Miller, and Aaron Tate, they saw opportunity. Together, they co-founded Tersa Steam, a start-up that’s working to make clothing care efficient, sustainable, and easy. When Charlie (CEO), Adam (CMO), and Aaron (CPO) discovered TE, through the Arrow certification program, they quickly saw the value of working with a reputable and reliable engineering leader to solve their toughest design challenges.
The concern start-ups have with a big, global brand is getting lost. With TE, the communication is really strong – we’re able to call and ask questions. Plus, having a reliable source for parts that we know are going to work is extremely important.

Hi, 
Hi, 
New low profile flexible printed circuit (FPC) connectors save valuable space with one of the lowest profiles in the market
These connectors save valuable space with one of the lowest profiles in the market at 1mm. They also improve customer assembly efficiency by having the actuator open at delivery, enabling one finger operation.
Connectivity (TE), a world leader in connectivity and sensors, today announced its new low profile flexible printed circuit (FPC) connectors. These connectors save valuable space with one of the lowest profiles in the market at 1mm. They also improve customer assembly efficiency by having the actuator open at delivery, enabling one finger operation.
The .5mm back flip version has a dual contact design which allows the connector to mate with the cable in two orientations. This enables more design flexibility and saves time during both design and installation.

Hi, 
Twice the Density of 67 Modules
higher density coax module, twice the density of 67 modules used in embedded computing applications. Half and full size module sizes can retain up to 12 or 18+ contacts, with options for customizing contact count and position
Connectivity (TE), a world leader in connectivity and sensors, has released its new Nanomodules and contacts, which double the density of today’s 67 modules for embedded computing applications.
This high frequency nanominiature coax contact is engineered with smaller contacts and a higher contact density within a multi-position module. This design enables smaller packaging and saves valuable space. Half-size modules can support up to 12 contacts and full-size modules can support 18 contacts or higher, with the option to customize contact count and position. 
TE’s Nanomodules and contacts are also versatile. Their blind-mateable, float-mounted backplane contacts support module-to-module or box-to-box architecture. And, while they are designed for 0.047-inch coax cable, multiple cable types are available to fit the application’s needs. To bring high frequency capability into a high density modular package, the contacts are optimized for signal integrity and support frequencies up to 70 GHz.
The NanoRF’s design features a floating insert on the backplane side, with guide features to pre-align the array of contacts before they engage. This results in reliable mating and consistent performance up to 500 mating cycles.
“Nanooffers outstanding high frequency coax contact density in a rugged modular package, which is ideal for providing reliable performance in harsh environments,” said Mike Walmsley, global product manager for TE’s Aerospace, Defense and Marine division. “It has been tested to 72’s high vibration standards and is ready for open architecture under 67.3 — with a roadmap for expansion into other high-density packages.”

Hi, 
Hi, 
Easy-to-use poke-in connectors for smart home wall-mounted devices in WireMate range. Providing installation time-saving with poke-in termination versus screw style termination and simple lever design for release of one wire at a time.
Connectivity (TE), a world leader in connectivity and sensors, is introducing WireMate Two-Piece Poke-In connectors to provide designers with a three-directional mounting solution for wall-mounted devices. The product features a panel mounted, poke-in style terminal block and a mating blade-style header to be attached to the in the device. This two-piece combination allows for installation mounting to be “push-on” (into the wall), “slide-on” (along the wall), and “twist on” (rotating along the wall or ceiling). Applications such as thermostats and smoke detectors control panels, security system interfaces, access controls and environmental monitors, among others.
“The new WireMate connectors are easy to use, even for novice installers,” “The connectors are mounted on a wall plate, with the wires routed through an opening in the wall. The installer strips the wires of insulation and simply pokes them into the terminal block device, achieving a reliable termination without the use of a screwdriver or other tooling.”
There is a clear point of entry for wire insertion. Extracting the wires is just as easy, since an innovative lever design allows for the release of one wire at a time. flat connector surface is reserved for wire marking or color coding to create a simple and fast installation experience.
WireMate connectors are available between two and eight positions and with centerlines of 5mm or 8mm. They have a current rating of 5(18 wiring) or 3(20-24 AWG); all have a 250-voltage rating. Contacts are made in a tin-plated copper alloy. Headers are injection molded in a high temperature-resistant, flame retardant (UL94 V-0) liquid crystal plastic (LCP), and housings are in a thermoplastic polyester.

Hi, 
Hi, 
New solution eliminates the need for two separate connectors, supports multiple protocols
“TE’s new 124 position Sliver connectors and cable assemblies allow system designers to streamline their designs by combining two known solutions in the market  into one while supporting a variety of high-speed protocols,” says Lucas Benson, product manager at Connectivity. 
Connectivity (TE), a world leader in connectivity and sensors, today introduced its new 124 position Sliver internal I/connectors and cable assemblies, which provide a high density solution that enables up to x20 signal transmission lanes, or 40 differential pairs. The 124 position Sliver connectors currently support PCIe Gen 4 and Gen 5, Ethernet 56and SAS-5. The cable assemblies currently support PCIe Gen 4, with the ability to upgrade to PCIe Gen 5, Ethernet 56and SAS-5. The new 124 position solution can replace use of separate 50 and 74 position connectors, reducing the number of interconnections needed and enabling better cable management than was previously possible.
The  solution’s G-S-S-open pin field configuration  provides designers 20 lanes of  flexible  pin definitions. These products can also run x16 PCIe protocol plus extra side band signals or low power. In addition, TE’s 124 position Sliver connector and cable with integrated guide rail are more robust than other products in the market and are the only mid-board copper product with a pull tab on the plug and alignment features on the receptacle. This allows for blind mating and the ability to disengage the cable when there is  limited space for a finger to press  the latch button on the plug.
“TE’s new 124 position Sliver connectors and cable assemblies allow system designers to streamline their designs by combining two known solutions in the market  into one while supporting a variety of high-speed protocols,” says Lucas Benson, product manager at Connectivity. “These products simplify cable management and offer innovative mating capabilities that help to ensure positive connections and enhanced usability.”
