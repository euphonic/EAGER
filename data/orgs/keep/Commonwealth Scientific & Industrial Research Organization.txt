At CSIRO, we solve the greatest challenges using innovative science and technology.
Our value to the Australian economy is massive. Our proud legacy invented fast Wi-Fi, Aerogard and polymer banknotes. Today we’re helping to find the first gravitational waves in space, growing gluten-free grains, 3D-printing body parts and pioneering new renewable energy sources, just to name a few.
The estimated present value of benefits from our work is around $3.2 billion per year. This is almost three times our total annual budget and more than four times the funding provided by the Australian Government.
This year, we worked with 1750 private industry customers, including 400 major Australian companies, more than 1060 Australian small to medium enterprises (SMEs), and 280 overseas corporations. For example, our collaboration with Australian company Clinical Genomics enabled the delivery of a new blood test for bowel cancer (Colvera™), which is currently in clinical trials for use in Australia and the as a screening and early diagnostic test. As a blood test for cancer recurrence, Colvera™ was released in the market in 2016.
We've worked with Boeing over the past 28 years, collaborating on more than 170 projects covering everything from better production methods to space science, airport modelling software and how to best repaint a plane, to more recently including new manufacturing processes and ways to keep Boeing’s workers safe. This close relationship was a key factor in the aviation company’s decision to set up one of its largest and development facilities in Australia. Boeing now has around 3000 Australian employees. Local industry has also reaped the benefits with more than $336 million in Boeing related exports. In 2017, we were named a Boeing ‘Supplier of the Year’ in the technology category.
With more than 1800 patents, we are Australia’s largest patent holder. This ever-increasing wealth of intellectual property is a vast source of commercial opportunity and has already resulted in more than 150 spin-off companies, with many more to come.
For around a century we have been pushing the boundaries of what is possible in science and technology. But it’s tomorrow’s innovations that excite us – wearable technology that alerts a doctor when you are sick, diets based on your and so much more.
We've established six new Future Science Platforms as an investment in science to underpin innovation. The Future Science Platforms are designed to provide researchers with resources and opportunities to explore new areas. These have the potential to reinvent and create new industries for Australia by developing new capability in leading-edge, interdisciplinary science.

Future Science Platforms are critical to turn Australia’s future challenges into opportunities to invent a better future for us all.
Future Science Platforms (FSPs) are an investment in science that underpins innovation and that has the potential to help reinvent and create new industries for Australia. FSPs will see us grow the capability of new generation of researchers and allow Australia to attract the best students and experts to work with us on future science.
Here's a short summary of the visions behind each of our new Future Science Platforms: a multi-year, multi-disciplinary investment in our collective future - bringing and our partners together to work on the big ideas.
harnesses digital technology, autonomous systems, and materials science to deliver the transdisciplinary breakthroughs needed for Enlightened Industry, or Industry 5.0. It helps industry tackle global challenges and take advantage of future trends.
uses expertise in materials, robotics, processing and sensing technologies and autonomous science to bridge the gap between improving what’s currently possible and paving the way for what soon will be.
Active Integrated Matter - Researching the material things that interact with the digital world
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning will target AI-driven solutions for areas including food security and quality, health and wellbeing, sustainable energy and resources, resilient and valuable environments, and Australian and regional security.
An example of the work being considered by the AI/is harnessing genome and climate data to predict and enhance crop and livestock performance in complex agricultural systems; or using real-time data streams to improve the accuracy of forecasting across the energy system.
acts as a network and partner with government, industry and universities, to advance the technologies of in many areas of society and industry. Central to the wider deployment of these advanced technologies is trust, and much of our work is motivated by maximising the trustworthiness of these new technologies. From emergency detection to better management of a city's infrastructure – we're working with our partners to solve today's problems, and build a safer and more efficient future for the next generation.
In the future, Australia's minerals, energy and water resources will come from far greater depths in the Earth and from deep offshore sources, but our ability to find and exploit these resources is limited by the deep and complex cover of sediments and weathered material that covers 80 per cent of Australia's land mass. The science of Deep Earth Imaging will help us more precisely image subsurface rock properties to unlock the potential of this vast and relatively under-explored area.
Digiscape is about harnessing the digital revolution for Australian farmers and land managers. We will solve multiple real-life knowledge shortfalls in the land sector simultaneously by building a common big data infrastructure that will support next generation decision making and transform agricultural industries and environmental action.
Environomics aims to reinvent how we measure and monitor ecosystem health, predict biodiversity responses to environmental change, manage biological resources, detect biosecurity threats and more. This next generation of environmental science will be based on genomics, phenomics, big data informatics and simulation.
Australia has access to vast energy resources through sun, wind, biomass, natural gas and coal, all of which can be used to produce hydrogen and/or the desired energy carrier compound. The fuel could be used domestically in transport, power generation and to offset more carbon-intensive resources, and Australia could also become a world-leading exporter of low emissions hydrogen.
Australia's current healthcare system is focussed on treating illnesses, but to keep up with our ageing population the focus needs to switch to keeping healthy people healthy. Through engagement with the community to understand their expectations and attitudes to a more tailored healthcare paradigm, and building on programs and developments already underway in the medical field, Precision Health will focus on creating an integrated platform that can be used to proactively manage a person's health throughout the course of their life through highly tailored food, nutrition and lifestyle interventions.
revolution in healthcare through devices and systems to obtain real-time information from living organisms about their health and well-being. This will lead to the ability to provide health and medical interventions that are timely, customised and highly specific. Innovative autonomous sensing technology also strengthen future biosecurity control for the nation.
Space Technology will identify and develop the science to leapfrog traditional technologies and find new areas for Australian industry to work in. It will initially focus on advanced technologies for Earth observation, and then address challenges such as space object tracking, resource utilisation in space, and developing manufacturing and life support systems for missions to the Moon and Mars.
An example of the work being considered by the Space is the challenge presented by the significant volumes of Earth observation data being gathered by a new generation of small satellites. This creates opportunities to build new businesses and reinvent numerous fields of research, driven by new insights into our environment. Our multi-disciplinary approach can also be applied to the challenges of resource extraction while in space, remote operations, space object tracking, and astronaut health and nutrition.
Over the past 75 years, has built strong capabilities in Earth observation, radio astronomy, space tracking and managing complex facilities. supports supply chains through advanced manufacturing, managing big data and helping small and medium enterprises (SMEs). also has an established network of national and international partnerships throughout the space sector, and recently released our Space Roadmap .

The Scheme is available to ‘Public Officials’ to make public interest disclosures.
From 15 January 2014, the Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013 (Cth) (Act) gives a right to Public Officials to disclose information about suspected wrongdoing in and other parts of the public sector.
The Act aims to promote integrity and accountability in the Australian public sector – including – by encouraging the disclosure of information about suspected wrongdoing, protecting people who make disclosures and requiring agencies to take action.
For information on the Australian Government’s approach to Public interest Disclosure and a copy of the Act go to the Ombudsman .
The Act provides a legislative basis for the Public Interest Disclosure (PID) Scheme and associated protections. The following is a summary of the Scheme.
The Scheme is only available to ‘Public Officials’. It is not open to the general public.
current and former staff of contracted and subcontracted service providers to CSIRO, ie:
individuals who are contracted or subcontracted to provide goods or services to when they are entering into or carrying out the contract or subcontract
officers and employees of companies that are contracted or subcontracted to provide goods or services to when the officers and employees are entering into or carrying out the contract or subcontract.
For some affiliates, a Authorised Internal Recipient will need to make a determination that they are a ‘Public Official’ to qualify under the Scheme.
a Public Official, in connection with his or her position as a Public Official; or
a contracted service provider for a (including CSIRO) contract, in connection with entering into, or giving effect to, that contract may disclose or report such information to a Authorised Internal Recipient.
The types of ‘disclosable conduct’ under the Act include conduct which:
is an abuse of public trust or position
is maladministration, including conduct that is unjust, oppressive or negligent

The following is not disclosable conduct:
judicial conduct and the proper conduct of intelligence agencies
Public interest disclosures by Public Officials may be made in writing or orally.
the Ombudsman or, for security and intelligence matters, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security — if you believe on reasonable grounds it is appropriate to do so in the circumstances.
People working in may also make disclosures to their Supervisor.
Public interest disclosures may be made in writing by mail or email to, or by making an appointment for a confidential telephone call with a Authorised Internal Recipient.
When disclosing, be clear and factual and avoid speculation, personal attacks and emotive language as these can divert attention from the real issues.
the nature of the disclosable conduct
who you think committed the disclosable conduct
when and where the disclosable conduct occurred
if you did anything in response to the disclosable conduct
others who know about the disclosable conduct and may have allowed it to continue
names of any people who witnessed what happened or who may be able to verify what you are saying
if you are concerned about possible reprisals as a result of making the disclosure
information (such as supporting correspondence or other documents including file notes or a diary of events) you have to support the disclosure.
Public Officials may provide a disclosure anonymously, however this will reduce an investigator’s ability to investigate the matter, and the outcomes of the disclosure or investigation may not be able to be reported back to the discloser.
If you advise that you wish to remain anonymous, the Authorised Internal Recipient will take care to keep your contact details and identifying information confidential.
Everyone should recognise however that even if the staff involved in handling a disclosure take the utmost care to protect the discloser’s identity, they may not be able to prevent the person’s identity from becoming known or deduced.
If you make a disclosure, the Act provides certain protections from reprisals. Your identity will be treated confidentially and identifying information will only be used for the purposes of the Act (including the investigation) unless you consent to some additional use.
All disclosures will be handled in a confidential manner.
What you can expect from us
You can seek assistance from an Authorised Internal Recipient if you need help making a public interest disclosure.
Within 14 days after you make a disclosure, a Authorised Internal Recipient will tell you (provided you are contactable) either:
the reasons why your disclosure has not been allocated to or another agency for further action.
If your disclosure is allocated to to handle, CSIRO’s Investigator will advise you either that:
the disclosed conduct will be investigated and the estimated time the investigation will take (investigations must be completed within 90 days unless the Ombudsman grants an extension), or
the disclosed conduct will not be investigated giving reasons and suggesting other courses of action that might be available.
The investigation, if any, will be conducted in accordance with the Act. You may be contacted if the Investigator requires more information and you will be provided with a copy of the investigation report (after confidential and privacy-related information has been redacted).
If you are dissatisfied with the handling of your disclosure
You may make a complaint to the Ombudsman under the Ombudsman Act 1976 about a decision not to allocate or investigate your disclosure or about the way that your disclosure has been handled or investigated.
You may also make an external public interest disclosure to anyone if you have first made an internal disclosure (e.g. through the Scheme) provided that it is not contrary to the public interest to do so and either:
you reasonably believe that the investigation or its outcome was inadequate.
You may also make an emergency disclosure if you reasonably believe there is a substantial and imminent danger to health, safety or the environment.
Go to Ombudsman for further information before making an external or emergency disclosure as specific conditions apply.
Other agencies who propose to allocate a public interest disclosure to should first contact a Authorised Internal Recipient at PIDdisclosures@csiro.au .
Go to Ombudsman for a copy of the Act and information sheets and guides.

response to Code of Conduct breach 
CSIRO, Australia's national science agency, will partner with Fortescue Metals Group (Fortescue) on hydrogen technologies to support the development of new industries, create jobs and pave the way for low emissions export opportunities
The centrepiece of the $20m partnership, announced today at CSIRO's Brisbane laboratories, is an investment in CSIRO's metal membrane technology, which enables ammonia to be used as a carrier material for hydrogen storage and transport.
Chief Executive Dr Larry Marshall said: "has a strong history of collaboration with industry, not just helping existing industries reinvent themselves through global disruption, but actually inventing entirely new industries like hydrogen where Australia can take the lead."
"Today we're seeing a 'market pull' from companies like Fortescue to reinvent themselves through deep science-driven innovation and follow the global market shift towards a low-emissions energy future, and in so doing create a whole new export market for our vast clean energy resources."
"This partnership is great news for Australia, not just through new industry creation and the jobs that will flow from it, but in contributing to a different energy future that is secure, affordable, and sustainable," Dr Marshall said.
will work with Fortescue to identify, develop and commercialise technologies to support the creation of an Australian hydrogen industry and future global uptake.
The agreement includes commercialisation arrangements for the membrane technology, with a subsequent five-year investment in hydrogen R&D.
CSIRO's National Hydrogen Roadmap, released earlier this year, provided a coordinated blueprint for growing Australia's hydrogen industry and found that an economically-sustainable hydrogen industry could soon be a reality.
Fortescue Chairman Andrew Forrest said: "We are at the beginning of an energy revolution and Fortescue intends to be at the forefront of this once in a generation opportunity."
"As a proud Australian company, we are excited to partner with CSIRO, our nation's preeminent science and body, to unlock the potential of hydrogen, the low emission fuel of the future," Mr Forrest said.
will continue its own investment in hydrogen R&D, chiefly through its Hydrogen Energy Systems Future Science Platform (FSP), and will work with Fortescue to commercialise technologies that support new energy markets, including in the chemicals and transportation sectors.
Both and Fortescue recognise that a hydrogen industry will require a collaborative approach, and that many opportunities for partnership will emerge as technologies and markets develop.
