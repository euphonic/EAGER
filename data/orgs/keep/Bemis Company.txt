Our Packaging Helps Our Customers and Consumers Win, Protects Products and Reduces Food Waste
We spark technology breakthroughs through bold thinking, deep customer engagement and insight. We are committed to high quality execution and technical support that provides peace of mind.
We Help Reduce Food Waste
According to the United Nations Environment Program up to 30% of food produced globally goes to waste. Studies by the Council for Packaging and the environment show that packaging only accounts for 7-10 percent of the total environmental impact of a product. By delivering packaging that preserves freshness and minimizes food waste, we’re truly part of the solution.
Our packaging provides moisture and oxygen barrier that reduces spoilage, helps keep bacteria at bay and maximizes product freshness. For medical and pharmaceutical applications, our packaging ensures sterility where required.
We Make Consumers Lives Easier
Packaging that allows for portioning, easier opening, reclose, or even cuts down the time spent on prepping in the kitchen makes consumers’ lives easier, every day.

Our Commitment
We take our responsibility to the environment seriously. That’s why we’ve designed programs and initiatives to help meet our own and our customers’ environmental goals.
Good environmental practices are woven into every part of our operating model, and we continue to make tremendous progress toward our environmental sustainability goals.

Given the meaningful progress in our goals, we are now simplifying our approach and extending our progress for the long term by adopting a “maintain and gain” philosophy.
We aim to hold the progress (maintain) and look for opportunities to continually improve even further (gain) as we grow our business.
We are proud of our accomplishments, but we will never stop our continuous improvement philosophy.
