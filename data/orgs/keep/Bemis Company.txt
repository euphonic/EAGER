Our Packaging Helps Our Customers and Consumers Win, Protects Products and Reduces Food Waste
We spark technology breakthroughs through bold thinking, deep customer engagement and insight. We are committed to high quality execution and technical support that provides peace of mind.
We Help Reduce Food Waste
According to the United Nations Environment Program up to 30% of food produced globally goes to waste. Studies by the Council for Packaging and the environment show that packaging only accounts for 7-10 percent of the total environmental impact of a product. By delivering packaging that preserves freshness and minimizes food waste, we’re truly part of the solution.
Our packaging provides moisture and oxygen barrier that reduces spoilage, helps keep bacteria at bay and maximizes product freshness. For medical and pharmaceutical applications, our packaging ensures sterility where required.
Packaging that allows for portioning, easier opening, reclose, or even cuts down the time spent on prepping in the kitchen makes consumers’ lives easier, every day.
