Please join Electrix, in welcoming Dwight Kitchen as our new team leader, taking on the position of President and General Manager effective immediately. He will have responsibility for all business development and operations, reporting to Chief Executive Officer, Cory Meyer.
Dwight will be leading the company to build on Electrix's strong reputation for high quality, innovative lighting and architectural solutions.

Dwight has a proven 30-year track record with Osram Sylvania, serving most recently as the Vice President and General Manager for Traxon e:cue North America. Prior, Dwight was the Regional Luminaires for Osram Sylvania, starting up a luminaire business that grew substantially in three years by introducing "open innovation" with partners to accelerate development, extending the business to South America, and developing partnerships with peer market leaders. Along the way the new portfolio received numerous accolades including: Design Journal's Gold & Platinum Awards for Design Excellence; Lighting for Tomorrow Design Award; and Next Generation Luminaires Design Competition Award.
Dwight was instrumental in several transformations at Osram Sylvania through a distinguished career with key roles in sales, marketing, and engineering, first managing the technology shift from traditional lighting product to solid state components and then into an integrated solid state solutions provider.
Mark Lahner, will serve as the Executive Vice President for Business Development focusing on strategic relationships, industry alignment and collaboration opportunities.

For MetLife, consolidating their 1,500 New York employees to one location was a chance to redefine the insurance company’s workplace and reinvigorate the staff. Part of this process included redesigning the interior of the MetLife building which you can see in our gallery.
For Electrix, this was an
opportunity for us to push the capability of the K8 Knife Edge Cove Framing System.
We customized our standard 8” knife edge system with radius corners. Our K8-L
