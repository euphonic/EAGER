In 1885, long before anyone talks about carbon footprints or climate change, Warren launches a to explore new ways to harness and conserve precious energy resources. In doing so, he also launches a tradition of customer-focused innovation—a tradition that has inspired thousands of employees for more than 130 years and that continues to drive the success of Controls. Even before he founds the firm now known as Controls, Warren is the quintessential inventor. His pneumatic tower clocks, electric storage batteries, wireless telegraph business and steam-powered luxury cars and postal service trucks anticipate—and shape—the future.
Warren partners with Milwaukee businessman and financier William Plankinton to form the Electric Service Company. serves as vice president and treasurer, and Plankinton as president. Installations at the Milwaukee Public Library and city hall help the business grow quickly.
In the age of Edison, Bell, Daimler, Pasteur, Tesla and Ericsson, anything seems possible. It’s an era of firsts: electric lights, internal combustion engines, X-rays and hydroelectric power plants.
Against this backdrop, Warren toils for three years to invent a device to regulate room temperature. In 1883, he receives his first patent for what will be known as the electric room thermostat—an invention that launches an industry and changes how people live. Within two years, his quickly growing Electric Service brings evenly regulated temperatures to buildings around the world.
Warren and associates patent steam valves, steam traps, pressure reduction valves, water heaters, hydraulic air compressors and electric meters in developing the first automatic zone temperature control system. century later, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers calls it  “the grandfather of all control systems.”
McClure’s magazine ad promises “domestic harmony and budget savings” with the Electric Service Furnace Draft Regulator.
William Plankinton retires and Warren becomes president. Johnson’s drive for innovation leads to patents for an “auto-carriage” steam generator and a forerunner of power steering. Over the next 11 years, Electric Service makes 1,000 steam-powered cars, fire trucks, limousines and ambulances.
With installations worldwide—including the Capitol, the New York Stock Exchange, a Warsaw factory and a palace in Tokyo—Electric Service changes its name to Service and moves to the downtown Milwaukee site that is now headquarters for Building Efficiency.
Service introduces a line of gasoline cars featuring luxurious leather and wood interiors.
The first skyscraper, Singer Sewing Machine’s New York City headquarters, has “every approved modern device for comfort, convenience and safety,” including 1,200 Service room thermostats. Future York International’s refrigeration system delivers “a continuous supply of cold drinking water.”
Comfort Catches On
Construction booms. The elevator sends buildings to new heights—and multi-zone temperature make them comfortable places to work.
Harry Ellis becomes president when Warren passes away in 1911. Ellis sells the automotive and pneumatic clock businesses. Like Johnson, though, he emphasizes efficient manufacturing and dedicated customer service, insisting that only technicians install Service building control systems.
World War takes a bite out of civilian construction, but the company’s innovative products become money-saving necessities during the Great Depression.
Globe Electric Company, a future business, begins making electrical equipment for streetcars and street lights, and soon adds automotive battery production.
15-cent postage stamp acknowledges the country’s transition to the horseless carriage, depicting a postal delivery truck made by Service Company.
Future business Hoover Steel Ball opens to serve the precision bearing and automotive industries. Years later, it expands into automotive seating.
Civilian construction slows during World War I, and Service becomes ineligible for military procurement when the government categorizes its products as luxuries. The continues to thrive, though, by retrofitting old buildings with temperature controls.
As a new decade dawns, a war-weary public seeks out entertainment. Motion pictures are all the rage, and Service gets into the act with a product that helps make movie houses a haven of comfort: for air conditioning.
The Service Company’s pneumatic system for temperature and humidity control promises fuel savings of up to 35 percent.
Service buys the patent for a dual thermostat developed by the chief custodian of the New York City schools (and a Service customer). The device lowers temperatures automatically by sensing increasing air pressure when occupants leave a room and reduces fuel consumption—a boon during the Great Depression.
Many companies cut costs when the stock market crashes, but Service Company’s sales remain strong for years due to a backlog of orders—and a rising demand for the dual thermostat, which automatically cuts fuel consumption when spaces are unoccupied.
worsening economy forces Service to lay off workers, reduce salaries and move sales offices to salesmen’s homes. With construction stagnant, the focuses on retrofitting older buildings with the Duo-Stat, which saves fuel by adjusting indoor temperature as outdoor conditions change.
As the Depression grinds on, government employment programs generate construction projects for private and public buildings that need temperature regulation systems. When war breaks out again, the government classifies Service Company’s products as essential.
The war’s end unleashes demand for new buildings with modern features like air conditioning. Service responds by developing a pneumatic control center for controlling temperature from one location. Emphasis shifts from individual room to “zone control systems.”
Joseph Cutler, who started with Service as a sales engineer in 1912, becomes president. Over the next 22 years, he reorganizes the sales force and adds 79 branch offices, and sales grow from $3 million in 1939 to $67.3 million in 1960.
Service goes public, listing its securities over the counter.
The government classifies building as essential to the war effort because they improve worker efficiency in defense plants and save fuel needed in combat zones. Service equips military training facilities and defense plants with temperature and humidity control systems.
With the war’s end, new construction increases, as does demand for skilled workers. Service launches its first formal technical training program in New York. The Technical Institute offers the equivalent of two free years of college to employees who complete night classes or correspondence courses.
The new United Nations building in New York City epitomizes a fresh generation of construction. Fully air-conditioned, it requires 3,600 Service thermostats and ancillary controls.
Eli Lilly & rushes researcher Jonas Salk’s polio vaccine into mass production at its Indianapolis, Indiana, plant. Service installs critical temperature-regulating apparatus in rooms where the virus is grown.
Business booms for Service as control systems grow more complex. The numbers of employees, branches and installations hit all-time highs, thanks to demand for pneumatic control centers that let one person monitor an entire building’s room and water temperatures and ventilation from one location.
Service Company’s sales surpass US$1 billion after merging with Penn Controls. The renamed expands its technological capabilities through acquisitions, starting with Globe-Union, the largest manufacturer of automotive batteries. By adding seating and plastics machinery firm Hoover Universal and seating supplier Ferro Manufacturing, can design, engineer and assemble complete automotive seating systems.

Globe-Union teams up with Disney to market "Mickey Mouse" roller skates
January 16, 1957
The Jan. 16, 1957 issue of the Milwaukee Sentinel announced that Globe-Union and Disney were teaming up to sell roller skates.  In the previous year, Globe had applied for and received (over two other roller skate manufacturers) a license to use the Mickey Mouse and Mouseketeer names on a line of roller skates.  The partnership marked Globe-Union's entrance into the franchised merchandise field.  "Mickey Mouse" skates were designed for beginners, and "Mouseketeer" skates were aimed at older children.  Both of the new skate brands were introduced at the New York Toy Fair in March 1957.  The skates led to a 30% increase in Globe-Union's roller skate sales in 1957.  Despite healthy sales, Globe ultimately sold its roller skate operations to the Aluminum Specialty of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, in 1965.  Globe management had decided by then that roller skates no longer fit with the company's other product lines, including batteries and electronics.  Globe-Union was acquired by in 1978.
Wanvig, the first president of Globe-Union, is born
On December 7, 1890, Chester Odin Wanvig, the first president of Globe-Union (the ancestor to Controls' Power Solutions Business Unit), was born in Milwaukee.  Chester's father was John Wanvig, a Norwegian immigrant who was widely known as a master of ships which plied the Great Lakes.  As a boy, Chester worked his way up from deckhand to wheelsman on his father's coal and ore ship, and also sold newspapers.  He went on to attend the Michigan College of Mines at Houghton for a time, but left to clerk at a steel company.  At the age of 20, Chester became general manager and secretary of the Wallace Smith Co., then the nation's largest manufacturer of saddlery.  After gaining financial control of the company, he liquidated it in the early 1920s and subsequently purchased (with his brother) the Globe Electric Company.  Globe's 1925 purchase of Central Radio Laboratories (later known as Centralab) proved fortuitous in that it immediately preceded the radio craze that would sweep America.  Also, about this time, Wanvig formed Union Battery to serve as a supplier to Sears.  In 1929, the assets of Globe Electric and Union Battery were consolidated and the Globe-Union Manufacturing was organized.  Automotive batteries came to represent Globe's major success, much of which was owed to Globe's engineers and their patented equipment and processes.  Under Wanvig, growth continued apace, with sales of batteries, Centralab electronic components, roller skates, and spark plugs reaching $50 million by 1955.  Wanvig was president of Globe-Union until 1949, chairman of the board from 1949 to 1953, and from 1954 to 1958 he served as both board chairman and president.  Upon Wanvig's retirement in 1958, his son, Chester Wanvig, Jr., became president of Globe-Union.  Wanvig, Jr. was still at the helm of Globe-Union in 1978 when it was acquired by Controls.
On November 6, 1847, Warren Seymour Johnson, the founder of Controls, was born to Charles and Emeline in Leicester, Vermont.  Two years later, the family boarded a sailing vessel in Buffalo, New York, bound for Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  The family settled first in Waukesha and, later, to homesteads in central and northern Wisconsin.  By some accounts, had a harsh childhood, marked by the death of his mother in 1855.  He received little formal schooling, but acquired a self-taught education from books, observation, and experimentation.  In a precursor to his later career as an inventor, kept a book in which he sketched and described a number of inventions in the fields of chemistry, electricity, and mechanics.  As a young man, worked on his father's farm and in the lumber mills of northern Wisconsin.  He also learned the printer's trade and, at the age of 17, secured the position of foreman in the office of the Lean Wolf, a Durand, Wisconsin, newspaper.  In the next 10 years of his life, worked as a surveyor and school teacher.  Eventually, he became the Superintendent of Schools for New Lisbon, Wisconsin in 1874.  In 1877, took a position as a professor of mathematics, sciences and drawing at the State Normal School in Whitewater, Wisconsin.  During his teaching tenure there, he came up with his idea for regulating temperature in buildings through the use of thermostats - an idea upon which he founded this in 1885.
Upon conclusion of the Service (Controls' former name) board meeting on Oct. 20, 1902, the directors decided to inspect the construction of the company's new headquarters being built on the southeast corner of Jefferson and Michigan streets in downtown Milwaukee.  Of particular interest to them was the selection of exterior brick.  Their first choice of brick had not yet come in after two months' wait, so the board took action.  According to the minutes, " ... after inspecting several different kinds, a light shade of red pressed brick submitted by Rickertson & Schwarz was selected, the price to be $15 dollars per thousand."  Subsequent buildings erected around the original headquarters are of the same color brick, making the an easily recognizable presence in today's downtown Milwaukee - not bad for a brick that came in second place.
On Sept. 5, 1958, Globe-Union, Inc. (predecessor to today's Power Solutions group) produced its 50 millionth battery for Sears, Roebuck & Co. Then Sears President Charles Kellstadt and other Sears officers were present when the 50 millionth battery (bearing a special coat of gold paint) was taken from the production line at Globe's Milwaukee manufacturing plant. After photo ops, the commemorative battery (accompanied by Miss Milwaukee of 1958, Carmen Shields) was transported in an antique automobile to Milwaukee's Mitchell Field.  From there it was flown to Detroit (the "Motor City"), where it was to be placed on permanent display at a Sears store.  Globe began making automotive batteries for Sears in 1927 - today, Power Solutions continues to supply batteries to Sears. Pictured from left, Shields, Kellstadt and Globe-Union president Wanvig, Sr., as they admire the 50 millionth battery.
Service and York help put man on the moon
On Aug. 15, 1965, the trade journal Contractor announced "Moonport Takes 10,000-Ton Air Conditioning System."  The "moonport" referred to in the article was the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) under construction at the Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island, Florida (shown in ad from 1965).  The was built to vertically assemble the stages of the Saturn rocket for the Apollo program, the project that eventually landed the first man on the surface of the moon in July 1969.  At the time, this was the largest building in the world by volume at 129 million cubic feet (for comparison, the Pentagon is 77 million cubic feet in volume).  The 525 foot high, single-story structure's interior was so large, in fact, that it was feared that rain clouds might form at the top of it without proper environmental control.  Service Co. (Controls' former name) and York were involved in overcoming the unique challenges posed in providing the proper climate needed for precision assembly of several-stories-high rockets.  York supplied the four 2,500-ton "Turbomaster" water chilling units at the heart of the building's air conditioning system, while installed the pneumatic climate controls.  Until recently, the was used for the preparation of the Space Shuttle for launch; in the future, the will be used to prepare commercial launch vehicles, and for NASA's new Space Launch System.
On July 29, 1896, the York Manufacturing Co. (York) completed construction of its new plant in York, Pennsylvania.  York, founded in 1874 and acquired by in 2005, had originally occupied a two-story building on Penn Street in downtown York.  Its first products were washing machines, turbine water wheels, corn planters and cultivators, and shaft pulleys and hangers.  However, most of the company's early revenue came from machine repairs - not equipment sales.  By 1885, the young had entered the field of ice and refrigerating machines, which after some initial tough times, would prove where the would find success.  In 1893, the purchased land and buildings in west York near the Northern Central Railway in order to expand and modernize its factory production.  After receiving architect Dempwolf's plant designs, president Phillip Glatfelter realized that the had insufficient capital to carry them through to completion.  In order to raise the necessary funds to construct the factory, Glatfelter decided to incorporate the in 1895.  Work on the new plant was begun on July 13, 1895.  However, the expense of the new plant and equipment, along with lagging sales, and a severe national economic depression, caused another financial crisis for the in 1896 - which was only resolved with the hiring of Thomas Shipley to manage the in 1897.  Shipley, who had built his reputation in the refrigeration machine business at the Frick Company, instituted a number of changes that soon put York on the path to becoming an industry leader.
On June 21, 1939, Olav, the crown prince of Norway, visited Globe-Union, Inc.'s (the predecessor of today's Power Solutions business unit) Milwaukee battery manufacturing facilities during his tour.  Prince Olav came at the invitation of Globe president Chester Wanvig, himself a proud Norwegian-American who had donated generously to charitable causes in Norway.  And whatever became of Olav?  Well, it took almost 20 years from the time of his Milwaukee visit for the man who would be king to actually become king (in 1957), a role that he served until his death in 1991 at the age of 87.  Nicknamed the "People's King," his passing prompted a great outpouring of grief by the Norwegian people, who lit hundreds of thousands of candles in memoriam in the courtyard outside the Royal Castle in Oslo. (Norway's Prince Olav and Princess Martha are pictured attending a concert in Milwaukee during their June 1939 visit.)
The first board meeting of the Electric Service (Controls' original name) took place in the office of Milwaukee financier William Plankinton in the Plankinton Hotel on Friday, May 1, 1885.  The incorporators and original stockholders were Plankinton, who was named president; Warren Johnson, who was named vice president and treasurer (while would serve as day-to-day manager, he would not be named president until 1901); and Captain Irving Bean, who was named secretary.  They had filed incorporation papers several days earlier, on April 20.  The charter was to "manufacture, sell, and deal in electric and pneumatic apparatus, and to construct and apply the same to public and private buildings in order to regulate temperature ... ."  At the meeting, assigned his patents to the and agreed to assign all future patents in the field of temperature regulation to the as well.  As to finances, the capital stock of the was $150,000 - 3,000 shares at $50 each.  Plankinton contributed the total capital amount of $150,000, for which he received joint ownership in Warren Johnson's patents and 1,499 shares.  also received 1,499 shares, with the remaining two shares going to Irving Bean.
Michael Žantovský, the Czech Republic's ambassador to the United States (pictured, left), discussed his country's future with management during a visit to Milwaukee, Wis. on April 17, 1996.  Žantovský stressed his country's stability, stating "we have the most stable environment of all the post-communist countries.  There has been extensive privatization, coupled with a relaxation of trade and economic regulations.  Our currency is strong, the economy is growing steadily and there is a solid influx of foreign investment."  James Keyes, Controls' and chairman at that time (pictured on the right), agreed with Žantovský's comments and promised to expand the company's presence there.
An article about system installations in airports in the and abroad was featured in the March 29, 1983 edition of "Briefing," a newsletter for managers.  One such installation was at Heathrow - London's well-known airport.  Systems Limited used an 8001 (see photo) building automation system for the Heathrow project.  Earlier in 1983, had been awarded a full systems and services contract for work on the 1984 Olympics-related expansion of the Los Angeles International Airport.  Other airport projects at that time included those in Zürich, Switzerland; Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; Frankfurt and Düsseldorf, West Germany; and the Schiphol airport in Amsterdam.
"Recessions bring good business for Globe-Union, Inc., in roller skates …" states the caption for this photograph published in the Milwaukee News-Sentinel from Feb. 20, 1938.  According to Globe (which was acquired by in 1978), roller skate sales increased in hard economic times (this was the Great Depression era) as families sought more inexpensive forms of recreation.  Globe began manufacturing roller skates in 1931 at its Milwaukee plant (where this photograph was taken) as a means to maintain employment of workers subject to seasonal lay-offs in its other divisions.
By the early 1950s, the had become one of the nation's top three makers of roller skates.  Production eventually moved to a new suburban Milwaukee facility in 1962.  Three years later (1965), Globe sold its roller skate manufacturing operations to the Aluminum Specialty of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, indicating at the time that roller skate manufacturing no longer fit with its other product lines (e. g., batteries).View Our Brands
