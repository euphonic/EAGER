More Than a CEO, Bill Buckner Is an Ag Advocate, a ‘Great Friend’
Bill Buckner As Modern Agriculture Advocate
Bill Buckner Prepares for Next Season of Serving AgricultureWe are scientists, consultants, collaborators, plant breeders, greenhouse assistants, agricultural economists, forage agronomists, beef producers, soils and crops specialists, wildlife biologists, biochemists, mycologists, genomicists, community members, teachers, life-long learners.
Nearly 400 of us come together from 20-plus countries to work at Research Institute headquarters in Ardmore, Oklahoma, and research farms in surrounding area, to carry out vision of Lloyd Noble.
Just like Noble, we hold a deep appreciation for agriculture and people who produce our food. We combine our various backgrounds and expertise to find solutions to problems faced by farmers and ranchers. This, we believe, will produce lasting benefits for all mankind and natural resources upon which we depend.
Our activities are organized into four interconnected areas:
We focus on research that will help farmers and ranchers improve land stewardship and productivity regionally, nationally and internationally. Our approach considers all spectrums of agricultural research, including basic, translational and applied. We study basic molecular and genetic levels of how plants grow and interact with microbial world around them, develop stronger plants more tolerant to drought and resistant against diseases and pests, and evaluate how well cattle perform in various grazing systems.
We keep heart of agriculture – its farmers, ranchers and other land stewards – at forefront of our activities. They are our friends and neighbors, and we help them meet their goals through one-on-one, no-cost consultation. These relationships keep us connected to real-life producer needs so research remains focused on answering relevant, pressing questions. We also provide leadership and training for other agricultural organizations so that together we can better serve agriculture.
Applied Agricultural Systems Research and Technology
We are producers, too. We live out what we teach, and we know challenges facing agriculture first-hand. We raise forage-based beef cattle, grow horticultural crops like pecans, and manage natural resources on seven research and demonstration farms that span 14,000 acres of southern Oklahoma. These farms provide a place for researchers to apply their work in a real-world environment. Producers can also visit our farms to see innovation in action.
We share our knowledge and expertise, including what we've learned from our research, with students of all ages. We host adult agricultural seminars and workshops related to cattle, forages, natural resources and economics. We also foster an awareness and appreciation for agriculture in next generation, our future problem-solvers. We offer a variety of interactive learning opportunities, including tours and internships.Toggle navigation
Pecan Management Calendar: November to January
To properly manage a successful pecan orchard, a well-developed plan should be implemented. Planning will help growers and managers be prepared for tasks that will need to be addressed throughout year. This calendar can be used as a resource to help with planning.
Continue to harvest your pecans.
Mark trees for removal that are damaged, and have small or undesirable pecans.
Pecan Nut Show
Select best examples of each nut cultivar and submit to local or state show. Learn more about Oklahoma State Pecan Show at 
Continue to harvest your pecans.
Mark for removal damaged trees and those with small or undesirable pecans.
Continue harvest if needed.
Complete needed ground work like tilling and packing (to smooth any rough spots on orchard floor), remove debris left over from harvest, etc.
Collect graftwood while trees are dormant. For more information on graftwood collection practices, visit 
Once harvest is complete, clean and perform any equipment maintenance needed before storing.
Remove trees marked previous year for removal.
Decisions will depend on age of tree.
Young trees (trees not in production): Train to a central leader. Remove competing leaders and weak crotches.
Older trees (trees that are producing): Remove damaged branches and low hanging branches that interfere with tree management.
January is preferred time to collect graftwood. Go online to 
 to learn different methods of pecan tree grafting and pecan tree management.
