Advanced performance and extended operating temperature help improve reliability
 Components, Inc. (TAEC), a committed technology leader, has added two new med-voltage photorelays, TLP3553and TLP3555A, to its lineup of high current photorelays.  The new products can be used to replace mechanical relays in applications including industrial equipment, general purpose inverters, HVAC, thermostats, building automation equipment, semiconductor testers and more.
The new photorelays with integrated are fabricated by using the latest U-process to reduce on-state resistance (25mΩ typ. for TLP3553& 45mΩ typ. for TLP3555A).  The TLP3553provides an off-state output terminal voltage (V
) of 60V, a constant on-state current (I
) of 3A.  Both devices are capable to handle up to 9in pulsed mode operation (I
Both photorelays are fully approved to UL1577 for safety-critical applications.  The operating temperature is rated from -40°to 110°C, making it easier to allow for a temperature margin in system-level thermal design.
Unlike mechanical relays, photorelays have no physical contacts that are subject to wear and tear, an advantage that can lead to greater product reliability.  The use of photorelays also supports the development of smaller and thinner products.  As high current is required in order to drive mechanical relays, buffer transistors are often being added, resulting in higher part count and larger board space. Photorelays can be operated by as low as 3mA.  Therefore, buffer transistors are not needed. Both TLP3553and TLP3555come in a DIP4 package.  Gull-wing (SMD) and wide creepage options are also available.

TOKYO—Devices & Storage Corporation (“Toshiba”) today launches an integrated dual H-bridge brushed motor driver that includes an output current limiter function rated at 50/ 3.0The new TB67H401device can handle applications where monitoring and feedback of the motor state is necessary, including office equipment, ATMs, home appliances, robotic cleaners and more—all devices that have grown in popularity in recent years and that often incorporate brushed motors.
Until now, safe control of brushed motors has been accomplished by limiting the upper value of the motor current through a constant current limit. Over current is generated by the motor lock and is read from an external resistor through external circuitry, operational amplifiers and comparators, which increases the component count and circuit complexity.
The highly integrated TB67H401is fabricated with Toshiba’s Biprocess and has an inbuilt flag output circuit, which monitors the current state and indicates when it has reached the upper threshold. This ends the need for external circuitry and delivers smaller, more efficient motor solutions with reduced costs.
The TB67H401supports a total of four drive modes; forward (CW), reverse (CCW), brake (short brake) and stop (off). It also includes a mode switching function that extends the application range. Single-bridge mode supports a single channel current of up to 6.0A, while dual-bridge mode allows use of two motors, with a single driving up to 3.0per motor.
The low on-resistance MOSFETs incorporated into the H-bridge (High side + Low side =0.49Ω typ.) ensure low losses and efficient operation. An internal regulator allows the device to be driven from a single 5supply.
The tiny device is housed in a 7mm x 7mm x 0.9mm QFN48 package, which also includes thermal shutdown detection, over current protection and under voltage lockout. general error detection signal enhances system safety by providing a warning to the main system controller.
Applications that need to monitor and feedback results on the motor drive state—industrial equipment, including office equipment and ATMs, home appliances, and robotic cleaners.
flag output function outputs results from the current limiter detection to an external device. It helps reduce the number of external amplifiers and comparators.
Single-bridge mode supports high load drives (large current drive of 6.0 A). Dual-bridge mode supports driving of two motors with a single (3.0 / 2 channels). It widens the range of applications.
Thermal shutdown detection, over current protection, and under voltage lockout. The error detection signal can be output to the external device, helping to enhance safety.

TOKYO-Devices & Storage Corporation has launched a new 4-channel power amplifier for car audio, "TCB503HQ” that delivers strong resistance to power surges. Sample shipments start today with mass production scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2019.
Building on Toshiba’s proven development capabilities in ICs for car audio, the new product achieves a higher reliability with an analog fine process resistant to power surges. It also supports 6operations suitable for vehicles equipped with idling reduction systems, which have become popular in recent years. This feature suppresses popping sounds that occur when power voltage fluctuates.
Other features include a built-in filter to improve resistance to extraneous high-frequency noise, and to prevent generation of abnormal noise even when there is high-frequency noise from mobile phone radio waves and adjustment of door mirrors.
Using the clip detection signal to control the volume and tone control circuit, the sound quality of the set can be improved.
Built-in mute and standby functions, offset detection, short circuit detection, and output clip detection
Built-in protection circuits (overheat, overvoltage, short to the power supply, short to the ground, and load shorted)
