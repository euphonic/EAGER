Accompanying the spread of the Internet, the importance of corporate Web sites is increasing and the number of people who use the World Wide Web as a means of accessing information is also rising. Since The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) - an international standards organization for the Web - announced its Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 in May 1999, initiatives to make Web content more accessible have progressed at many companies in Europe, North and elsewhere.
In these circumstances, Group has worked to increase its Web site accessibility in accordance with the Basic Commitment of the group
. We aim to ensure that Group Web sites are easy-to-use sites where all visitors can access the necessary information.
Measures to Implement the Guidelines
Anticipate that users with individual requirements will visit Web sites depending on the purpose of the Web site content: people with different objectives, people with and without physical disabilities, people of all ages, people with different levels of experience, and so forth.
The information disseminated on Web sites is a mixture of information targeted at a great number of users (for instance, company information and information on products for the general public), and information targeted at specific users (for instance, content for business partners, content requiring membership, content for children). At times it is not possible to provide all information in a form that is easy to use for all users. However, aims to provide information in a method appropriate to the anticipated users according to the purpose of publishing each Web site.
Anticipate that the Internet access environments of the individual users anticipated in 1. are diverse, and endeavour to ensure that visitors can easily obtain, understand, and manipulate necessary information.
Support technology employed to enable users to access Web sites is provided by many vendors in accordance with a variety of standards and is upgraded as the occasion demands. Also, the types, combinations, and individual settings of support technologies used by Web users vary according to the purpose and conditions of use. For these reasons, technical and cost constraints make unrealistic the operation of Web sites that support all the support technologies used by visitors to Toshiba's Web sites. In this regard, in operating Web sites aims to take note of these trends so as to support as many of these technologies as possible, focusing on frequently used standard support technologies.
Endeavour to ensure that all the users anticipated in 1. are able to smoothly obtain, understand, and manipulate necessary information from every Internet access environment anticipated in 2.

Advanced performance and extended operating temperature help improve reliability
IRVINE, Calif. — August 7, 2018 —
 Components, Inc. (TAEC), a committed technology leader, has added two new med-voltage photorelays, TLP3553and TLP3555A, to its lineup of high current photorelays.  The new products can be used to replace mechanical relays in applications including industrial equipment, general purpose inverters, HVAC, thermostats, building automation equipment, semiconductor testers and more.
The new photorelays with integrated are fabricated by using the latest U-process to reduce on-state resistance (25mΩ typ. for TLP3553& 45mΩ typ. for TLP3555A).  The TLP3553provides an off-state output terminal voltage (V
) of 30V, a constant on-state current (I
) of 4whereas the TLP3555provides an off-state output terminal voltage (V
) of 60V, a constant on-state current (I
) of 3A.  Both devices are capable to handle up to 9in pulsed mode operation (I
), which help ensure a bigger margin for design safety.
Both photorelays are fully approved to UL1577 for safety-critical applications.  The operating temperature is rated from -40°to 110°C, making it easier to allow for a temperature margin in system-level thermal design.
Unlike mechanical relays, photorelays have no physical contacts that are subject to wear and tear, an advantage that can lead to greater product reliability.  The use of photorelays also supports the development of smaller and thinner products.  As high current is required in order to drive mechanical relays, buffer transistors are often being added, resulting in higher part count and larger board space. Photorelays can be operated by as low as 3mA.  Therefore, buffer transistors are not needed. Both TLP3553and TLP3555come in a DIP4 package.  Gull-wing (SMD) and wide creepage options are also available.
Follow the link below for more information on the new products and photorelays line-up.

New devices increase power supply efficiency even further
IRVINE, Calif. — August 28, 2018 —
 Components, Inc. (“Toshiba”) has launched a new series of next-generation 650power MOSFETs that are intended for use in server power supplies in data centers, solar (PV) power conditioners, uninterruptible power systems (UPS) and other industrial applications.
The first device in the series is the TK040N65Z, a 650device that supports continuous drain currents (I
) up to 57and 228when pulsed (I
). The new device offers an ultra-low drain-source on-resistance R
 of 0.04Ω (0.033Ω typ.) which reduces losses in power applications. The enhancement mode device is ideal for use in modern high-speed power supplies, due to the reduced capacitance in the design.
Power supply efficiency is improved as a result of reductions in the key performance index / figure-of-merit (FoM) – R
. The TK040N65shows a 40% improvement in this important metric over the previous IV-device, which represents a significant gain in power supply efficiency in the region of 0.36% - as measured in a 2.5kcircuit.
The new device is housed in an industry-standard TO-247 package, ensuring compatibility with legacy designs as well as suitability for new projects.
will continue to expand their product lineup to meet market trends and help improve the efficiency of power supplies and systems.

Current limiter signal enables feedback control
TOKYO—Devices & Storage Corporation (“Toshiba”) today launches an integrated dual H-bridge brushed motor driver that includes an output current limiter function rated at 50/ 3.0The new TB67H401device can handle applications where monitoring and feedback of the motor state is necessary, including office equipment, ATMs, home appliances, robotic cleaners and more—all devices that have grown in popularity in recent years and that often incorporate brushed motors.
Until now, safe control of brushed motors has been accomplished by limiting the upper value of the motor current through a constant current limit. Over current is generated by the motor lock and is read from an external resistor through external circuitry, operational amplifiers and comparators, which increases the component count and circuit complexity.
The highly integrated TB67H401is fabricated with Toshiba’s Biprocess and has an inbuilt flag output circuit, which monitors the current state and indicates when it has reached the upper threshold. This ends the need for external circuitry and delivers smaller, more efficient motor solutions with reduced costs.
The TB67H401supports a total of four drive modes; forward (CW), reverse (CCW), brake (short brake) and stop (off). It also includes a mode switching function that extends the application range. Single-bridge mode supports a single channel current of up to 6.0A, while dual-bridge mode allows use of two motors, with a single driving up to 3.0per motor.
The low on-resistance MOSFETs incorporated into the H-bridge (High side + Low side =0.49Ω typ.) ensure low losses and efficient operation. An internal regulator allows the device to be driven from a single 5supply.
The tiny device is housed in a 7mm x 7mm x 0.9mm QFN48 package, which also includes thermal shutdown detection, over current protection and under voltage lockout. general error detection signal enhances system safety by providing a warning to the main system controller.
TB67H401is now in mass production.
Applications that need to monitor and feedback results on the motor drive state—industrial equipment, including office equipment and ATMs, home appliances, and robotic cleaners.
flag output function outputs results from the current limiter detection to an external device. It helps reduce the number of external amplifiers and comparators.
Single-bridge mode supports high load drives (large current drive of 6.0 A). Dual-bridge mode supports driving of two motors with a single (3.0 / 2 channels). It widens the range of applications.
Other error detections
Thermal shutdown detection, over current protection, and under voltage lockout. The error detection signal can be output to the external device, helping to enhance safety.
50 V, 6.0 (Single bridge mode),50 V, 3.0 (Dual bridge mode)
Forward (CW), Reverse (CCW), Brake (Short brake), Stop (OFF)
Built-in flag output function that shows the result of the current limiter detection.

Technical Review
TOKYO-Devices & Storage Corporation has launched a new 4-channel power amplifier for car audio, "TCB503HQ” that delivers strong resistance to power surges. Sample shipments start today with mass production scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2019.
Building on Toshiba’s proven development capabilities in ICs for car audio, the new product achieves a higher reliability with an analog fine process resistant to power surges. It also supports 6operations suitable for vehicles equipped with idling reduction systems, which have become popular in recent years. This feature suppresses popping sounds that occur when power voltage fluctuates.
Other features include a built-in filter to improve resistance to extraneous high-frequency noise, and to prevent generation of abnormal noise even when there is high-frequency noise from mobile phone radio waves and adjustment of door mirrors.
Using the clip detection signal to control the volume and tone control circuit, the sound quality of the set can be improved.
Maximum output
High output power and low distortion
Built-in mute and standby functions, offset detection, short circuit detection, and output clip detection
6operations (engine idling reduction capability)
Built-in protection circuits (overheat, overvoltage, short to the power supply, short to the ground, and load shorted)
