It all starts with a friendship between two men, plenty of natural curiosity and two kitchen stoves.

Our procurement function ensures the timely, global supply of goods and services at suitable market conditions, in the required quality and in accordance with the Group’s ethical, ecological and social standards.
regards adherence to these sustainability standards within its supply chain as a crucial factor in the value chain. By acting responsibly in collaboration with our suppliers, we aim to minimize risks and create stable, long-term business relationships with our partners. For this reason, we apply not just economic standards, but also environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) standards in choosing new suppliers or continuing our relationships with existing ones. These standards are defined in Bayer’s Supplier Code of Conduct , which is based on the principles of the Global Compact and our Human Rights Position.
To help our suppliers practice sustainability in their daily business, we have developed a Supplier Sustainability Guidance, which is based on the Supplier Code of Conduct. This document aims to provide concrete examples of good practices and benchmarks which suppliers can use, and references such as the regulatory framework and standards governing Bayer’s sustainability efforts.
In the areas of palm oil and soy we support the certified sustainable production of these raw materials as a purchaser of plant oil derivatives, which is especially important in Southeast Asia and South America. We are member of the renowned organizations “Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil” (RSPO) and “Round Table Responsible Soy” (RTRS), and purchase so-called “credits” according to the quantities we use. The financial value of these credits rewards farmers who undertake to grow palm oil and soy in a legal and ecologically, socially and economically sustainable way and who demonstrate this as part of an audited certification process.
Further information about sustainability in supplier management can be found in the Procurement section.
We unequivocally promote the realization of human rights . We firmly believe that respect for people is essential to achieving lasting business excellence. The main areas we address are: 'Employees and working conditions,' 'Harassment and discrimination,' 'Freedom of association and collective bargaining,' 'Child labor,' and 'Health and safety.'
We see ourselves as a responsible corporate citizen. We support the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and a number of globally recognized declarations for multinational corporations. We fully endorse the principles of the United Nations Global Compact Initiative, of which we are a founding member. We naturally also respect the sovereignty of individual states in implementing human rights.
Child labor is mentally, emotionally and physically harmful. It is socially unacceptable and ethically indefensible. We do not tolerate child labor. And our zero tolerance policy applies across our supply chain. We have a long term commitment to eliminating child labor in seed production and to raise awareness on the child labor issue around the world. With a clear commitment of Zero Tolerance to child labor, we have taken the initiative to eradicate child labor from our supply chain through our multi-level Child Care Program (CCP) which commenced in India in 2007 and has since been expanded to countries like Bangladesh and the Philippines. The primary objective is getting children off the fields of contract seed production farmers and into school.
We have taken systematic actions to prevent child labor in the seed supply chain through this program. Our local teams visit the fields used, for example, in cotton, rice and vegetable seed production throughout the cultivation season in order to raise awareness of the issue and best seed production practices and to determine the age of the workers there. Thanks to this diligent monitoring system, which is supported by local educational initiatives, we are achieving considerable success with eliminating child labor from our seed production activities. Our activities and progress is also validated during annual external audits. Our seed producers are trained in raising agricultural efficiency. Suppliers who can verify that they strictly observe our ban on child labor receive a bonus. Graduated sanctions are applied for non-compliance. These range from written warnings to termination of the contract in the case of repeated non-compliance.
We regard school attendance not only as essential for children’s development but also as an effective tool to drive the elimination of child labor. We therefore have initiated several projects to help children and young adults to access education. In some villages in India for example, we are working towards improvement of school infrastructure and facilities that would help increase enrollment in the local Government schools as well as providing computers. Additionally we also visit the parents of children we find working in the fields to convince them of the importance of school education.
We promote this approach with the “Learning for Life” initiative within our Child Care Program. This initiative aims to ensure that children and young people get access to quality education including everything from reintegrating children into the regular school system to vocational training measures. Since 2007, The Bayer-Ramanaidu Vignana Jyothi School of Agriculture in India took shape as a part of our overarching objective to boost and nurture science education, and to unlock the potential of bringing scientific training and education to be a part of our sustainable agricultural practices. The School is a social intervention model developed and successfully implemented with a farm-based supply chain that aims at getting young adults trained on a 6 months course about various aspects of agriculture so they could have access to diverse tools and job opportunities.
Raising awareness on this important issue requires continued widespread action within the agricultural sector including governments. We remain committed to supporting collaborative stakeholder efforts to address best practices in seed production and especially raise action levels with respect to elimination of child labor. We believe that eradicating child labor is essential to the advancement of a society.

Bayer's Position on the Protection of Biodiversity
Fight against Non-Communicable Diseases
maintains a global network of research and development locations in which about 15,000 researchers around the world focus on improving the health of people, animals and plants. We augment our own research capacities through collaborations and strategic alliances with industrial and academic research partners around the world. These include leading universities, public research institutes, partner and start-up companies, and science and innovation centers established by to give young companies access to features such as suitable laboratory and office infrastructure in the direct vicinity of Bayer’s own research facilities.

Solutions for Smallholder Rice Farmers: Cultivating White Gold
Vietnamese rice farmers are under stress. Whether caused by pests and diseases or weather-related calamities which threaten their livelihood, farmers are finding new ways to cope. Their overall strategy: a more holistic approach.
We aim to contribute to increased agricultural productivity in regions such as Africa and Asia and intend to expand our presence there. Our offerings are tailored to the needs of those farmers and range from integrated crop solutions based on improved seed varieties through modern crop protection technologies and training in good agricultural practice and environmental protection to product safety programs. We also engage locally in Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to help increase the income of smallholder farmers through sustainable agriculture. Activities include expanding local value chains and training measures. This contributes to improving the living situation of the local population and enhancing the availability of staple foods, fruits and vegetables in the project countries. In such PPPs, we cooperate with numerous partners including local governments, farmers’ associations and cooperatives, nongovernmental organizations and agricultural input industries. We are currently participating in PPPs associated with the value chains for rice and potatoes in Sub-Saharan Africa, India and Southeast Asia.
Industry and academic collaborations are often instrumental in putting new inventions and technologies into the hands of those who need and use them. For centuries, mankind has benefited from such partnerships that yield products that make our lives better and easier.
Boosting productivity of the agricultural sector in emerging and developing countries requires close collaboration between government and the private sector. In Germany, the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development in June 2012 put together an initiative on food security in emerging and developing companies. We are a founding member and the initiative will - in the words of 
, Member of the Board of Management of and President of the Crop Science Division - ‘make a sustainable contribution to strengthening food security for our hungry planet.' Specifically, it harnesses the expertise of companies to address the agricultural productivity gap in emerging and developing countries. Local food value chains are strengthened, with supply chains made more efficient and sustainable. This is how we stabilize food production and availability for the people who need it the most.

To us, sustainability means safeguarding our future social and economic viability. Understood in this context and as a part of our corporate strategy, sustainability is integrated into our day-to-day procedures. We underline our mission as a company that acts sustainably through our commitment to the Global Compact and the Responsible Care™ initiative, as well as through our involvement in the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD).

Our innovations, products and services contribute to overcoming some of the biggest global challenges, including the goals of “Zero Hunger” (2) and “Good Health and Well-Being” (3) in particular.
As part of Bayer’s corporate strategy , sustainability is firmly established at Board level. Responsibility for the Group’s sustainable orientation lies with the Board of Management member responsible for Human Resources, Technology and Sustainability in his role as Chief Sustainability Officer, and with the Sustainable Development Committee (SDC) under the auspices of the Health, Safety & Sustainability function. The sets targets and draws up initiatives, management systems and corporate policies, and is responsible for their implementation. Operational implementation is effected with the help of nonfinancial targets and performance indicators throughout the value chain, based on a clear definition of responsibilities in the corporate structure and the identification of major areas of activity using a materiality analysis. Corporate policies ensure our sustainability principles are firmly established in business operations and are implemented through corresponding management systems, committees and processes. The review and revision of these regulations and internal audits ensure that our management systems are continuously improved and aligned to the respective requirements.
We analyze and regularly evaluate what the major stakeholders expect and require from the Group. Thanks to this approach, we are quick to identify sustainability-relevant opportunities and risks and current developments in our key areas of activity, and can incorporate these into our strategy. 2016 we analyzed our previous areas of activity. This involved assessing the topics in our last materiality analysis and reexamining their relevance for the organization. The relevance to of the 24 nonfinancial topics identified in this prosess was evaluated in respect of sales, costs, risk and reputation by selected internal and external stakeholders.
The results of the internal and external viewpoint survey were combined in a Materiality Matrix.
We have analyzed the results of the materiality analysis with respect to their relevance for the value chain and reporting in accordance with the G4 guidelines. During this process, the 24 topics relevant for were condensed into 11 main areas of activity, presented to the Board of Management and approved by it. In view of the separation of Covestro and the planned acquisition of Monsanto, we will reexamine our areas of activity in 2018 using a comprehensive materiality analysis.
The current Annual Report contains a graphic showing the assignment of our areas of activity to the stages of the value chain.
