Qorvo prides itself on its social and environmental programs and performance. However, we cannot be successful in this area unless our suppliers are also. We are a team — Qorvo and our supply chain — working together to satisfy the needs and requirements of the most technologically advanced customers in the world.
This page explains our requirements to our suppliers and provides tools to help them be successful. The majority of these requirements are detailed in our Qorvo Banned and Restricted Substances Specification (SPE-001275) . However, we will use this web page to discuss those requirements in greater detail and offer some tools to our suppliers. We include links to these tools and documents within the expandable text below, but you can also access them on our Supplier Resources page; select "Product Compliance" from the filter dropdown on that page to view them. If you need more information or have any questions about these requirements or the content on this web page, please contact us at qorvogreen@qorvo.com .
The expandable sections below discuss specific requirements for suppliers on the following:
There are many substances banned or restricted from use in Qorvo products, or banned from use in processes to make Qorvo products. These substances are listed in SPE-001275 , the Qorvo Banned and Restricted Substances specification . There are several tables within this document:
Table 1: Lists the substances and categories of substances that are restricted or banned in products or assembly processes for Qorvo products.
Table 2: Lists those substances and categories of substances that are required to be tested by analysis and the approved analytical technique.
Certificates of Compliance (CoCs) are documents in which a supplier certifies that their product complies with certain legal or customer requirements. Qorvo requires CoCs to state whether a supplier's products:
Are antimony-free (≤ 700 ppm at the homogeneous material level).
Are PFOS- and PFOA-free.
Qorvo would prefer a single Costating compliance to all of these requirements. CoCs should be updated annually or upon request.
If a chemical, material or component is used to manufacture Qorvo products and becomes a part of those products, we require third-party analytical lab reports at the homogeneous material level for the following:
4 new RoPhthalate compounds (DEHP, BBP, DBP, and DIBP)
We will probably add more substances to this list in the future, as more substances are added to the Rodirective.
For a definition of "homogeneous materials," please see the Product Content and Regulatory Compliance page and expand the "RoDirective" section. Also, note that Qorvo considers semiconductor chips to be homogeneous materials for the purposes of the Rodirective.
These test reports should be less than one year old and should be updated annually. The lab reports must be signed by the lab technicians and by an approving manager. The reports should list the analytes, detection limits, methods and results. The reports should contain a flowchart showing the sequence of steps for the analysis, and a picture of the materials that were tested to allow Qorvo to determine that the appropriate material was tested.
The testing laboratory must be certified to 17025. You can provide proof of this certification either by including a statement on the testing report or by furnishing a copy of the 17025 certification for the laboratory. Laboratories that meet Qorvo requirements are SGS, ALS, and Intertek. Other laboratories are allowed, as long as they meet the requirements in this section.
For an example of a lab report, please see the GaAs lab report that we have provided in Supplier Resources .
material declaration is a document that describes the materials and substances from which a product is made. For example, a capacitor would be broken down into the following homogeneous materials: ceramic (or glass), the inner electrode, the outer electrode, the underplating and the surface plating. Each of these materials would have a distinct homogeneous composition and would be composed of various substances. An example of a material declaration format is the IPC-1752 standard. Other examples may be in spreadsheet or other documentation forms. Qorvo will accept many formats of material declarations — the important issue is that we receive the information, not the form that it is in.
Suppliers of materials and process chemicals must supply Qorvo with a Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) or Safety Data Sheet (SDS) that provides Qorvo with sufficient information to determine the composition of the materials that will be added to the Qorvo product. Qorvo requires that suppliers of components that go into Qorvo products must supply Qorvo with a full material declaration that accounts for 100% of the weight of the component.
This section applies to our SubContract Assemblers (SCAs) — those suppliers who assemble Qorvo products, package those products and ship the products to our customers.
Packaging is governed by different regulations throughout the world. Below, we discuss some of the regulations. For a more extensive list of packaging regulations, please see Appendix of the IPC-1758 Declaration Requirements for Shipping, Pack and Packing Materials Standard , which can be downloaded for free from the website.
The Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste
The Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste (94/62/EC) restricts the summed concentration of several heavy metals (cadmium, mercury, lead and hexavalent chromium) in packaging materials to less than 100 ppm in total. However, Qorvo customers have further limited the combined concentration to less than 80 ppm in total.
The 61st entry in Annex of the Regulation restricts the allowable concentration of dimethylfumarate to less than 0.1 ppm in the "article or parts thereof." Qorvo assumes that the 0.1 ppm limit applies at the "packaging material" level as defined below.
Consider the following example. An ships Qorvo's components in tape-and-reel packaging to customers. The customer wants 12,500 parts. There are 2,500 parts in carrier tape put on a reel with a Pro-Band support to prevent collapse of the reel edges. Each reel is labeled with a product bar code label and put into a moisture barrier bag with a desiccant bag and a Humidity Indicating Card (HIC). The moisture barrier bag is then vacuum sealed and labeled with three labels — product bar code label, label and Rocompliance label. Each bagged reel is put into a cardboard box that is taped shut and labeled, and five of these single-reel boxes are packed into a larger box for shipment, which is also taped shut and labeled. The packaging materials are:
The carrier tape in which the parts are encapsulated
The product bar code labels on the moisture barrier bags
The labels on the moisture barrier bags
The Rocompliance labels on the moisture barrier bags
The labels on the multi-reel cardboard box
The tape used on the cardboard boxes
If the used an adhesive or staples to close the boxes, then the adhesive or staples would also be packaging components.
Please note: Packaging materials are considered to be "articles" under the regulation, and therefore any Substances of Very High Concern (SVHCs) that may be present in packaging materials must be disclosed if they are above 0.1% by weight at the packaging component level.
In the section below, we will provide some background and resources where you can find more detailed information on Conflict Minerals. We will explain our expectations for your conflict minerals management, and we will outline what we look for when we review the conflict minerals information you send us.
any other mineral or its derivatives determined by the Secretary of State to be financing conflict in the or an adjoining country.
This definition of Conflict Minerals means that all coltan, cassiterite, gold and wolframite are Conflict Minerals, regardless of the source of the minerals. If the source was determined to be located in the Covered Countries, then reporting to the is required, along with a Conflict Minerals Report.
If you are interested in more information on the Conflict Mineral law, regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act, and recommended guidance for complying with the regulations, some good resources are available at:
Qorvo is a member of the Responsible Minerals Initiative, or “RMI” (formerly the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative, or “CFSI”), and has adopted the tools for the management of Conflict Minerals, including the RMI’s Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT). We require that our suppliers use the to report the tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold smelters used in the components and materials sold to Qorvo. The is updated frequently and the latest version can be downloaded at http://www.responsiblemineralsinitiative.org/conflict-minerals-reporting-template/ .
Regardless of how suppliers choose to create the CMRTs they send to Qorvo, suppliers need to understand how Qorvo is going to review these templates.
We have created a Review Criteria document that will walk you through each field on the and explain what we will look for when reviewing your template. In general, we are looking for:
evidence that your company has established due diligence measures (QA-QI) – also see "Supplier Expectations" below; and
logic in your answers (for example: if you answer “Yes” to Questions 1 and 2 for tin, you should have at least one tin smelter on your smelter list).
Please review Qorvo's Review Criteria document in its entirety before submitting your to Qorvo. This document will provide you with everything you need to know about how we will review your submission.
Qorvo has aligned its Conflict Minerals Program with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas, and we expect our suppliers to do the same. Suppliers are expected to cooperate in providing due diligence information to confirm that the relevant products supplied to Qorvo are conflict-free. This means that any 3metals contained in the products supplied to Qorvo either: (1) do not directly or indirectly fund armed conflict or violence in the Covered Countries, or (2) originate from recycled or scrap sources.
As part of their due diligence practices, Qorvo suppliers are expected to:
Adopt a conflict minerals policy that is consistent with Qorvo’s policy, and implement a management system to support due diligence efforts and compliance with their policy.
Do a complete “refresh” of the conflict minerals data and smelters in their supply chain at least twice a year (mid-year and end-of-year).
What do we mean by complete "refresh"?
We view the Smelter List as a snapshot of the smelters in our supply chain at a particular time. It is not a tool that can track the chain of custody of all the materials in our products. Some of our suppliers have a high rate of turnover of the materials used to build their products, while other suppliers purchase enough raw materials at one time to last several years. Therefore, we cannot track actual materials through the supply chain. When suppliers refresh their smelter data, it should represent who they are currently purchasing from. For example, if in the past a supplier has purchased from a smelter that is no longer in operations, that smelter should not appear on the suppliers updated CMRT.
Corporate Social Responsibility and Code of Conduct
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) — sometimes known as Social and Environmental Responsibility (SER) — is defined in 26000 as the "responsibility of an organization for the impacts of its decisions and activities on society and the environment." These responsibilities should result in transparent and ethical behavior that does the following:
Contributes to sustainable development, including health and the welfare of society
Takes into account the expectations of stakeholders
Is in compliance with applicable law and consistent with international norms of behavior
Is integrated throughout the organization and practiced in its relationships
There are several different programs available that companies can use to guide them in the development of their program. The first two programs below are specific to the electronics industry, while the others are more general in nature:
Qorvo is a member of the and as such, we have adopted the Code of Conduct . We require our suppliers to complete a Self-Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) for those facilities that produce components or materials for Qorvo, or provide assembly services.
We encourage our suppliers to download the Code of Conduct from the hyperlink in the above paragraph. Within each section of the code (Labor, Health and Safety, Environmental, Ethics and Management System), there are several standards as listed below. Please see the Code of Conduct for a detailed explanation of the requirements for each of these standards.
For each of these standards, the will ask you the following about the management system elements that support your company's approach to the standard:
What is your company's commitment or policy addressing this standard? Is it documented?
Who within your company is responsible for meeting this commitment? Is there a senior manager who is responsible for compliance with this commitment?
What legal and customer requirements are applicable to this commitment? Have you identified, documented and understood those requirements?
Have you assessed the risk of your company and its suppliers not meeting this requirement? What is the likely impact of not meeting it? How can you mitigate the risk of your company or its suppliers not meeting this requirement?
Do you have goals, targets, objectives or similar aims to improve your company's and its suppliers' performance to meeting the requirements of this standard? What are they? What progress are you making?
Have you trained the appropriate personnel on the requirements of this standard? Is this training documented? How do you track whether the appropriate personnel receive and understand the training?
How have you communicated your commitment to this standard to the general public and your employees, local community, customers and suppliers? How do you update these groups on your progress toward meeting the requirements of the standard?
Do you audit your company's and your suppliers' performance in meeting the requirements of this standard? Is this auditing process integrated with your normal quality auditing system and possibly also your environmental, health and safety auditing system? Is this system documented? What records are kept? What are the recent results of audits conducted under this process?
Do you use a corrective action process for the results of the auditing process? Is this system documented? What records are kept? What are the recent results of corrective actions that are closed and open under this process?
Do you extend the requirements of this standard to your suppliers? How do you communicate the requirements to them? How do you monitor their compliance?
This section applies to our SubContract Assemblers (SCAs) — those suppliers who assemble Qorvo products, package those products and ship the products to our customers.
Qorvo calculates Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and reports to the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) on an annual basis. We are encouraging our SCAs to engage in calculating and reporting Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Scope 1 emissions account for those emissions created by on-site combustion and chemical usage and Scope 2 emissions account for emissions generated by the use of electricity.
Guidance on completing the report can be found at http://www.cdproject.net/en-US/Pages/guidance-climate-change.aspx .
To accurately capture the emissions created in the course of manufacturing Qorvo products, it is necessary to include information relating to the emissions of our SCAs. We have created an Excel reporting tool, Input Template , that allows our SCAs to easily report this data to us. You can find the template for download on our Supplier Resources page. We require data on the annual usage of the following:
Natural gas (reported in therms)
Conversion factors are included in the reporting tool, but you can see these additional resources for energy and volume conversions:
