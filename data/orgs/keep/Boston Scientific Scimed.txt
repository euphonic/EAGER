How Pacemakers Work
After Your Procedure
Living with a Pacemaker
Your pacemaker is designed to monitor and treat your abnormal heart rhythm. By keeping your heart from beating too slowly, your pacemaker can treat symptoms like fatigue, lightheadedness and fainting. It can allow you to get back to a more active lifestyle by automatically adjusting your heart rate to match your level of activity.
 Here, you can learn about out how your pacemaker works, what to expect right after your procedure and how to lead a full and active life with your new pacemaker.
Innovative Pacemaker Technology
We are dedicated to advancing heart rhythm management technologies by creating:
Implants that are smaller, longer lasting and connected
Pacemaker and health data tracking capabilities through wireless remote monitoring systems
Pacemaker models that are FDA-cleared compatible
Your Specific Pacemaker
	Download details about your pacemaker, including its size and how long you can expect it to last.

Meet an all-female Robot Competition Team
Meet an all-female Robot Competition Team – The Robettes, (Mendota Heights, MN)
The Robettes, an all-female, team of high school students, build and compete in regional and international robotics competitions held by FIRST
). Since 2006, more than 25 girls have competed in annual robotics competitions.  The Robettes are innovative, hardworking and resourceful influencers, whose actions are inspiring the minds of tomorrow today. The team has won numerous awards including: the Engineering Inspiration award, the Industrial Design award, the Team Spirit award, and the Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Entrepreneurship Award. In addition to sharing their experience with incoming freshmen, the award-winning Robettes travel around the country gaining important (Science Technology Engineering Art & Math) knowledge, while learning the importance of project planning, communication, collaboration and teamwork.  Each year supports teams, like the Robettes, in markets where we have a business presence.

Science School Program in Japan
Japan launched a medical science experiential school for children to become "kid doctors" and learn about the human body. The school is aimed at providing medical and education to nurture future generations. The school programs were designed for children to have hands-on learning about the body and the world of medical care.
Cork Supports Local Initiatives
	Cork Women’s Network introduced a school partnership programme in to encourage girls aged 12 to 14 years in the surrounding community to pursue studies in (Science, Engineering, Engineering, Maths) subjects.
The initiative involves school classes visiting Cork’s manufacturing facility and engaging with female role models, technicians and engineers who speak to the young women about their chosen career paths and involve them in practical science experiments, designed by
 Junior Achievement,
 to show the application of expertise in industry. Students also receive an interactive tour of the site.
The school partnership programme also involves female Engineers visiting local primary level schools (ages 6 to 11 years) to talk about careers in STEM.
