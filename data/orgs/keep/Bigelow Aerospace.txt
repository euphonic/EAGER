In addition, Mr. provides the daily strategic leadership at in its design, development, and testing                                    of expandable habitat architectures where employs approximately 150 employees at its Las Vegas facility. Mr. has successfully launched                                    two subscale spacecraft called Genesis & into orbit as well as the Expandable Activity Module (BEAM), which is attached to the Tranquility module of                                    the International Space Station. Moreover, Mr. serves as the program manager of the B330 spacecraft – Aerospace’s main habitation system for                                    and beyond destinations.

is the godfather of expandable habitat technology. Spurred by NASA’s mission to explore Mars, initiated the TransHab program to pursue the development of expandable habitat technology. Although the technology showed promise, the program was canceled due to lack of funding.
sits on over 50 acres in North Las Vegas, NV.
Secured License for Expandable Technology from - SEP, 2003
purchased a patent license from for expandable space habitat technology. For over a decade, the team has evolved expandable technology and has enhanced the performance and reliability of the architecture.
The launch of Genesis at the Kosmotras Space and Missile Complex in Russia, marked the first launch for Aerospace. The mission successfully validated the expansion, pressurization and safe operation of an expandable spacecraft.
The launch and operation of a second expandable spacecraft was also a success. Upon the completion of the Genesis program, began its work on human-rated habitats.
After a historic launch for and SpaceX, the Expandable Activity Module (BEAM) became the first expandable module to reach the International Space Station.
