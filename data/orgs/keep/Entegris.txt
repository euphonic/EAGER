bold move at the right time.
We could see it coming. Increasing customer demand meant an increase in capacity and resources were required—so we did something about it. 
With our i2(Ideas to Market) Center in Bedford, Massachusetts (USA), we have created one of the most advanced facilities of its kind. The 80,000 sq. ft. facility represents a $60 million investment and includes additional manufacturing capabilities, advanced process controls and upgraded quality monitoring systems for the creation of production quantities of (ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene) filtration membranes and other UPE-based technologies. The membrane is a core material used in high-purity filtration solutions for semiconductor and life sciences applications. 
Since its initial opening in 2014, our i2Center has become one of the world’s most advanced centers for the research, development and manufacturing of filtration media technologies for liquid and gas chemistries, as well as proprietary, innovative low-temperature coating technologies. These products are core components for filtration and electrostatic clamp (E-Chucks) solutions used in our customers’ demanding manufacturing environments.
The i2Center is home to approximately 100 employees, many of whom hold advanced engineering degrees in chemical engineering and related sciences.

Our approach to manufacturing the products and technologies we deliver is driven by our insatiable desire for purity and performance. Your requirements are demanding so our standards are exacting. It’s why we are obsessed with reducing contamination at the nano level to squeeze another 1% yield out of your already 97% pure process. And it’s why our process may span four cleanrooms to produce a material that is discarded after just one use.
Our goal is to know that our efforts continue to enable your advanced technology platforms in the purest way possible to enable your processes and maximize your yield.
From our development labs to our scale-up engineering to our high-volume manufacturing operations, we take great care to ensure that design, materials and processes are aligned to deliver the purest products we can create.

Deputy Chief Technology Officer, Montray Leavy discusses how the design and requirements of deposition, filter and front opening unified pod (FOUP) have changed and how semiconductor material suppliers are facing increasing development challenges.
Montray pointed out that in the 28 nm process liquid chemical materials were used in deposition. As the process went below 10 nm (such as 7, 5, and 3 nm), it required rarer materials. These rare materials included not only liquid chemical materials but also solid chemical materials. Therefore, it was a challenge for material suppliers to vaporize the solid chemical material and produce an even film layer on the wafer.
In order to respond to advanced processes, the filter must be cleaner, which means that the material supplier must spend more time designing the product to ensure higher purity.

Expands State-of-the-Art Clean Manufacturing Facility in Malaysia
30% increase in total manufacturing capacity of advanced technology FOUPs to meet customer demands for the next decade
The Fourth Industrial Revolution is having a massive impact on manufacturing. New technologies are requiring an enormous number of chips and a greater emphasis on the performance and reliability of those chips.  “This new standard calls on solutions that will enable the future of technology and we are seeing this through the increase in demand for our leading wafer handling products” said Bertrand Loy, president and CEO, Entegris. “To meet this surge, we have expanded our Kulim manufacturing capacity and capabilities, adding new tooling, molding machines, and numerous updates to the assembly area to create a superior and unparalleled manufacturing facility.”
“This expanded state-of-the-art clean manufacturing facility enables to support wafer and reticle handling demand on a global basis for leading nodes now and into the future,” said Bill Shaner, senior vice president of Advanced Materials Handling Division, Entegris. “This expansion clearly aligns with the evolving needs of the industry addressing both the high demand for our award-winning FOUPs and also the emergent need for Entegris’s ASML-qualified reticle pods, which are critical for logic makers adopting the most advanced lithography processes.”

Five things you should know about Entegris:
New mega-technology trends, such as AI, IoT, and Big Data to benefit Semiconductor demand is being driven by “The Fourth Industrial Revolution,” a new era which extends the impact of digitization in fields such as artificial intelligence, virtual/augmented reality, Internet of Things, and Big Data. The result is a broadening of semiconductor demand beyond PCs and mobile phones. Whether its memory devices or advanced-logic chips, more semiconductor production means more demand for suppliers, such as Entegris.
Materials are critical to the next generations of semiconductor
Until recently, the semiconductor industry has kept to Moore’s Law by “shrinking” chip features to pack more transistors into a smaller area. For today’s most advanced chips, achieving faster, more powerful semiconductors that consume less power is increasingly dependent on new materials. These new high-value engineered materials need to be delivered at an even greater level of purity to achieve desired outcomes. The result is an expanding consumption of materials and an increasing need for more effective contamination control solutions. These trends are making an even more important part of the industry’s value chain.
Entegris’ unique breadth of technology is expanding its markets
has one of the broadest portfolio of solutions in the industry, from specialty engineered chemicals and gases to the most-advanced filtration solutions of its kind to the components that move and protect these materials through the supply chain. There is virtually no other company than can provide all these solutions under one roof. This full-spectrum offering allows to develop highly differentiated solutions, responding to customers’ challenges even faster.
