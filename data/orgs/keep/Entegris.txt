bold move at the right time.
We could see it coming. Increasing customer demand meant an increase in capacity and resources were required—so we did something about it. 
With our i2(Ideas to Market) Center in Bedford, Massachusetts (USA), we have created one of the most advanced facilities of its kind. The 80,000 sq. ft. facility represents a $60 million investment and includes additional manufacturing capabilities, advanced process controls and upgraded quality monitoring systems for the creation of production quantities of (ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene) filtration membranes and other UPE-based technologies. The membrane is a core material used in high-purity filtration solutions for semiconductor and life sciences applications. 
Since its initial opening in 2014, our i2Center has become one of the world’s most advanced centers for the research, development and manufacturing of filtration media technologies for liquid and gas chemistries, as well as proprietary, innovative low-temperature coating technologies. These products are core components for filtration and electrostatic clamp (E-Chucks) solutions used in our customers’ demanding manufacturing environments.
The i2Center is home to approximately 100 employees, many of whom hold advanced engineering degrees in chemical engineering and related sciences.

Engineered for Results 
Our approach to manufacturing the products and technologies we deliver is driven by our insatiable desire for purity and performance. Your requirements are demanding so our standards are exacting. It’s why we are obsessed with reducing contamination at the nano level to squeeze another 1% yield out of your already 97% pure process. And it’s why our process may span four cleanrooms to produce a material that is discarded after just one use.
Our goal is to know that our efforts continue to enable your advanced technology platforms in the purest way possible to enable your processes and maximize your yield.
From our development labs to our scale-up engineering to our high-volume manufacturing operations, we take great care to ensure that design, materials and processes are aligned to deliver the purest products we can create.

Deputy Chief Technology Officer, Montray Leavy discusses how the design and requirements of deposition, filter and front opening unified pod (FOUP) have changed and how semiconductor material suppliers are facing increasing development challenges.
Montray pointed out that in the 28 nm process liquid chemical materials were used in deposition. As the process went below 10 nm (such as 7, 5, and 3 nm), it required rarer materials. These rare materials included not only liquid chemical materials but also solid chemical materials. Therefore, it was a challenge for material suppliers to vaporize the solid chemical material and produce an even film layer on the wafer.
From 28 nm process to 7 nm process, the metal impurities of the product must be reduced by 100 times, and the volume of contaminated particles must be reduced by 4 times.
In order to respond to advanced processes, the filter must be cleaner, which means that the material supplier must spend more time designing the product to ensure higher purity.

Five things you should know about Entegris:
New mega-technology trends, such as AI, IoT, and Big Data to benefit Semiconductor demand is being driven by “The Fourth Industrial Revolution,” a new era which extends the impact of digitization in fields such as artificial intelligence, virtual/augmented reality, Internet of Things, and Big Data. The result is a broadening of semiconductor demand beyond PCs and mobile phones. Whether its memory devices or advanced-logic chips, more semiconductor production means more demand for suppliers, such as Entegris.
Materials are critical to the next generations of semiconductor
Until recently, the semiconductor industry has kept to Moore’s Law by “shrinking” chip features to pack more transistors into a smaller area. For today’s most advanced chips, achieving faster, more powerful semiconductors that consume less power is increasingly dependent on new materials. These new high-value engineered materials need to be delivered at an even greater level of purity to achieve desired outcomes. The result is an expanding consumption of materials and an increasing need for more effective contamination control solutions. These trends are making an even more important part of the industry’s value chain.
Entegris’ unique breadth of technology is expanding its markets
has one of the broadest portfolio of solutions in the industry, from specialty engineered chemicals and gases to the most-advanced filtration solutions of its kind to the components that move and protect these materials through the supply chain. There is virtually no other company than can provide all these solutions under one roof. This full-spectrum offering allows to develop highly differentiated solutions, responding to customers’ challenges even faster.
Profit growth driven by focused execution and financial discipline
2017 was a record year for in terms of revenue, cash flow, and profits. Delivering profitable growth is a core goal. is relentless in its focus on operational execution and on being financially disciplined, which will continue to drive’s Entegris’ profitability.

is performing well and its sales have exceeded our expectations       during the quarter, reflecting key secular demand drivers for higher       process purity."
Mr. Loy added: "Our unique capability to address the industry's       increasing materials complexity and purity challenges is driving our       long-term growth prospects and our ability to outperform the market. For       the full year 2018 we expect to leverage our sales growth of       approximately 15 percent into growth of our non-earnings per share       of approximately 30 percent."

The Company’s condensed consolidated       financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting       principles generally accepted in
the United States
(GAAP). Adjusted       EBITDA, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Segment Profit, and Adjusted       Operating Income together with related measures thereof, and non-      EPS, are considered “Non-financial measures” under the rules and       regulations of the

. The presentation       of this financial information is not intended to be considered in       isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial       information prepared and presented in accordance with The Company       uses these non-financial measures for financial and operational       decision-making, as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons, as       well as comparisons to our competitors' operating results. Management       believes that these non-financial measures provide meaningful       supplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by       excluding certain items that may not be indicative of our recurring       business operating results, such as amortization, depreciation and       discrete cash charges that are infrequent in nature. We believe that       both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-      financial measures in assessing and understanding our results and       performance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future       periods. We believe these non-financial measures are useful to       investors both because (1) they allow for greater transparency with       respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and       operational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional       investors and the analyst community to help them analyze our business.       The reconciliations of Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Operating       Income and Adjusted EBITDA, and Net Income (Loss) to Non-      Earnings per Share are included elsewhere in this release.
