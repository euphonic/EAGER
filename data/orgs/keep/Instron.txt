With its new development center in Shanghai, has extended its development competences in the Chinese and Asiatic markets, thus being able to respond
to specific market challenges more quickly. One of the highlights in the new development center is the Hydropuls® axle test rig. 
Read more about how is using the Hydropuls® axle test rig to expand their markets.
            One of the main tests - a German start-up company - specializes in is breast implant testing: this test can be demanding on dynamic testing machines because it is a load-control requirement, while operating on a very compliant specimen - this requires good controller performance and a large actuator stroke. 
Find out how the ElectroPuls solved this challenge.
Mechanical testing tissue microstructure is becoming an increasingly active area of research, especially in oncology. It has been shown that changes in this microenvironment are key in cancerous growth, namely an increased tissue stiffness. External mechanical forces can directly influence cell signaling regulating and influencing growth. Investigating the mechanical properties of the microenvironment is, therefore, key to creating a biomechanical model of tumor growth. 
Learn how the ElectroPuls helped to achieve this.
            Long-term mechanical property of materials under variable frequency and amplitude will be a trend in the future. For traditional servo-hydraulic machine, its frequency range is too small, the maintenance costs is higher and also too much noisy when running. And also if we want to do the fatigue test of ultra thin steels, traditional electromagnetic resonance high-frequency fatigue testing machines are found difficult to dither. Both challenges urge us to find new solutions.   
            One of the challenges the bioMMeda lab - focused on biofluid, tissue, and solid mechanics for medical applications - faces is the need for flexible testing equipment that enables a multitude of tests in order to validate model simulations. The testing lab requires testing specimens in unique positions and orientations, in addition to testing at non-ambient temperatures and in fluid baths to simulate conditions in the human body. 
Learn how they overcame these challenges
            With an increasing demand from customers and new regulatory requirements that spanned across the globe, Samyang Biopharm needed an automated solution to remove the external factors that no longer suited their needs as a lab. 
See the changes they made with automation.
The lab's need was for evaluation testing of key biomedical components for industrial customers, in ways that were as close to real-life usage as possible. Critical to this was making sure that they could meet the industry's needs for dynamic testing in a variety of fields. 
As the leader in processing tubing and casings, Tubular Services, saw an opportunity to expand their business when demand increased for to support the expansion in non-traditional drilling to serve the energy market. 
To equip their students with the necessary experience for future success, Wentworth Institute of Technology had a vision to transform their lab into an advanced learning environment with the latest and most innovative technologies available.
With growing test requirements in terms of both quantity and complexity, it soon became clear to Synoste that to be successful the only solution was to own their test resources by bringing their testing in-house with their own equipment. 
Driven by the need to perform excellent research to develop new test methodologies specifically for thermoplastic composites, began to research equipment that matched the type of testing they were performing: state of the art.

D412: The Definitive Guide to Elastomer Tensile Testing
How to Perform a Tension Strength Test on Elastomers According to D412 
D412 is the most common standard for determining the tensile properties of vulcanized (thermoset) rubber and thermoplastic elastomers. Compounds in this family are used to create a vast array of consumer goods such as tires, footballs, and rubber bands. This family also produces highly specialized materials, such as O-rings on space shuttles, which must perform reliably under extreme environmental conditions.
This guide is designed to introduce you to the basic elements of an D412 tensile test, and will provide an  overview of the materials testing equipment, software, and samples needed. However, anyone planning to conduct D412 testing should not consider this guide an adequate substitute for reading the full standard.
What Does it Measure?
D412 measures the elasticity of a material while under tensile strain , as well as its behavior after testing when the material is no longer being stressed. D412 is conducted on a universal testing machine (also called a tensile testing machine) at a rate of 500 ± 50 mm/min until the specimen fails. Though D412 measures many different tensile properties, the following are the most common:
Tensile strength – the maximum tensile stress applied in stretching a specimen to rupture.
Tensile stress at a given elongation – the stress required to stretch the uniform cross-section of a test specimen to a given elongation.
Ultimate elongation – the elongation at which rupture occurs in the application of continued tensile stress.
Tensile set – the extension remaining after a specimen has been stretched and allowed to retract in a specified manner, expressed as a percentage of the original length.
Tensile Testing System
Most D412 testing  is performed on a tabletop universal testing machine with a variety of accessories that can be configured to properly perform an D412 tension strength test for elastomers and rubber.
standard package would include a  3300 Series test system , an long travel extensometer, and a pair of manual roller grips. This system is excellent for small-to-midsize elastomer manufacturing companies, or for those buying their first D412 system.
D412 describes two methods for testing, depending on specimen type. Please be aware that these two testing methods do not produce identical results. Test Method makes use of “dumbbell” or “dogbone” shaped specimens, while test Method is designed for ring-shaped specimens. Test Method is more commonly used than Test Method Dogbone specimens must be die cut from an injection molded sheet or plaque. The direction in which the sheet is extruded is important as it produces a subtle grain pattern in the material. For the most accurate results, half the specimens should be cut against this grain, and the other half should be cut with it.
There are six allowable types of dogbone specimens for D412 testing and two allowable types of cut ring specimens. The most commonly tested shape is a die cut dogbone specimen, which calls for an overall length of 115 mm (the gauge length being 25 mm), width of 6 mm, and thickness of 3 mm. Thickness of the specimen must be measured three times, with the median value being the accepted value.
To ensure conformance with the standard, all specimens used for D412 testing must be measured with a micrometer in accordance with D3767 . The Automatic Specimen Measuring Device feature in Bluehill® Universal allows operators to connect up to two micrometers or measurement devices to the computer and input the data directly into the software. This eliminates the chances of operator input errors and increases efficiency.
In order to test properly, specimens must be held perpendicular to the jaw faces and not tilted on an angle. Specimen misalignment can cause major variations in test results, and proper care should be taken to ensure that the specimens are all aligned consistently for each test.
One way of addressing misalignment is by using a jaw face that is close to the same width as the specimen, making it relatively easy to visually adjust alignment. The easiest way to prevent misalignment is to use a specimen alignment device which mounts directly onto the grip bodies. This is a simple bar that provides an adjustable stopping point so operators can easily see that their specimen has been aligned correctly.
Once grips are tightened onto the plastic specimens in preparation for running a test, unwanted compressive forces are frequently applied. These forces, although minute, can interfere with test results if not treated properly. It is important that they not be balanced after the specimen is inserted, as this will cause an offset in results. Bluehill Universal materials testing software can be programmed to normalize forces across multiple specimens and remove any slack or compressive force, ensuring consistent results between specimens. Specimen Protect , which is available on the 5900 Series universal testing machines, is designed to prevent damage to the specimen or system during the set-up phase of a test, before a test’s operational limits are defined. When turned on, Specimen Protect automatically adjusts the crosshead to keep any unwanted forces under a certain limit.
As elastomer samples stretch, their thickness decreases. For this reason, D412 recommends grips that tighten automatically. consistent and uniform pressure across the jaw faces ensures that thinning samples do not slip out of the grips during testing.  Side action pneumatic grips  with serrated faces are highly effective for testing elastomers. With pneumatic grips, the inlet air pressure adjusts automatically, enabling the gripping force to remain constant even if the specimen thickness changes significantly during a test. Another effective option is to use  self-tightening roller grips , which use a spring to put constant pressure on the sample during testing. For those using D12 test Method B, O-ring specimens can be tested with our  O-Ring Fixture . These grips prevent local stress concentrations by using rotating shafts on the upper and lower fixtures.
Extensometer
Although extensometers are not required by the standard, a strain measurement is recommended for the most accurate and repeatable results. Strain measurement based on crosshead travel can be less accurate due to elongation of the specimen outside the gauge length. The  Long Travel extensometers  are designed to work for elastomeric materials and can also be used through specimen break. The adjustable clamping force on the knife edges reduces premature failure of the specimen. This extensometer can measure strain up to 3,000% from a gauge length of only one inch.
non-contacting extensometer like the Standard or Advanced Video Extensometer 2 ( 2 or 2 ) is the most ideal for elastomeric materials. It is especially suited for specimens that are fragile or require an environmental chamber for testing. Non-contacting video extensometers offer the added benefit of reducing results variance due to operator interference and increasing efficiency in labs with high throughput needs.
Environmental Chamber
Elastomers tested under D412 are often destined for future use under non-ambient conditions. Because ambient conditions have a great impact on the tensile properties of elastomers, care must be taken to ensure that test conditions mimic those of the intended end-use application. Test speed, temperature, humidity, specimen dimensions, and pretest conditions all have notable effects on test results and must be controlled in order for the test to produce useful data. To ensure that these elements simulate the material's end-use application, D412 is frequently performed inside an environmental chamber where heating or cooling (LN2 or CO2) can be used.
Throughput
For labs looking to increase their throughput, several modifications to the system setup can be made.  Automatic specimen measuring devices, pneumatic grips, and specimen alignment devices all increase test efficiency by reducing the amount of manual input needed from the test operator. However, testing time for D412 depends on the expected elongation of the specimen and cannot be minimized.  For materials with high ductility, the duration of the test consumes the majority of the overall test cycle. In these cases, multi-station test frames may provide the best throughput because the operator can run up to 5 tests simultaneously. 
Fully automated test systems are also available and are designed to incorporate specimen measurement, specimen loading, testing, and removal. These systems can run for hours without requiring any operator interaction. In addition, these systems help reduce variability due to human error.

Errors in Your Data
. This 60 minute course is specifically tailored for new and experienced operators of materials testing equipment, including lab technicians and engineers, looking to understand the various data integrity issues that they might encounter during testing.
Using an online diagnostic approach, the Errors in Your Data course shows users how to identify errors caused by a variety of factors, including physical measurements (load cells/extensometers), testing fixtures, misalignments, software method development, temperatures and humidity, and more. The course explains potential causes of these errors and teaches you how to resolve them in a timely manner.
“Data errors can be hugely detrimental, not to mention frustrating – so we made this course available online to create a convenient way for organizations to empower their operators to diagnose and get to the root cause of the most common errors seen in materials testing, and then resolve these issues so that the lab can get back to testing,”
 explains Carmen Corriveau of the Training Center.
Introduced in 2017, the eLearning Courses debuted with the popular 
Basic Introduction to Materials Testing: Static
 course, which provides an overview of the theory and practice of static materials testing. This is one of many training options the Training Center offers, including onsite training at customer sites, regional courses, and training classes at the factory.
“It is our objective at to provide our customers the best ownership experience by delivering the highest quality products, expert support and world-class service.”
