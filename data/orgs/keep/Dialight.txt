Learn why more companies install than any other industrial fixtures in the world.
Our customers operate their businesses in harsh industrial environments requiring advanced lighting that is efficient, supports productivity, and above all, ensures the safety of their employees.
Traditional lighting technologies such as Metal Halide, Fluorescent and High Pressure Sodium, require significant and frequent maintenance. Work sites and plants must stock many different types of lamps, ballasts and other fixture components to maintain these systems. These older technologies have short lifespans, poor lumen maintenance and contain material harmful to our environment. When designed properly, systems can offer superior energy efficiency, reliability, longevity, improved light levels, visual clarity, and ultimately cost savings from reduced or eliminated lighting related maintenance, certified lamp recycling and of course energy costs.
That’s why we specialize in lighting.
Industrial work sites require lighting that provides safe and effective illumination. Historically, High-Intensity Discharge (HID) lighting such as High Pressure Sodium (HPS) has dominated the Industrial Sector. However, lighting has many downsides, among them being the impact on our environment. Research confirms that industrial lighting is the most efficient solution to minimize energy consumption and avoid environmental impacts.
Low maintenance integrated design, high efficiency, and an industry leading warranty equal significant time and cost savings.
strategic focus on environmentally friendly technology and a commitment to helping all organizations, including our own, reach corporate sustainability goals.
Fixtures deliberately designed with no field replacement parts for the lifespan of the fixture and easy retro-fit kits to make installation and maintenance turn-key.

Debuts Vigilant® High Output High Bay Fixture with New Remote Power Supply for Elevated Mounting Heights
Debuts Vigilant® High Output High Bay Fixture with New Remote Power Supply for Elevated Mounting Heights
New 72,000 Lumen Package Offers 149 Lumens/Watt for High-Efficiency Lighting at Mounting Heights of 60 feet (18 meters) or More
) – (LSE:DIA), the global leader in industrial lighting technology, today launched its new 72,000 lumen Vigilant® High Output High Bay fixture, designed to deliver optimum illumination at mounting heights above 60 feet (18 meters).
The fixture is the first product to feature the company’s new custom-designed remote power supply that can be mounted up to 200 feet away from the fixture. This results in a much smaller fixture profile, making it easy to mount even where limited ceiling space is available. The power supply can also be located safely outside of the lighted environment for maximum installation flexibility.
The new High Output fixture expands on Dialight’s existing 45,000- and 60,000-lumen high-output products with 19 percent greater lumen efficiency, now up to 149 lumens/watt, to provide high-efficient lighting for lofty warehouses, shipyards, manufacturing and other applications with extremely high mounting height requirements.
will offer a version of this fixture with onboard occupancy sensor for mounting heights up to 40 feet, to enable even greater energy savings. The new High Output fixture is designed to be utilized globally, with UL-1598/A, CE, and listings.
Dialight’s precision optics direct the light where it’s needed—in the work plane—without wasting light on the walls or ceilings. The new High Output fixture is also available with a new up-light diffuser accessory that projects 7% of light output upward onto the ceiling where desired.
“This latest High Output fixture takes our signature High Bay to a whole new level – literally – to provide superior visual clarity, efficiency and safety compared to equivalents, even in the most challenging locations,” said Marty Rapp, Group Chief Executive. “This fixture is indicative of our commitment to responding to our customers’ needs with flexibility and options to suit just about any application.”
The High Output fixture carries an industry leading 10-year warranty covering the entire fixture.
