 recognizes that it has a primary responsibility to pay dividends to shareholders, and has made it a basic policy to pay dividends in accordance with Company earnings.
With the digitization of stock certificates, administrative procedures such as shareholder address changes and purchase requests are now handled by an account management institution, such as the securities company with which you have an account. Please contact them directly. The transfer agent and share registrar (Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation) does not handle such requests.

Corporate Social Responsibility
has a history tracing back to the turn of the 19th century with the founding of the Okinoyama Coal Mine in Yamaguchi Prefecture. The coal development project was started as a silent partnership by local investors in what was then a small community.
 Driven by founder Sukesaku Watanabe's vision of "creating with infinite possibilities from the finite resources of coal, to bring long-term prosperity to communities," the people of continued expanding into new business areas to meet the needs of society. The machinery business evolved from manufacturing and servicing machinery used in coal mining, and the cement business leveraged coal resources in the area and widely available limestone and spoil (overburden) from coal mining in the surrounding region. The chemicals business evolved from using coal raw material to manufacture ammonium sulfate for fertilizer. These three businesses form the cornerstones of the Group today.
 The pioneering spirit of that has existed for more than a century is carried on today through operations in Chiba and Sakai, Japan, and extending to international operations encompassing Spain and Thailand. Our founder, Sukesaku Watanabe, embraced the ideals of coexistence and mutual prosperity to achieve corporate growth that brings prosperity to communities. These ideals drive as we continue to meet the challenges of the 21st century.

Group Basic Policies for CSR

Basic Policy for Anti-Social Forces
Among risks inherent to the Group's business and other risks, the following may exert an important influence on the decisions of investors. The Group is fully dedicated to a policy of recognizing these risks, avoiding and preventing their actualization, and minimizing and dealing with related problems should they arise. Statements below concerning the future represent the judgment of the Group as of May 11, 2017. Business and other risks not covered here may arise.
1. Fluctuations in the Raw Material and Fuel Markets
Purchase costs of raw materials used in the main products of the Group's Chemicals business are influenced by factors including international market conditions and fluctuations in crude oil and naphtha prices. Depending on supply and demand conditions for products, increases in prices of these raw materials may exert a material impact on the performance and financial position of the Group if increased costs cannot be reflected in selling prices in a timely manner. In addition, increases in the procurement costs of overseas coal, which the Group purchases for use in cement production and for in-house power generation, may also exert a material impact on the performance and financial position of the Group.
Earnings in the Chemicals business are highly dependent on demand trends and supply and demand conditions in Japan, Asia and Europe, the primary markets for this business's main products. Consequently, a substantial decrease in demand in these regions due to economic fluctuations, or worsening supply and demand conditions due to expansion of production capacity by other companies, an influx of products from other regions or other factors, could result in stagnant market prices or a significant narrowing of price spreads, which may exert a material impact on the performance and financial position of the Group.
In addition, in the specialty products business, timely development of materials that meet customer needs is paramount in supplying materials for use in products with quick turnovers, particularly in the core information technology (IT) and digital home appliance fields. Failure to meet customer needs due to delayed development or other factors may exert a material impact on the performance and financial position of the Group, as may decreased demand for information technology related products, which are particularly susceptible to market fluctuations.
3. Earnings in the Pharmaceutical Business
The Pharmaceutical business comprises a custom manufacturing business through which the Group manufactures pharmaceutical bulk ingredients and intermediates on consignment for pharmaceutical companies and an in-house business through which the Group conducts research and development for new drugs either independently or jointly with pharmaceutical companies.
The custom manufacturing business requires forward expenditures including those for production facilities of a certain scale that meet standards, though research and development expenditures are limited. New drugs handled by the custom manufacturing business may be unable to be commercialized due to the long lead time needed by the pharmaceutical companies to obtain production approval and to the possibility of delays in full-scale launch should approval be revoked after completion of custom manufacturing due to side effects or other factors. In addition, factors including the launch of generic drugs due to intensified competition in the market for pharmaceuticals manufactured from pharmaceutical bulk ingredients and intermediates under custom manufacturing and lapsed patents may lead to sluggish sales.
Drug discovery is broadly divided into independent research and joint research with pharmaceutical companies. Although the Group minimizes the risk of large clinical trial outlays and low success rates through a basic strategy of licensing out research in the final stages regardless of drug type, necessary research and development costs before that stage entail risk associated with possible failure of the research and market launch. In addition, authorization may be revoked and launch delayed, as is the case of development for new drugs by pharmaceutical companies. Materialization of these risks in the consignment production and in-house businesses may exert a material impact on the performance and financial position of the Group.
4. Export prices for cement
Cement is a core product of the construction materials business. In Japan, there is expected to be a certain degree of demand with the start of construction related to the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics. However, in export markets, a decrease in domestic demand in China and increased cement exports from Southeast Asian countries due to excess production capacity are causing a deterioration in the balance of supply and demand. This in turn may cause export prices to decline sharply and may place downward pressure on revenues. In response, the Group is increasing its waste processing in the cement manufacturing process to generate waste processing revenues, and is implementing various cost reductions. However, a further decline in export prices for cement could have a negative impact on the business results and financial position of the Group.
5. Earnings in the Machinery Business
Amid decreasing automobile industry demand for facilities stemming from lower sales volumes in developed countries, the molding machinery business of the Machinery & Metal Products business is working to enhance sales and services in newly industrialized countries, where automobile production is increasing rapidly, and to expand into non-automotive markets. However, the materialization of risks such as a decline in sales prices due to intensifying competition, soar of raw material or construction price may exert a material impact on the performance and financial position of the Group.
The Group minimizes exchange rate risk related to exports paid for in foreign currencies through hedge transactions such as balancing of debts and credits and foreign currency contracts. However, short- and medium-term exchange rate fluctuations that exceed forecasts may exert a material impact on the performance and financial position of the Group.
Group overseas subsidiaries record financial statements in local currencies, leading to exposure to the influence of exchange rates when these amounts are converted into yen. In addition, losses on exchange rate fluctuations may occur at the time of conversion into local currencies for redemption, interest payment and settlement of liabilities of dollar denominated interest-bearing liabilities held by Group production companies in Thailand.
Fluctuations in financial markets at the time of capital procurement exert a material impact on the performance and financial position of the Group. The Group minimizes risk related to interest rate fluctuations through interest swaps and other hedges, but short- and medium-term interest rate fluctuations that exceed forecasts may exert a material impact on the performance and financial position of the Group.
The Group manufactures and sells products in Asia, North America and Europe. Overseas operations entail economic risks related to factors including unforeseen changes to laws and regulations, weakening of the industrial base, the ability to secure personnel and acquire technical proficiency and labor union issues, in addition to social and political confusion resulting from terrorism, war and/or other factors. Emergence of these risks may impede overseas operations and exert a material impact on the performance and financial position of the Group.
The Group recognizes the importance of intellectual property and works to protect it, but failure to do so properly and/or violation of UBE's intellectual property rights, or dispute violation of the third party’s intellectual property rights and inability to cover costs of product recalls or damages in the event that these risks materialize in connection with product flaws may impede operations and exert a material impact on the performance and financial position of the Group.
10. Industrial Accidents and Disasters
In the event that a large-scale industrial accident, earthquake, windstorm or flood should occur and cause substantial damage to the production facilities at any of the Group plants that handle hazardous materials or high-pressure gas, factors including compensation and other costs, loss of opportunities caused by cessation of production activities, compensation for customers and erosion of public trust may exert a material impact on the performance and financial position of the Group.
Additionally, an accident or disaster at a supplier of a key raw material could impede business activities and negatively influence the performance and financial position of the Group.
The Group conducts its businesses according to the laws, rules and other regulations of the countries and regions where it operates. However, any modification or strengthening of these regulations may exert a material impact on the performance and financial position of the Group due to restrictions on the Group's business activities, increased costs of regulatory compliance, accounting and tax responses to the regulations, or other effects.
In the past, the Group manufactured and sold products containing asbestos, and used construction materials containing asbestos in plant facilities. In order to eliminate asbestos from plant facilities, the Group plans to institute a series of complete or partial changes of facilities, for which certain expenditures are expected until the changes are complete. Moreover, in the event that employees (including retired employees) or residents in the vicinity of the plants face health hazards, an increase in employees receiving workers' compensation, lawsuits, efforts to further strengthen regulations and other factors may exert a material impact on the performance and financial position of the Group.
Since May 2008, the Japanese government and 40 building material manufacturers, including Board Co., Ltd. (a consolidated subsidiary of UBE), have been defendants in lawsuits brought jointly and severally by construction workers and their survivors, alleging that the defendants are responsible for asbestos-related disease that affected the plaintiffs due to inhalation of asbestos particles from asbestos building materials used at construction sites. In rulings to date by the court of first instance, all claims against Board Co., Ltd. have been dismissed. At the present time, there are five pending claims in higher courts in Tokyo, Osaka, and Sapporo pursuant to the dismissal of the claims, and claims have been filed with the district courts of Sapporo, Tokyo, Yokohama, and Kyoto. There are currently 10 pending claims for damages totaling up to ¥24.2 billion.
14. Write-Down Due to Decreased Profitability of Inventories
The Accounting Standard for Measurement of Inventories is applied for fiscal years beginning on or after April 1, 2008. Under this standard, inventories held for sale in the ordinary course of business are carried at their original cost on the balance sheets, but are judged to have decreased in profitability if the net realizable value falls below the original cost at the end of the period. In such cases, the balance sheet value is written down to the net realizable value, and the difference between the original cost and the net realizable value is charged against income for the period in which the loss occurs. If the Group judges inventories to have decreased in profitability because the net realizable value has fallen below original cost as a result of a rise in fuel and raw material purchase prices, a rise in manufacturing costs, an increase in fixed manufacturing costs, a decrease in production volume or a drop in product selling prices, this may exert a material impact on the performance and financial position of the Group.
15. Impairment of Fixed Assets
The Group adopted accounting standards for impairment of fixed assets in fiscal 2003. However, additional impairment losses in the event of further depreciation in the market value of unused land and/or significant deterioration of the operating environment may exert a material impact on the performance and financial position of the Group.
16. Marketable Securities
The Group holds marketable securities, the majority of which are shares of listed stocks. For this reason, a decline in the stock market may exert a material impact on the performance and financial position of the Group.
17. Retirement Benefit Liabilities
The Group calculates its retirement benefit liabilities and retirement benefit payments based on discount and retirement rates used in pension calculations, and on conditions including rate of salary increases and year-end working income ratios for pension assets. For this reason, deterioration of operating interest rates for pension assets, decreases in the discount rate and other factors may exert a material impact on the performance and financial position of the Group.
18. Deferred Tax Assets
The Group recognizes deferred tax assets resulting from temporary differences and operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes, which will reduce taxable income in future periods. Deferred tax assets are recognized in consideration of their probability of recovery based on forecasts of future income. In the event that actual taxable income should differ from projections, payment to adjust deferred tax assets may become necessary and exert a material impact on the performance and financial position of the Group.MENU

Management Policy / Corporate Governance
The Group Vision is set as described below based on the business principles of "coexistence and mutual prosperity" and "from finite mining to infinite industry."
Wings of technology and spirit of innovation. That's our driving our global success.
The Group will embrace a frontier spirit in seeking to achieve coexistence with the global community driven by the limitless possibilities of technology, while continuing to create value for the next generation through manufacturing. 
 The Group was founded over 120 years ago in the region as a coal mining operation, and has since continued to transform itself as times and industry change. During that time, technology and innovation have been two constant values running through the history of the Group.
 Our business activities center around "production" that is backed by technical ingenuity, combined with the ability to grasp modern needs and rise up to challenges without fearing change. The reach of the Group today extends across the globe, yet we continue to hold true to the same common values that are embedded in our very DNA.
The Group Vision describes our ongoing commitment to embrace the pioneering spirit held in our founding principles. It also describes our commitment to co-exist with all stakeholders—including shareholders, customers, business partners, employees, and communities—and co-exist with the global environment, by continuing to create value as a corporate entity.
The Group formulated and unveiled the new medium-term management plan covering three-year period ending in fiscal 2018. In addition, the Group will develop the plan by mobilizing the unified strength of the entire group under the basic policy in the plan described below.
Management Strategies
1. Strengthen the Business Foundation to Enable Sustainable Growth
The Group will focus on profit margin at each business divisions and improve profitability of existing products through painstaking cost reduction.
Under the business strategy emphasizing consolidated cash flow, the Group will carry out investment to support growth while ensuring that we will also reap the fruits of investment projects.
The Group will improve the ability to respond quickly to changes in the global business environment by expanding the network of business offices overseas and deepening coordination among Group companies in Japan and overseas.
For the revitalization and further growth of the chemicals segment, the Group will aim to achieve the recovery of the segment's operating income to 20 billion yen or more before the end of the final year of the new medium-term management plan to reach the starting point of the next growth stage.
2. Address and be Part of the Solution for Resource, Energy, and Global Environmental Issues
The Group actively pursues initiatives for realizing a sustainable society. In particular, the Group will promote a reduction in greenhouse gas through the reduction of energy consumption and the expansion of waste recycling throughout our supply chain, while ensuring overall profitability. It will also promote the creation and expansion of technologies and products to contribute to, among others, the reduction in environmental load.
→ FY2021 target: 15% reduction in greenhouse gas (as compared with FY2005)

Message from President
President & Representative Director
The origins of the Group began more than a century ago in 1897, with the founding of the Okinoyama Coal Mine in City, Yamaguchi Prefecture under the leadership of our founding president, Sukesaku Watanabe.
 Since then, has continued to expand into diverse areas of business including machinery, cement, chemicals, and the energy and environment sector while emphasizing business synergy and securing regional development. We continue to keep a diverse business portfolio, yet the nature of our business and our regional business development is changing significantly with the times.
 Under our medium-term management plan, Change & Challenge 2018, has set the following two basic policy, "Strengthen the Business Foundation to Enable Sustainable Growth" and "Address and be Part of the Solution for Resource, Energy, and Global Environmental Issues", and is implementing diverse strategies.
 Lately, UBE's non-chemicals businesses have generated strong results while the chemicals segment has struggled. The latter has been due to deflationary pressure brought on by shifting market conditions including increased competition from emerging countries, and from other factors such as shorter life cycles for chemical products. As we outlined in our medium-term management plan, will put every effort into further strengthening the revenue base from non-chemicals businesses and work to quickly revive the chemicals segment, as business conditions rapidly change. Our strength is technology and engineering, which we will leverage to enhance our competitiveness while we develop our business globally and move faster as a company.
 is committed to securing continued growth for all stakeholders including shareholders, and for the sake of future generations. Thank you for your continued support.

As a rule, the Board of Directors is chaired by a director who does not serve as an executive officer. The Board strives to achieve regulatory compliance and adhere to the articles of incorporation and Board rules, in making decisions about critical matters concerning the running of the Company. The Board also oversees the directors and executive officers to ensure that they execute their business in an appropriate and efficient manner. Executive officers are entrusted by the President and Representative Director to execute the Company's business, guided by the management policies decided by the Board.

Furthermore, does not use a nominating committee management system, but operates a Nominating Committee and Evaluation and Compensation Committee that report to the Board of Directors. As of the date of submitting the securities report, the committees are made up of six directors each, with each committee headed by an outside director.
Directors and executive officers currently serve a term of one year. The shorter term was adopted at a general shareholder's meeting on June 28, 2007, in order to facilitate greater flexibility in the appointment of directors and executive officers, and reinforce a results-oriented approach in striving to improve the business results of the Group for the short term as well as in the medium- and long-range future.
Under the current framework for corporate governance, incorporates outside perspectives in an effort to raise the efficiency of management and speed of decision making, and increase the transparency of management and better supervise management.
The Board of Directors has outlined a basic policy for establishing an internal control system (date of initial resolution: May 11, 2006; most recent revision resolution date: March 28, 2015).

(2) Standards Aimed at Ensuring Independence in the Selection of Outside Directors and Outside Corporate Auditors
In cases where candidates hold or have held an executive position with a business partner of or with a company that owns shares in or have another interest, when selecting outside director and outside corporate auditor candidates, careful consideration is given to the percentage of the total transaction volume of such companies made up by the transaction volume (sales, the balance of total outstanding borrowings, etc.) between and such companies, as well as to the equity stake such companies hold as a percentage of UBE’s total number of shares outstanding. These considerations are used to determine the presence or otherwise of any vested interest in the Company or conflict of interest with general shareholders.
(3) Approach to Independence of Outside Directors; Functions and Roles in Corporate Governance
Takashi Kusama was previously an executive officer of The Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ, now Mizuho Bank, Ltd.), which is one of UBE’s main lenders.
