markets a number of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral products and vaccines for the treatment or prevention of infectious diseases in markets around the globe
We're not done yet. We need to maintain our commitment and our interest and continue to bring our full capability set to trying to do more to help solve the problem of infectious disease.
executive vice president chief patient officer, Message from Julie Gerberding, M.D., M.P.H., executive vice president chief patient officer, TO:
 to address unmet medical needs in the prevention and treatment of infectious disease
 in antibacterial resistance as exemplified by our longstanding commitment to surveillance studies

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Our Work in HIV
                           Since the first products became available nearly three decades ago, we have worked to expand access to our medicines, build healthcare infrastructure, and address health and development challenges around the world.
An estimated 1.1 million people
 in the were living with at the end of 2015.
 living with did not know it.
people were living with worldwide at the end of 2016
 people globally became newly infected with in 2016
It is estimated that currently only 
 with know their status around the world
In the mid-1980s, began its clinical research in response to what the company perceived as a potential epidemic – our scientists were among the first to discover and develop medicines for the treatment of Today, a future where HIV/can be a manageable illness is closer, in part, because of Merck’s response to the crisis.
Dr. George Hanna, M.D., vice president, Research Laboratories, shares why our company has never stopped being committed to developing meaningful innovations to fight and help people living with the disease.
We continue to explore ways to enhance access to our medicines, particularly in the developing world, and through partnerships that seek to strengthen health systems to better deliver prevention and treatment services. Clearly, the need is too great for any one stakeholder to address, requiring coordinated efforts among many. We are committed to working with governments, donors, innovative and generic manufacturers, multilateral organizations and civil society to address the full range of factors affecting access.
                                   I’m sorry to tell you this…you’ve tested positive for HIV.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
We've done great things in the past.
Today, we're doing great things for the future.
Meeting tomorrow’s health care challenges will require more of the same dedication that has made us a leader in the health care industry. This video, created to celebrate our 125th anniversary, highlights our past discoveries and our promises for the future.
							Since 1891, our researchers have helped to find new ways to treat and prevent illness — from the discovery of vitamin B1, to the first measles vaccine, to cold remedies and antacids, to the first statins to treat high cholesterol. Our scientists have also helped develop many products to improve animal health, including vaccines and antibiotics. Today, as a premier research-intensive biopharmaceutical company, we’re focused on making important scientific advancements within hepatitis C, HIV, diabetes and immuno-oncology.
							While we are proud of our past, we are enthusiastic about the future. We aim to create a healthier, brighter future for people around the world.

How Will You Invent the Future?
My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Curiosity, inventiveness, and a passion for excellence. These are qualities that drive people to discover what’s possible as they work to help improve health around the world.
"For every question, there’s really an answer, you sometimes just have to spend a little bit more time thinking about it and take a step back and look at what’s actually in front of you."
"In our labs and across the industry, we are seeing how human genetics can help determine if a patient will respond to a certain medication."
"came here because science and innovation drive this company. believe that my best day at work — the day my team makes a potentially life-changing discovery — is still ahead of me. It’s the reason why stay."
"As a scientist, there's nowhere else like to work. can do basic research, apply it to an important problem, and see the results. How can you get better than that?"
"We get to invent every single day, sometimes it’s little things, sometimes it's big things."
"We are trying to understand biology in new and different ways to find new targets for drug discovery."
"think diverse teams are certainly our strongest teams, and think we, as women, have a lot to add."
"My first-hand experience with neurological diseases gives me the passion and motivation to go out and try to tackle really hard questions."
"As scientists, we have the flexibility to ask the big questions, the important ones that will come into play 5 to 10 years from now. These are the kind of questions that will drive innovation."
"We are all inquisitive, ambitious, and hard-working. The caliber of science that’s discussed just in the hallway or at a water cooler is incredible. And, it's inspiring to know that our ideas can be supported by Merck’s resources and technology."
"Everybody comes to work from a different place...We want to use that unique perspective to further the business."
"At Merck…feel that whatever path want to carve for my career, it’s possible."
"The people work with have become my family. There's a strong sense of camaraderie, especially within and our neuroscience department."
"What’s most exciting to me is having the flexibility to explore completely new areas of disease biology."
"feel fortunate that I've been able to work on the basic science end of our fight against HIV."
"We try never to forget that medicine is for the people."
George "enjoy impacting how other people do scientific research and allowing them to take what we’ve learned and apply it to their own situations and their own problems."
"What’s so cool about working at is that the problem solving we do, using cutting-edge research and science, results in positive impact to people's lives and their quality of life."
"To have the opportunity to do the research that do day-to-day here as well as the luxury of being able to do research on the International Space Station makes me feel incredibly lucky."
"What is most exciting is to be able to invent a new sort of chemical reaction one day, and use it in drug discovery the next day. And that’s just something that doesn’t happen in academia."
"job at is not just a job, it's a career. The company has a commitment to you and to your future."

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
With the prevalence of diabetes continuing to grow in many countries, it is one of the most serious chronic health challenges we face today.
of all cases of diagnosed diabetes in adults.
leading cause of death in the and the sixth worldwide.
Diabetes is one of Merck’s top therapeutic priorities and a point of passion for many colleagues at Merck, both personally and professionally.
Karen, a employee, shares her own experience living with type 2 diabetes.
Advancements in diabetes research are making a remarkable difference for patients, but there is much more work to be done. At Merck, we strive for scientific excellence and innovation in all stages of diabetes research, from discovery through approval and afterwards. am proud to be part of a research team that is committed to doing something truly meaningful to help people with diabetes.
America's Diabetes Challenge: Get to Your Goals
 is a Merck-sponsored program created with the American Diabetes Association to raise awareness among people with type 2 diabetes about the importance of working with their doctors to set and reach their A1goals. The program also aims to help people learn if they are at risk of low blood glucose and how to help reduce that risk.
Celebrated film, stage and television actress Epatha Merkerson was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2003.  She joined 
 to help encourage people with type 2 diabetes to achieve better control of their blood sugar.  Working with her doctor, Merkerson made a personalized diabetes management plan, which included diet, exercise and medication, to help her achieve her A1goal.  By sticking to that plan–and making changes with her doctor when necessary–Merkerson has kept her blood sugar under control.
Award-winning artist Tim McGraw, who has loved ones impacted by type 2 diabetes, has teamed up with and the 
 to spread the word about America's Diabetes Challenge and raise awareness of this growing epidemic.  McGraw is a strong believer in making healthy choices, and he's urging people to join him in challenging their families and friends with diabetes to work with their doctors to get to their A1goals.
After living with type 2 diabetes for many years, Chef Leticia Moreinos Schwartz's grandfather passed away from a stroke, one of the serious complications of diabetes.  That's why Chef Leticia, who specializes in Latin cuisine, is working with and the American Diabetes Association on 
 (Diabetes Challenge) to urge Hispanics with type 2 diabetes to work with their doctors to set and reach their A1goals.  The loss of her grandfather prompted her entire family to reevaluate their lifestyle, so Chef Leticia is sharing diabetes-friendly recipes that the whole family can enjoy.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
While global cancer cases continue to rise, the fight is personal – 
                               not only for patients and their loved ones but also for those focused on treating cancer
In 2012, it is estimated that approximately 14 million people worldwide were diagnosed and about 8 million people died from cancer.
By 2025, new cancer cases worldwide are predicted to exceed 20 million annually.
Today, every member of our team remains committed to smartly and collaboratively accelerating the drug development process and the speed with which we can bring forward new approaches to treat people with cancer.
Immuno-oncology is one of the most exciting areas in cancer research today.
is at the forefront of research that we hope could change the way cancer is treated.
vice president, clinical research, Research Laboratories
Understanding the Immune System and Cancer 
In the 1950s, researchers proposed that the immune system patrols the body to detect and destroy tumor cells.  Scientists and researchers had previously focused on cancer cells and treating cancer as a genetic disease.
Now the focus is shifting to the microenvironment in which cancer grows, including the immune system – an approach called immuno‑oncology. 
Immuno-Oncology has the potential to transform how physicians treat cancer and how patients benefit.
                                       We believe in the work we do and are working with the entire cancer community to help people with cancer and their caregivers better navigate their journeys.
Ultimately, our progress in changing the outcomes of cancer would not be possible without:
                                            …the support and involvement of the physicians who believe in the importance of advancing the care for patients through innovative clinical trials

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
 Ph.D., University of Southern California, School of Medicine; Postdoctoral Fellowship, Research Institute
  As scientists, we have the flexibility to ask the big questions, the important ones that will come into play 5 to 10 years from now. These are the kind of questions that will drive innovation.
One of the biggest catalysts right now in biotech and biopharmaceuticals is immuno-oncology. And one of the biggest regions for this research is the Bay Area.
Merck’s Dan Cua is in the middle of it all.
As a senior principal scientist in Immuno-Oncology Discovery, Dan currently works at Research Laboratories' Palo Alto site (which will be relocated to 
 in 2019) and is an expert in the field of immunology, an area that will help to advance Merck’s world-class immuno-oncology research.
The Power of the Immune System
“We are studying ways to harness the power of the immune system to go after various diseases,” he says regarding how his research in the field is advancing our immuno-oncology program. “This includes autoimmunity as well as cancer. It turns out that a fundamental denominator among many diseases is inflammation. For cancer, you want to turn inflammation on, and harness the immune system to go after the disease. In autoimmunity, you want to turn inflammation off to dampen the immune system that is mediating the pathology.”
Another big part of Dan’s work in the field is mentoring several  
 and five research scientists in Merck’s immuno-oncology early research.
“think the secret to success, really, is to work with scientists that are slightly different than you.   It’s the marriage of different ideas that ultimately drives science,” he says.  “run a group of really talented scientists from around the world.  We work hard to understand the process of developing medicine and how it can make a difference in patients' lives. I’m inspired by my interactions with other scientists. think that's what keeps me going.”
Expanding our Discovery Research Capabilities in South San Francisco
Dan is especially looking forward to moving into the new Research Laboratories South San Francisco facility, which will be an active participant in the local biomedical ecosystem and an integral part of Merck's world-class research and development network.
“Some of the best minds in the country are based in the Bay Area from information technology to computer science to biotechnology,” he notes.  “has a presence here. This kind of vitality has really driven the way we do science.”
The new nine-story, multi-disciplinary discovery research facility will accommodate more than 300 scientists and support research spanning exploratory biology through early clinical development.
“Being at the forefront of the immuno-oncology field, we have found many opportunities for collaboration with academia and industry. The cross pollination between industry and academia is really important. And being in the San Francisco Bay area, close to so many leading researchers, we have the opportunity to do so much more.”
It’s all part of what Dan sees as Merck’s investment in early-discovery research.
“Pharmaceutical companies are not all alike,” he says. “To me, stands out from the crowd because of its foundational support of basic research. think in this day and age, that’s rare. As scientists, we have the flexibility to ask the big questions, the important ones that will come into play 5 to 10 years from now. These are the kind of questions that will drive innovation.”

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
“remember feeling really tired, thirsty, achy, and just in a bad mood – just not myself. These were signals that something was going on inside me. One day, my wife said, ‘Jim, you’re not yourself. It’s time to go see a doctor and see what’s going on.’” 
As a physician, I’ve seen many patients struggle to deal with diabetes, so see the importance of bringing treatments to market so that patients have more choices.
– Eseng Lai, M.D., Ph.D, Scientific AVP, Diabetes Endocrinology Clinical Research, Research Laboratories
Regular exercise is an important part of an individualized diabetes treatment plan and may help people with type 2 diabetes reach their A1
(average blood glucose level over the past 2-3 months) goal.
In addition to improving A1C, regular exercise may have several benefits:
Reduces risk for heart disease and stroke
Worldwide, 1 in 11 adults has diabetes
1 in 2 adults with diabetes is undiagnosed
As many as 629 million people worldwide may have diabetes by 2045, if trends continue

                            Globally, an estimated 71 million people are living with chronic hepatitis infection.
Chronic hepatitis is a serious liver disease caused by the hepatitis virus (HCV) that, over time, can cause liver damage and cirrhosis (scarring of the liver).
adults in the U.S.
are people born from 1945 to 1965.
Approximately 3.5 million adults in the have chronic infection.  
More than 75 percent of them are people born from 1945 to 1965.
For nearly 30 years, has been at the forefront of the response to chronic HCV, and our team continues to work tirelessly to advance scientific knowledge of this significant global public health issue.
Included more than 135 Clinical Trials in 
Drs. Eirum Chaudhri and Eliav Barr have worked together at for many years in drug discovery.  Learn more about why they find working on chronic hepatitis so exciting, and what it takes to innovate.

  As a scientist, there's nowhere else like to work. can do basic research, apply it to an important problem, and see the results. How can you get better than that?
Although is equally as important as in building life, we haven't always given it equal billing.  has historically been thought of as a messenger, whose main job is to carry genetic information back and forth (an important job, sure, but not a very glamorous one.)
But what if is way more than a carrier pigeon? 
                            Enter John Howe, a scientist who is targeting as a means to possibly develop antibiotics.
"It's becoming an world," he notes. "People understand now more and more that is not just a passive messenger. It actually plays an active role in regulating cell function." 
In 2015, John and team made big waves in the scientific community when they published a cover story in the leading scientific journal 
 regarding a breakthrough they made in identifying a new type of synthetic molecule with antibacterial properties. They found that by targeting an structural element in bacteria it was possible to block cell growth in a manner similar to antibiotics. 
What the team has shown is the potential to use small molecules to impact an entirely new class of targets.
Considering that evidence has shown that bacteria are able to acquire resistance to antibiotics, finding a different way to create antibiotics is promising news.
"We think there's potentially a whole new field of targets available that we can research as a potential way to treat bacterial infections," John says. 
"can't wait to get to the lab each morning"
 John has had a pretty storied career while at Merck. 22-year veteran of the company, he first made his mark in research. In 2014, he was picked to lead a project to discover new molecules with the potential for activity against disease-causing bacteria.  
"Going from project to project is not unusual at Merck; it's part of our career development. The leadership here has always been very supportive and helped me to broaden my skill set and open up new career opportunities."
"There's rarely a day when don't look forward to going to work. can't wait to get in the lab each morning and see if my experiment from the night before worked," John says. "Moving around to different areas of research at has allowed me to learn and grow, while giving me the opportunity to contribute to some really valuable new treatments that ultimately improve people’s lives. That’s what keeps things fresh and exciting, and makes going to work each day so satisfying for me."

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
The Merck-Regenstrief Collaboration
                            For more than 125 years, our mission has focused on saving and improving lives. It's fair to say that we've learned a lot about medicine and health care. One of the things we understand well is the importance of collaborating with other leading scientific organizations to help find potential health care solutions.
                            In 2012, and Regenstrief, both leaders in their respective fields, entered into a multi-year collaboration – an agreement that was recently renewed. The goal? To use their respective resources and years of expertise collaboratively to discover new insights in health care. In that time, they've worked together on a range of projects which use de-identified clinical data to identify opportunities to better tailor care to a patient's unique characteristics and needs. Ultimately, the Merck-Regenstrief Collaboration seeks to improve the health of patients through data analytics, health care innovation, education and research.
 Science is a team sport… Learning the perspectives and collaborating with scientists have enabled us to pursue research in a way we haven't done before. It's helped inform the tools that have been created.
—Regenstrief investigator and acting director of its Center for Biomedical Informatics, Shaun Grannis, M.D., M.S., F.A.A.F.P.
 Both parties bring something different to the table... We bring different perspectives and viewpoints but one unified goal: to get patients access to care in an affordable, effective, and efficient way.
—Susan Shiff, Ph.D., senior vice president of Merck's Center for Observational and Real-World Evidence (CORE) 
 is the arm of that harnesses real-world and observational data to provide the best available information on the value of our medicines and the products that we bring to the market.
                            There have been more than 70 scientists involved in the Merck-Regenstrief Collaboration since its inception. And in that time, they've done more than 50 projects and over 30 publications, presentations and posters. They've been able to figure out new methods and approaches to doing analyses, as well as new ways of interpreting the information that they're deriving from real-world data.
                            Both and The Regenstrief Institute see the collaboration as a different way of looking at the patient's interaction with the health care system, whether it's within a pharmacy, a provider or clinician office setting, or even in conversations about their health symptoms.
                                According to Dr. Grannis, "It's exciting to be in the room with and Regenstrief scientists… because we want to make an impact on the world, and we believe that the questions we're tackling, the innovations we're contemplating will have real-world impact."
                                "We know that in any creative or innovative initiative, there are going to be failures. We learn from our failures so we take risks. We know that some of our ideas are going to fall on the cutting room floor and some are going to be hits. We're going to knock them out of the park. But it's important that we do take those risks in order to learn," Dr. Grannis added. "has been willing to take risks with us, and that's what's really made this work."
                            Real world data is the accumulation of data and information that is coming from medical centers, doctors, medical claims, pharmacies and other health care sources that aren't traditional clinical trials. It's the information that is produced in the day-to-day care of patients.
                            "This data is extremely important because it begins to provide us with greater insights into the totality of information of how a patient experiences a therapy in a real-world setting and a better understanding of how patients travel through the health care system," says Dr. Shiff. "By gaining a more complete understanding of what's happening in the real world as opposed to just what's seen in clinical trials, we will gain a fuller picture of the effectiveness of the therapies that we bring to market."
Frankly, think the sky's the limit.
 We have established very important working relationships and you can't underestimate the value of human relationships in any collaborative process. Together, we have a platform that we see being used to advance the art and science of data science that we believe will lead to real-world innovations to improve health care.
                            The Regenstrief Institute is a not-for-profit health care think tank based in Indianapolis on the campus of Indiana University. An internationally respected informatics and health care research organization, The Regenstrief Institute is recognized for its role in improving quality of care, increasing efficiency of health care delivery, preventing medical errors and enhancing patient safety. It was founded in 1969 by Sam Regenstrief, a philanthropist and dishwasher magnate who recognized that engineering principles could be applied to improve the health care system. Its mission was an auspicious one for the time: to study the efficiency of health care and the ease with which ordinary citizens could access it. Since that time, The Regenstreif Institute has grown to become a global leader in biomedical informatics, health services and aging research.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
 Senior Vice President of Global Science, Technology and Commercialization at Co. Inc.
 Caltech; Sc.D., Massachusetts Institute of Technology; postdoctoral at the Whitehead Institute of Biomedical Research
  feel  fortunate that I've been able to work on the basic science end of our fight against HIV, that I've been able to work in the lab and in the pilot plant and on the factory floor, making drugs for HIV, and that I've been able to help design low-cost supply chains.
In January 1994, with much of the East Coast buried in snow, scientists in Pennsylvania confronted the elements to continue their work in the lab. The Washington Post later described them as “brave or stupid,” but the researchers were motivated by something big: the potential for a breakthrough discovery in the fight against HIV.
Six years earlier, had been the first to prove that inhibiting the protease enzyme could prevent the virus from replicating. That discovery, however, was only the beginning. Shortly thereafter, the researchers and scientists endured a number of discouraging setbacks, including the failure of a promising compound and the death of one of our lead researchers in the Lockerbie bombing of Pan Am flight 103.
Michael (Mike) Thien, Ph.D., who currently heads up Global Science, Technology and Commercialization for Manufacturing Division, was one of those scientists.
“We had a great sense of urgency to the work that we were doing”
“It was a big challenge. The product itself was probably the most complex chemical entity that we had ever made,” Mike remembers.  “But we felt every day the real pressure of the fact that there were no good therapies for at the time. And so that added a great sense of urgency to the work that we were doing. No one said that they couldn't do this or that. No one said they couldn't stay after and work longer.”
All told, invested more than $700 million ($1.3 billion in today’s dollars) in the project, which included a massive clinical trial involving some 4,800 patients in 11 countries. Our commitment was finally rewarded in 1996, when the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved our treatment for in just 42 days, the fastest approval in history.
But before this breakthrough, Mike only encountered what he described as “failures” in his work. “Over the course of a two and a half year period, went from working on eight things that failed to one thing that worked. But that one thing that worked? Well, that was a watershed moment in my life.”
It’s something he encourages other scientists and researchers to remember. “There aren’t a lot of businesses where when something enters clinical trials, it only has a nine percent chance of making it all the way through to the marketplace,” he says. “When you’re doing development work in our business, you are going in with the philosophy that, yes, you’re going to get to work on a lot of great things. But you’ll be really, really lucky if one of them is going to the marketplace to make a difference.”
What is in store for the future for this distinguished scientist – and Merck?
As he enters his 27th year at the company, Mike currently runs the scientific and technology area in manufacturing at Merck. “get to do three things: From a manufacturing perspective, my area works on the last bits of development for processes and products and packaging for new products – we get them ready to be manufactured. The second thing is getting these very complex technical processes ready for the manufacturing floor. They have challenges from time to time. So oversee the technical teams to identify why we might be having an issue and how to fix it. The last thing I’m responsible for are all of our capital assets-- all of the buildings and factories we build.”
He’s still as busy as ever, but Mike only sees the bright side of all of the work. “There are some things you can do working for a company like that you would never be able to do in academia, where would never be able to develop a new operating model or come up with a new manufacturing process. would never be able to say that my work contributed to help the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. Those are the things you don’t get to say as an academician,” he notes.
“But at a company like Merck, you get to say them with pride.”

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
                          We understand how important it is to get medicines and vaccines to the people who need them, and providing those medicines is at the center of what we do.  
In 2012, became the only source for the and many countries of an oncology medicine called TICE® BCG/OncoTICE® after other companies that made similar medicines stopped production. TICE® BCG/OncoTICE®  is an older medicine that has been prescribed by oncologists for decades.
Today, we continue to be the only source of this medicine in many countries and due to increasing global demand, we are working to help minimize disruption to patient care and address this imbalance.  When we face supply shortfalls, we do our very best to work with health authorities, patient advocates and health care professionals to allocate our medicines in a manner that takes into account the needs of patients across countries.
To help meet the surge in demand and ensure that cancer patients can continue to receive the medicine they need, the team at Merck’s manufacturing facility in Durham, North Carolina, which manufactures TICE® BCG/OncoTICE®, is going above and beyond.
When the other suppliers stopped production, the Durham team quickly responded by stretching the production processes and enabling production to the full extent of our manufacturing equipment capacity. The site increased production of TICE® BCG/OncoTICE® by more than 100% all while reducing the lead time for the production of a batch by nearly 40%.
Today, the Durham team continues its unwavering commitment to maximizing its production capacity, including by working through holidays and adverse weather events. The site has adopted an innovative strategy to implement equipment reliability and improvement projects while production continues concurrently.   “has invested in our operations and facility to increase the supply of this medicine,” shared Kacey Fetcho-Phillips, Director of Operations.  “Our team is committed and dedicated to producing reliable supply of our products in both the short- and long-term for our patients.”
TICE® BCG/OncoTICE® is complex to produce. Each batch takes many months to make, 30 days of which is waiting for the growth of the bacteria used to make the medicine. Each batch also requires extensive quality testing, which takes an additional 45 days, before packaging and distribution.
has taken considerable production capacity actions and also continues to keep health authorities, patient advocates and health care professionals informed about the availability of TICE® BCG/OncoTICE® so that we can ensure best patient care.  continues to remain focused and is committed to ensuring that we can provide TICE® BCG/OncoTICE® to our customers and patients as quickly and as reliably as we can.

Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus. It typically starts with a few days of fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, and loss of appetite, followed by swollen salivary glands.
According to the World Health Organization, in 2016 there were a total of 583,199 reported cases of mumps worldwide. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of reported cases in the United States, from 229 cases in 2012 to 5,629 cases in 2017.
Mumps causes puffy cheeks and swollen jaws, which is a result of swollen salivary glands. Some people who get mumps have very mild symptoms or no signs at all, and often they are unaware they have the disease. Most people with mumps recover completely in a few weeks.
Swollen and tender salivary glands under the ears on one or both sides (parotitis)
Symptoms typically appear 16-18 days after infection, but this period can range from 12-25 days after infection.
In most people, mumps is mild. But it can cause serious, long-lasting problems including

  For every question, there’s really an answer, you sometimes just have to spend a little bit more time thinking about it and take a step back and look at what’s actually in front of you.
Luckily, he gets to apply these interests in his work every day. James is a computational chemist – he works with Merck’s chemistry teams, applying predictive modelling to identify ways to design drugs and analyze data to help our scientists prioritize the next compounds to make and test. 
“Although these are complex problems and complex questions that we’re trying to solve, we take logical steps,” explains James. “For every question, there’s really an answer, you sometimes just have to spend a little bit more time thinking about it, and take a step back and look at what’s actually in front of you.”
“In our group’s role in drug discovery, we have this mantra of ‘better molecules, faster,” says James. “If a chemist has 100 compounds that she’s thinking about making, computationally, we can help prioritize which ones to start with based on rational drug design.”
James enjoys being part of a team working to achieve a singular goal: to create medicines that will help the people who need them.  And, he believes that collaboration is very important for research and development: “You can't do a project on your own; you need others to assist and help, not just by contributing in their individual role, but also with their thinking.”
James and his colleagues have a lot of experience with perseverance and determination, too. Our teams of scientists design, develop and screen thousands of compounds and antibodies to ultimately advance only a few of the most promising lead candidates into clinical testing. “Molecular design and development is an iterative process. You have to stick with it. It's continuously making modifications and adapting and evolving, eventually getting down the road or the pipeline to make a drug…that's what's exciting about it.”
“Every day, come to work knowing that I’m working to make a drug. And, don't know if today I’m going to open up an email with results saying, ‘we've accomplished this” or ‘we need to change that.’ But regardless of what those results are, it's going to be progress to get to that end point.”

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
 UCDavis; Ph.D., Stanford University
  We are trying to understand biology in new and different ways to find new targets for drug discovery.
                            What Luis and his fellow researchers are exploring are biologic targets, which are molecular-level mechanisms or receptors that play a role in how cancer cells grow and spread in the body.  As targets are identified, the team then must work to uncover how they work; how they interact at the cellular and molecular level. From this understanding, the teams then work to invent medicines that 'hit' or interact with the targets with the goal of interrupting the growth and spread of cancer cells.  "We are trying to understand biology in new and different ways to find new targets for drug discovery, so innovation and creativity are essential."
Dedicated to finding the 'elusive' targets
                            "am working on a target that we still don't understand everything about — and think that's going to be the case as we go forward with new targets — they're going to be trickier,” Luis comments. “But at the same time, that unknown fuels the passion of trying to uncover and understand new targets."
                            Many tumors remain difficult to target because their biology (aka: how they operate within the complex human system), is not well understood. 
							 "For the targets that still remain elusive, the amount of work that goes into trying to understand those targets — how they contribute to cancer tolerance, how they contribute to regulating the immune system to keep it from fighting that cancer — the amount of work that goes into trying to understand that biology takes years," he notes.  "If you add up all the people that work on a particular program, we're talking about potentially decades of work to uncover a single target."
							Fortunately for Luis, he's not working alone. “The best ideas are an amalgam of thoughts that come together to solve a particular question. work with groups of people who explore cancer biology from different angles, exposing us to new avenues of thought. Combining multiple scientific approaches allows us to be much more creative in how we find answers to the many questions we have in our search for new targets."
                            Luis has worked in Palo Alto for six years and is about to move to our new 
. "The move to San Francisco will open new opportunities for us to work with great minds in many scientific fields that are advancing rapidly right now, including immunology, computational biology, genetics, to name just a few. It really will put us in the center of the action," he notes. “The move will make us more accessible to many experts who can help us address the questions, 'How do we understand cancer better? How can we better target certain cancers?  What patient populations will benefit the most?'"
                            For any exploration to be successful, teamwork and expertise are essential, so Luis and his colleagues often seek input from outside our labs. "The only way for us to facilitate this basic research and sometimes look at it in a different light is to go outside of our immediate teams,'" he notes. "Increasing our accessibility to collaborators in industry and academia, believe will improve our capacity to expand on these questions that we have and hopefully lead to new insights. We may be able to discover new things that we wouldn't have otherwise been able to do on our own."

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
  The people work with have become my family. There's a strong sense of camaraderie, especially within and our neuroscience department. We are a very strong and motivated group of people who are really trying to better the world.
In 2012, Dr. Paige Cramer, along with her team at the Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, made waves in the scientific community which helped land her on Forbes “30 under 30” list (an honor she’s received twice).
And now, after spending four years in Merck’s labs researching neurodegenerative diseases, Paige has a new career adventure on the horizon– this time out of the labs and into our Global Human Health division, the sales and marketing organization for Merck's prescription medicines and vaccines. As an associate director  in the Global/Marketing Department, Paige is putting away the microscope and will pick up a keyboard as she helps communicate to a worldwide audience about our neuroscience research and work.
“It's a huge opportunity,” she says about the move. “My new role will expand  my experience within the neuroscience department while giving me the chance to tackle new and different challenges. And, in the end, I’ll still be able to contribute to my initial mission of delivering new treatment options to patients.”
The transition is one Paige has always wanted, saying when she initially started at she wanted to stay in the labs only a few years and then “see what else is possible.”
This kind of talent development is important at Merck. We believe in helping our employees understand all aspects of our business. This means supporting our workers as they branch out into other areas and departments to learn all they can about how we operate. Career development and flexible career paths are a priority for because we believe that bringing together a diversity of backgrounds, ideas and approaches makes our company stronger.
“recruits top talent.  The people I’ve worked with so far are amazing collaborators and peer leaders. It’s a great place to come to work,” she says, saying that when she initially moved to the Philadelphia region from the Midwest (Ohio), she didn’t know anyone in the area. That quickly changed once she started. “The people work with have become my family. There's a strong sense of camaraderie, especially within and our neuroscience department. We are a very strong and motivated group of people who are really trying to better the world.”
Paige is so invested in Merck, she helped launch the Network for Millennials, a group that focuses on delivering cultural and generational insights across our business and helping all employees connect with the Millennial Generation (those born after 1980 and the first generation to come of age in the new millennium).
“[The group] is still in its infancy, but it's gaining momentum,” she says. “The network is growing and bringing out a lot of great ideas and creative energy. hope we are proving to be a valuable resource for all employees. As I’ve experienced firsthand, really invests in developing and retaining its employees. The Network for Millennials is just one example of the company’s commitment to understanding and appreciating the differences between generations.”

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
 Vice President and Head of Genetics and Pharmacogenomics
 MPH, University of Michigan; M.D., University of Pennsylvania 
  In our labs and across the industry, we are seeing how human genetics can help determine if a patient will respond to a certain medication.
Caroline Fox, is passionate about genetics.
In medical school, she studied the effects of the environment on diabetes and obesity on a tribe of Native Americans  (certain populations worldwide have a greater propensity towards diabetes; this tribe was one such group). Her research left her motivated to learn more about how genetics plays a role in metabolic diseases.  “That was my start,” she notes. “Since then, almost all of my research has been focused on uncovering the genetic foundations of these types of diseases.”
, Caroline worked at the National  Institutes of Health. There, she led a lab that studied metabolic risk factors for  cardiovascular disease as part of the 
, a pioneering  long-term population study of cardiovascular disease. But, she notes, the shift  to was a relatively easy one. “was impressed by Merck’s efforts to leverage  human genetics to drive drug discovery,” she says. “For me, it was the  perfect next step from the work that had been doing in academia.”
We're lucky — Caroline’s passion for genetics is a great fit for Merck.  “In our labs  and across the industry, we are seeing an increased use of human genetics to help  determine whether patients will respond to a certain drug or not," She  points to Merck's active research collaborations with scientists around the world aimed at advancing this field of science. “am very enthusiastic  about where our research may lead.”

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
 Being with his family
  Everybody comes to work from a different place, from a different experience, from a different ethnicity, from a different life experience. They've learned things that you haven't learned. We want to use that unique perspective to further the business, to further our goals, and to enhance the lives and attitudes of everybody we’re working with.
Director Jay Schiller is very open about his disability (he has an artificial arm and leg due to an electrical accident sustained while he was a college student).
“When you have a disability, it’s very easy to not embrace it or hide it. But I’ve always been comfortable with it as well as open to what can and can’t accomplish.”
And, as it turns out, he can accomplish quite a bit.
From a chemistry major to Although Jay admits he may have been “a little naive” about going into chemistry with an artificial arm (as well as only taking a semester off after his accident), he graduated from the University of Delaware with a degree in Chemistry and a vision of working in pharma. Jay now supports early clinical development by analyzing samples from clinical trials of candidate compounds currently in development at Merck.  “In early clinical development, we get to touch most of the molecules that come through drug development. We have direct impact on how quickly results get turned around and information gets supplied to our teams.”
Jay tries to pass on his irrepressible attitude to the students with disabilities he mentors though the 
, a national non-profit that supports disability inclusion in the workplace.
“had a lot of folks in my post-accident life who helped me along the way to show me there weren’t too many things that couldn't do. They really helped me get going and started in my career. People with disabilities don't have enough role models. They just don't.  But once somebody with a disability sees that somebody like them is doing something, it makes it so much easier to be able to accomplish his or her dreams. wanted to be that for somebody else.”
Jay also pays it forward by being active in Merck's capNetwork, which promotes diversity and inclusion for Merck’s employees with disabilities, workers with disabled family members as well as other allies throughout the organization.
Jay is proud to work somewhere with such a strong culture of 
. “Many people have different ideas about what diversity and inclusion means,” he notes. “What it is to me is using your unique perspective at work. Everybody comes to work from a different place, from a different experience, from a different ethnicity, from a different life experience. They've learned things that you haven't learned, that haven't learned. We want to use that unique perspective to further the business, to further the goals, to further your team, to further everybody you're working with. strongly believe that is a company that walks the walk.”

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
“Medicine is for the People – Not for the Profits”
Merck, president and chairman 1925-1957
  We try never to forget that medicine is for the people.
George commitment to inventing scientific solutions to unmet medical challenges…a commitment to patients before profits…and, a deep sense of corporate obligation to the public good. These are the principles George established for the company many years ago, and they continue to guide our company and leaders today.
Creating Merck’s first complete research and development laboratory -- one that was so outstanding that it could “talk on equal terms with the universities and research institutes” -- was a milestone…and not just for the company and George Merck, who initiated and led the effort as Merck’s president. It ushered in a new era in industrial research -- one that fostered collaboration between industry, academia and medical institutions. It was a milestone for researchers both inside and outside of Merck, and, most importantly, for the patients.
An Interdisciplinary Research Approach – The Campus
George made the decision to invest in this world-class R&facility in 1929, in spite of the fact that the country was entering the Great Depression.  He envisioned a place where “science will be advanced, knowledge increased and human life will win a great freedom from suffering and disease.”
At the dedication ceremony in 1933 in Rahway, N.J., he first laid out the company mission to develop scientific breakthroughs to benefit humanity, and then carefully built the team of scientists and strategy of scientific innovation that defines the company.
Known as “The Campus” because of its academic atmosphere and appearance, the new R&facility offered scientists “the greatest possible latitude and scope in pursuing their investigations, the utmost freedom to follow promising scientific results no matter how unrelated to what one would call practical terms” and the freedom to publish. And, it reflected a significant shift in the relationship between business and universities that had been unwilling to endanger their autonomy by working with industry.
According to George Merck, “the new laboratories signified our transition from the more or less individual, isolated scientific effort to modern teamwork. Merck’s collaboration with academic and medical institutions flourished and yielded important pioneering discoveries at that time, among them: vitamins, antibiotics and hormones.
Shift from chemical manufacturer to pharmaceutical company
George guided the company through two decisive mergers. The first, in 1927, was the merger of Powers-Weightman-Rosengarten that more than doubled the company’s sales.  The second, the 1953 merger with Dohme, resulted in a fully integrated, multi-national producer and distributor of pharmaceuticals as well as specialty chemicals.
George indoctrinated the company – and through it, eventually, the industry – with the concept that the public good must be taken into account as a factor in its policies and projects.
“It is up to us in research work, in  industries, and in colleges and other institutions, to help keep the problem in  this focus.  We cannot step aside and say  that we have achieved our goal by inventing a new drug or a new way by which to  treat presently incurable diseases, a new way to help those who suffer from  malnutrition, or the creation of ideal balanced diets on a worldwide  scale.  We cannot rest till the way has  been found, with our help, to bring our finest achievement to everyone.”
This responsibility  was evident when George turned over Merck’s patent rights to the  breakthrough antibiotic for tuberculosis discovered by Dr. Selman Waksman at Rutgers  University with support from Merck, so that this “public-health process” could  be licensed to multiple manufacturersfor the benefit of the many people  suffering and dying from this disease.
Encouraged  by his father to “join the shop” in 1915, George revolutionized  pharmaceutical research and launched some of the most exciting innovations in  Merck’s history.  He was a visionary  whose values and principles  still guide  this company more than 90 years later.
Ken Frazier, chairman and CEO, recently noted, “Our company’s  enduring purpose was captured by George Merck, who said ‘medicine is  for the people, not for the profits.’ It's important for us not only to  discover and develop innovative medicines, but also to make sure that people  have access to those medicines.”
On a quest to cure,  we continue to hold George Merck’s values to the highest standard. Values of  the past guide our vision for a healthier and more hopeful future.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Vice President, Infectious Diseases Discovery and Chief Scientific Officer, Cambridge Exploratory Science Center
B.S., Rutgers University; Ph.D., Stony Brook
  What’s most exciting to me is having the flexibility to explore completely new areas of disease biology, knowing that we have Merck’s proven discovery and development capabilities at hand to drive our discoveries and inventions forward.
There is no secret formula for a successful career in drug discovery, but creativity and the willingness to adapt to a rapidly-changing scientific landscape plays a big role. For Dr. Daria Hazuda,  Vice President of Infectious Diseases Discovery, Research Laboratories, the most valuable trait is tenacity, as most researchers are considered fortunate if they create just one new molecule that makes it through the complex process it takes to become a product.
“When joined over 20 years ago, it was a big eye-opener to see the magnitude of the effort that goes into drug discovery and development,” she notes.  “There are so many different disciplines required to move something from an idea in discovery into development, and then there is so much effort required along the path to approval.”
Daria’s research in infectious disease biology has led to the discovery and development of multiple novel medicines to treat and Hepatitis  But don’t call her success in this field lucky. 
 “Luck may be a factor, sure, but more importantly, you must also learn from the things that don’t work,” she says as she reflects on her experience.  “If you are working on a program, inevitably a lot of the things you try don’t succeed. Instead of chalking those up to failure, use those lessons and apply them to the next iteration of what you are trying to do. It’s a missed opportunity if you don’t learn from what doesn’t work.”
Daria’s advice: “Maintain focus and have flexibility to adapt your research as science and data unfolds.”
With Daria’s extensive experience in the labs (and more than 180 publications focused primarily on antiviral research in the fields of and Hepatitis C), Daria will now apply her expertise as Chief Scientific Officer of the new Research Laboratories Cambridge exploratory science center in Cambridge, Mass. The center will focus on the earliest stages of discovery research to better understand the underlying biology of human disease.
“Our new Cambridge labs present a unique opportunity to tap into the cutting-edge science coming out of the area’s rich biomedical research,” she says of the new exploratory science center.  Designed as an entrepreneurial and intimate environment of roughly 40 scientists, the labs do not focus on tackling a set roster of diseases. Here, the emphasis will be on exploring the most promising areas of emerging disease biology, including host-pathogen biology and the role of the microbiome in disease, and gaining new insights to inform Merck’s ongoing drug discovery.”
Merck’s new labs are located in Cambridge’s Kendall Square neighborhood, home to one of the largest concentrations of biotech and academia in the In addition, the space is shared with Merck’s East Coast Business Development team to support the lab’s focus on early biology and technology collaborations with local academic and biotech groups.
For Daria, expanding our early research capabilities is an exciting and necessary shift for Merck, and a demonstration of our commitment to being “research driven.” 
In a landscape where many large biopharmaceutical companies are exiting the discovery space, she sees these new capabilities as a necessary and vital addition for the company. “There’s a reason for the ‘and’ in Research and Development,” Daria notes.  “You need to have both; you need to have people exploring new areas of biology to uncover new opportunities to interrogate a disease, as well as those who recognize what a good molecule looks like in order to make and successfully deliver a medicine to the market.”
Looking ahead, she adds, “What’s most exciting to me is having the flexibility to explore completely new areas of disease biology, knowing that we have Merck’s proven discovery and development capabilities at hand to drive our discoveries and inventions forward.”

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Austin joins our global family of technology offices in Prague, Singapore and Branchburg, New Jersey, where we engage with top tech minds from across the company, academia, start-ups, and the health care community to develop life-saving health solutions that will drive the core business of our company. 
Operating at the intersection of technology, health care, and the life sciences, we support the invention of novel medicines, broaden access to medicine to the people who need it, and enable care through technology. We have always been and always will be inventing, and we do it for the single greatest purpose: Life.
 How can we help doctors enhance their engagement with patients? 
How can we help our scientists invent more life-saving medicines? 
How can we help streamline our supply and distribution channels? 
To help answer these questions, we came to Austin to partner and co-develop solutions with the local community.
                            We have a 24/7 office strategy at that enables us to support digital
We’ve opened a state-of-the-art office in the heart of Austin. Located within the new medical school campus at the University of Texas (UT), our environment fosters collaboration and creativity in a relaxed atmosphere and supports our goal to have technology help drive Merck’s overall business outcomes. 
In addition to our office at Dell Med, we also have a presence at Capital Factory in downtown Austin.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
What’s so cool about working at is that the problem solving we do, using cutting-edge research and science, results in positive impact to people's lives and their quality of life.”
When you or think about medicine, we may just think about  what lines our bathroom cabinet.
But, medicines actually come in a variety of forms and can  be administered in a variety of ways. And,  while these medicines are very powerful in their ability to heal people from  devastating illnesses, they are also sometimes very fragile in their chemical  stability, impacting their ability to be transported to remote locations while  still maintaining potency. In order to remain effective, they may require  refrigeration or smooth transport -- meaning, they must travel to a clinic or a  hospital or a doctor’s office on paved roads in the safety of an enclosed, cool  truck and not, say, days through dusty, hot terrain in a third world  country.  
As executive director of Merck's Preformulation Group, Jason Cheung plays an important role in making sure our medicines can be manufactured consistently and maintain their stability so that they can get to the patients who need them, where ever in the world they may be.
“Our goal is to build foundational knowledge on mechanisms that maintain product stability and effectiveness.  Understanding these mechanisms supports our ability to deliver innovative medicines across the globe,” explains Jason.
There every step of the journey
Their work begins in the early stages of the research and development journey -- long before our drug candidates are tested as potential medicines in clinical trials -- and continues until they have a product that is suitable for large-/commercial-scale manufacturing.  
“When medicines finally become available to patients, they've already undergone a challenging journey,” he says.   “Our medicines are created either through complex chemistry or by manipulating living cells to express proteins.  In both cases, we start with very small scales and volumes (think mL) and ultimately produce them at scales that are thousands of liters.”
In addition to quantity increases, another challenge for  Jason and his team is figuring out how to maintain quality and stability throughout  the physical journey of our medicines. “We transport these from one lab to  another and from our manufacturing facilities to clinics all over the world  during different moments in testing and trials. And they have to be able to  withstand that kind of movement.”
When  asked if he got into this line of work because he likes to solve problems, Jason doesn’t hesitate. “Oh, think all scientists get into this because they  like to solve problems,” he said, resolutely. “And what’s so cool about working  at is that the problem solving we do, our research using cutting-edge technology and science, results in positive impact to people's lives and their quality of life. It’s a very rewarding experience.”

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
We support public policies that advance the interests of patients, improve public health and promote access to medicines and innovation.
We work to achieve our business objectives responsibly and respond to our many stakeholders' needs and concerns. We support policies that promote the discovery of innovative medicines and vaccines and make these products available to all who need them.
develop policy positions that guide our activities and advocacy on a range of issues;
seek opportunities to adopt industry-leading standards in several areas;
strive to communicate clearly and transparently about our positions; and
work closely with the many groups and individuals who are also trying to address the complex healthcare challenges that confront us.
Corporate Political Contributions and Political Action Committee
is committed to participating constructively in the political process. Government proposals to regulate the health care system may directly affect the Company's business and incentives for pharmaceutical innovation. Also, there are important policy initiatives that can further the company's goals with respect to increasing patient access to medicines and vaccines, and most importantly, to health care insurance coverage. It is appropriate for the Company to help inform the debate on these issues in the United States and in other countries. The primary means by which engages in this debate is by communicating information to government officials. In the United States, Canada and Australia, the Company also provides corporate political contributions, primarily to the electoral campaigns of individual candidates.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
enjoy impacting how other people do scientific research and allowing them to take what we’ve learned and apply it to their own situations and their own problems.”
When Chris Kistler isn’t in the lab evaluating new technologies to help Merck’s bioprocess department, you may find him  at home trying to figure out how to create something a little different: Beer.
“There are quite a bit of similarities between making beer and my work in bioprocessing,” he says.  “In both cases, I’m trying to figure out how to get the most out of a cell to make something of interest. In the home brewing case, that’s beer, and in the work case, that’s a therapeutic protein.”
And what is making a good medicine (or a beer, for that matter) if you don’t share it with the outside world? For Chris, it’s the reciprocation as well as the creativity of both his professional life and his hobbies that makes both so enjoyable.  “big component of my job is doing technology development to improve how we make medicines,” Chris says. “Technology for Merck, of course, but it’s also really fulfilling to put these new technologies out into the world. enjoy impacting how other people do scientific research and allowing them to take what we’ve learned and apply it to their own situations and their own problems.”
Chris especially appreciates sharing his work and research when he attends external conferences and meetings.  “In the past, we were the ones asking the questions, and we were the ones aspiring to work with all of this new, great technology other people were talking about and creating,” he remembers. “Now we have people coming up to us and saying, ‘Hey!  just heard about this new thing you’ve published, that you’ve presented on.  really want to work with you guys on this. Can you tell me more about it? Can we set meetings up?’ It’s a great spot to be in.”

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
  came here because science and innovation drive this company. believe that my best day at work — the day my team makes a potentially life-changing discovery — is still ahead of me. It’s the reason why stay.
Chemistry has been central to our business of 
 since our earliest days as a company. 
Today, new modalities are emerging that show a strong potential to target complex diseases that have not yet been reachable with either small molecules or biologics.
Rob Garbaccio is leading a talented team of chemists who are helping guide Merck’s entry into this exciting new field of medicine. 
Rob is the associate vice president, Chemistry Capabilities for Accelerating Therapeutics (CCAT), a discovery chemistry team that is looking at how to go beyond the traditional methods of discovering and developing medicines.
"There are certain disease targets that are really hard to 'reach' and impact using traditional methods," he notes. "So part of the group oversee tries to figure out how we can employ newer modalities, such as peptides, bioconjugates, and oligonucleotides, to address the challenging targets that are increasingly emerging from biological research."
Rob's group is not focused on any specific therapeutic area -- they are seeking new ways to address the most difficult disease targets. "In oncology, infectious diseases, and neuroscience, for example, we’re looking for those targets that our colleagues say, 'If only we could modulate this target, we believe we might be able to potentially interrupt the disease process and help patients,'" he notes.
It's complex work, to be sure, but that's what makes it so intriguing and inspiring for Rob and his team.
"The thing that like the most about my work is the belief that there may be a path forward for the treatment of each and every one of these diseases. We just can't see it yet because the biology is so complex," says Rob. "As researchers continue to improve our understanding of disease biology, believe that combining that knowledge with creative chemistry will help lead us down new roads to treating disease and helping patients."
Rob joined the company after completing graduate school and a postdoctoral fellowship focusing on organic chemistry. "came here because science and innovation drive this company. I'm passionate about our mission to save and improve lives, and believe that my best day at work, the day my team makes a potentially life-changing discovery, is still ahead of me, and it's the reason that stay."
At Merck, we say we are 
. And Rob definitely sees himself as an inventor. "Chemists have this unique ability to combine atoms and bonds between atoms in a unique way. Every day chemists are inventing hundreds of molecules that have never existed before. So, yes, we are inventing," he says.
"We are inventing to solve problems."
 are small protein chains comprised of 40 or fewer amino acids. Natural peptides include endorphins and growth hormones. Peptide-based medicines can be used to replace or mimic the ability of natural peptides to selectively engage targets.
, “Oligos,” are short, synthesized single-stranded sequences of nucleic acids, designed to bind to a complementary sequence of  
 are formed when two molecules, such as a biologic and a small molecule, are joined together, with the intention of enhancing drug delivery and targeting.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
To have the opportunity to do the research that do day-to-day here as well as the luxury of being able to do research on the International Space Station makes me feel incredibly lucky."
“On Earth, you can control every variable – other than gravity.”
This little nugget of intergalactic wisdom about why conducting medical research aboard the is so exciting is from Tara Ruttley, an associate program scientist for the International Space Station (ISS), during a recent event at Merck. As she explained, it’s mainly because no one really knows what will happen in zero gravity — our usual laws of physics just don’t apply in outer space.  Zero gravity research allows scientists and researchers to study the underlying dynamics of why things work the way they do.
scientist Paul Reichert knows this first hand. He’s been working with and the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space (CASIS) to conduct his own set of zero gravity experiments for aboard the since 1993. Paul, who has carried out 13 experiments, including two onboard the ISS, has one main specialty: growing crystals in space.
Improving our drug discovery, delivery and manufacturing processes
About ten years ago, Paul discovered conditions that crystallize a protein called “alpha interferon.” We’ll let him explain:  “Proteins grown in space behave differently because they are not impacted by the force of gravity, so they tend to grow bigger and purer, allowing us to gain new insights into their 3-structures,” he notes. “Each time I’ve sent an experiment to space, I’ve learned how to grow crystals better here on Earth.”
By making and studying these crystals, Paul and his team can figure out ways  to improve the storage of otherwise structurally-fragile medicines as well as how to devise better methods of drug delivery.
“Currently, a lot of medicines are delivered via an in a hospital setting, usually over several hours,” he explains.  What Paul and his team are trying to figure out is how to transform these medicines into something that can be given as a single, quick injection in a doctor’s office — something someone can receive on their lunch break, whereas before they would have to use a whole day in order to get the medicine they need to take.
So, what does the future hold for this frontier-busting scientist? Hopefully, more experiments and even more breakthroughs. “allows me, every day come to work, to push the frontiers of science,” he notes.  “I’m like a kid in a candy shop here.”
candy shop that just happens to sometimes be in outer space.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
 In the summer of 2015, Jim and Judy Hughes were close to experiencing an empty nest: One daughter was in college and the other would soon be graduating high school. But as Judy remembers," didn't feel like was quite ready for that yet."
Although the couple of 24 years knew they wanted to change something, they didn't know what.  "It was obvious to me that we had something to give, and we could be there for someone," says Judy. It was a feeling that would soon turn into an idea and take on a life of its own, whisking the Hughes far away from their comfortable home in Pennsylvania to an orphanage in Xi’an, China.   
As it happened, a friend of the Hughes had recently begun doing outreach for a Chinese orphanage for older children who needed to be adopted. 
"These children are generally over the age of 10. They are called 'waiting children' as they desperately need a home," says Judy. "In China, you are no longer  adoptable at the age of 14. You'll be on your own."
Their friend shot a number of short advocacy videos of some of these older children in the orphanage and sent two to Judy saying: "Just take a look and see what you think."
And on her laptop, Judy watched a six-minute video, shot thousands of miles away. It's when she first met the boy who would become their son, Dax.
'We are growing our family as a family'
Judy shared the video with Jim. "He thought, 'He seems really cool." Jim’s next thought was, "What do we do to make this happen?"
, who then sent them a packet of information about the child. It contained about 10 pages of everything that was known about Dax… how he was abandoned…how he came to the orphanage... how he was spending his time there, and a bit about his medical background. It also included their best guess at his birthday (when his mother left him, she did not leave any information about him, so the doctors had to guess.)
They had already had their daughters' blessing to bring on a new family member. 
"It was important we did this as a family," says Jim. 
"We saw this as a very unique way to grow a family because we were growing our family as a family; it was not just as something Mom and Dad wanted to do," remembers Judy. In addition to their daughters and their church, there was another support network involved who helped bring Dax come into their lives: Merck. 
"Our local family was able to help us and support us through the whole thing," says Jim, who has worked for for 30 years, most recently as an associate director in Global Security at our West Point plant (Judy is a bit ahead of that milestone; she's worked here for 31 years). "People just come alongside you and say 'How can help? What can do to help you get there?' There was nothing but encouragement."
Merck's family leave benefits provide six weeks of job-protected paid time off to spend with a new child, in addition to 20 weeks of combined unpaid child care leave and (for birth mothers) short-term disability. These benefits apply to employees no matter how one chooses to expand their family: parents through birth, surrogacy, adoption, and foster placement. 
Since the Hughes adopted Dax, financial assistance for adoption has more than doubled, and has been expanded to include surrogacy. 
"[Merck’s benefits] helped us overcome a huge obstacle. Not just the benefits of having friends that were supportive -- you can find that pretty much anywhere you go. But to have the company come back and support us financially and also support us with a leave of absence…it just made me feel like, 'OK, so they really are understanding about what it takes to build a family,'" says Judy.
It's been over a year now since Dax's "gotcha day" (the day when a child is officially adopted into a family). Adjustment is happening and going at its own pace.  
"It took a while for him to get comfortable; it's a huge adjustment to come to a country where you don't know anything and to come into a family where you don't know anybody," says Jim, who has taken on a large role in raising Dax. "He needed time to feel safe in our family."  
Both Jim and Judy say the biggest surprise in bringing Dax home is watching him experience new things. "He's not had many life experiences," says Jim. "But this first year has been very exciting to witness Dax's firsts. His first time going on an airplane. His first time bowling. Seeing the ocean for the first time." Judy smiles. "It's so joyful to think about the opportunities he might not have otherwise had."
Jim echoes this sentiment. "It's definitely an adventure. One I’m so glad we've been able to go on together."
July 2018 update: We're pleased to announce that on July 27th 2018, Dax Hughes officially became a citizen.

"What is most exciting is to be able to invent a new sort of chemical reaction one day, and use it in drug discovery the next day. And that’s just something that doesn’t happen in academia."
“I’m not a person who thinks of that stuff too much,” he says with a laugh. “So apologize while look it up superfast.” 
What he does spend a great deal of time thinking about is much more important: As a principal scientist of chemistry in Catalysis and Automation at Merck, Spencer spends his time figuring out solutions to complex chemistry issues. “Anywhere a chemistry problem comes up, we get involved,” he says. “I’m constantly trying to build new tools which allow us to solve chemistry problems more effectively. The complexity of solving real world problems is just thrilling and it’s a lot of fun.”
Chemistry has always been a vital component of our research and development at Merck, and our commitment to chemistry has always been a part of our company’s deepest traditions. “There aren’t many companies who focus on chemistry as much as we do,” says Spencer. “In fact, many companies just see it as a commoditized resource. But has always championed Chemistry. It’s important; it’s our focus. think Merck’s greatest strength is the fact that we have such strong scientists and a dedication to science,” he says. “It goes all the way from the top of the company down to the bottom.”
Highly innovative, highly rewarding work
For Spencer, his role as a problem-solver is highly innovative, highly rewarding work. “What is most exciting is to be able to invent a new sort of chemical reaction one day, and use it in drug discovery the next day.  And that’s just something that doesn’t happen in academia.  The lag time between someone inventing a reaction in academia and it actually being used in drug development is usually five or ten years.  We can do this in a day.  We can find something new and use it right away.”

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
“as much as needed, for as long as needed..."
								For centuries, river blindness (onchocerciasis) plagued remote communities in Africa, Latin America and Yemen, and there was no answer to this affliction.
								This all began to change in the mid-to-late 1970s, when Dr. William Campbell of Research Laboratories suggested the use of ivermectin (later named Mectizan) for river blindness in humans. Following the breakthrough lab work by Dr. Campbell, another researcher, Dr. Mohammed Aziz, championed the clinical development of Mectizan.  Dr. Aziz led the collaboration with the World Health Organization (WHO) in the early 1980s to design and implement field studies in West Africa that, ultimately, proved the effectiveness of the drug against river blindness.
								In 1987, committed to donate Mectizan - as much as needed for as long as needed - with the goal to help eliminate river blindness.
								In order to reach this goal, leaders recognized that many organizations with unique skills would need to work together as a team. To enable this collaboration, established the 
, a ground-breaking public-private  partnership. Operating from the Atlanta-based Task Force for Global Health, the coordinates technical and operational activities between Merck, WHO, the World Bank, and a range of public and private stakeholders.
								Building on the successful implementation of the river blindness program, in 1998 expanded its commitment to include donating Mectizan for another disease, lymphatic filariasis (LF), also known as elephantiasis, in African countries and Yemen where it co-exists with river blindness.  For LF, Mectizan is administered with albendazole, a drug donated by 
								In November 2017, in support of new guidelines,  announced an expansion of the MECTIZAN® Donation Program (MDP) to reach up to an additional 100 million people per year through 2025 as part of the global effort to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF).
				                More than thirty years later, the results of the speak for themselves. Several countries in Africa are making significant progress towards eliminating both diseases. In Latin America, four countries – Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico and Guatemala – have  received verification of river blindness elimination. Both river blindness and lymphatic filariasis are on WHO’s list of neglected tropical diseases targeted for elimination globally.
								Today, the is the longest-running, disease-specific drug donation program of its kind and has been influential in the development of a number of other drug donation programs. And, the MDP's community-directed strategy used to distribute Mectizan has enabled add-on health services to be introduced in remote communities where health services are limited.  The program reaches more than 250 million people in the affected areas annually, with more than 2 billion treatments donated since 1987.
								“Who would have thought when that donation was first announced in 1987 that we would be talking of eliminating a disease due to donated Mectizan," said Adrian Hopkins, head of the and Member of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his humanitarian service. "Mectizan is able to impact the life and economy of these communities."
One of the leading causes of preventable blindness worldwide.
Transmitted through the bite of black flies - which live and breed near fast-flowing streams and rivers - and can cause intense itching, permanent skin and eye lesions and, over time, blindness.
It has historically been prevalent in remote rural areas of 36 countries (in Africa, Latin America, and in Yemen).
Also known as elephantiasis, results in disfiguring swelling in the limbs and genitals.
Parasitic infection spread by mosquitoes and damages the human lymphatic system.
More than 1.3 billion people are at risk, and 30 percent of those infected live in Africa.

 According to Uche Amazigo, former director of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control, 
"by engaging the people, the treatment coverage increased significantly."
People in the communities are an integral part of the distribution process in the more than 146,000 communities where Mectizan has been distributed.
Explore our more than 30-year history of helping to bring treatment to those afflicted by river blindness and elephantiasis.
Dr. William Campbell of Research Laboratories suggests the use of Mectizan (ivermectin) against onchocerciasis (river blindness) in humans.
The first human clinical trials begin in Dakar with the first patient receiving a single dose.
Former Dr. Roy Vagelos announces the company's commitment to donate Mectizan to treat river blindness for as long as needed - the Mectizan Donation Program (MDP) is formed.
The Mectizan Expert Committee meets for the first time to establish the strategy for distribution and  the donation review process.  Mectizan has been produced at the plant in Haarlem, the Netherlands, since the beginning of the program.
Merck, the Secretariat and establish the Non-Governmental Development Organization (NGDO) Coordination Group for Onchocerciasis Control. NGDOs play a critical role in Mectizan distribution through their work with ministries of health and local communities, expertise in program management, and financial support.
The Onchocerciasis Elimination Program for the Americas (OEPA), formed by the River Blindness Foundation and currently sponsored by The Carter Center, brings together the ministries of health of six countries in Latin America affected by onchocerciasis.
WHO, the World Bank, international NGOs, and 19 African countries partner to create the African Program for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC), providing a structure for financial support and coordination of river blindness control efforts.

and the celebrate the 100 millionth treatment in Uganda.
The Pan American Health Organization passes a resolution calling for the interruption of transmission of river blindness in the Americas by the year 2012.
confirms the potential for elimination of river blindness in some parts of Africa through current treatment strategies.
reaffirms its commitment to the “will continue to [donate Mectizan] until river blindness becomes a disease of the past,” said Richard Clark, former chairman and CEO.
Colombia becomes the first country to apply for certification for the elimination of onchocerciasis transmission after suspending treatment with Mectizan in 2007.
Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Frazier commemorates the 25th anniversary of the at a celebratory event in London.
The World Health Organization verifies that Colombia has eliminated onchocerciasis, thus becoming the first country in the world to achieve this goal.
The World Health Organization verifies the elimination of onchocerciasis in Ecuador. Ecuador worked in partnership with the Donation Program and a number of other organizations and now becomes the second country in the world to be free of this disease.
The World Health Organization verifies the elimination of onchocerciasis in Mexico, the third country in the world to be free of river blindness.
									Dr. William Campbell, Ph.D., is jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of avermectin, which led to a treatment for river blindness. Dr. Campbell performed his Nobel Prize-winning work at Research Laboratories in Rahway, N.J., where he worked from 1957 until his retirement in 1990.
The World Health Organization verifies the elimination of onchocerciasis in Guatemala thanks to a partnership with the Donation Program and a number of other organizations. With this milestone, four of the six countries in the Americas historically at-risk for river blindness now have verified elimination of the disease.
Togo becomes the first country in Africa recognized by the World Health Organization to have eliminated lymphatic filariasis (LF) as a public health problem.
 announces an expansion of the MECTIZAN® Donation Program (MDP) to reach up to an additional 100 million people per year through 2025 as part of the global effort to eliminate lymphatic filariasis (LF).
Over 30 years later, the results of this program speak for themselves.
Through the efforts of a variety of partners, more than 2.9 billion treatments have been donated to more than 146,000 communities in 29 countries in Africa, six countries in Latin America, and in Yemen.  River blindness transmission has been interrupted - meaning no new cases have been identified - in four of the six affected countries in Latin America and regions in five African countries. The program reaches approximately 300 million people annually.
Today, the is the longest-running, disease-specific drug donation program of its kind. 
We are humbled by the great work of the alliance of partners to protect future generations from a disease that carries devastating implications for people, families, healthcare systems and local economies.

How Will You Invent the Future?
My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
                            post-antibiotic era – in which common infections can become more deadly – is a very real possibility for the 21st century.
Antibiotics have revolutionized medicine in many respects, and countless lives have been saved; their discovery was a turning point in human history. For almost a century, bacteria-fighting drugs known as antibiotics have helped to manage many of the harmful bacteria that can make us sick. But in recent decades, they have become less effective against some types of bacteria. Currently, certain bacteria are now unbeatable with today’s medicines. Unfortunately, new drug-resistant “superbugs” have emerged, which are strains of bacteria that are resistant to several types of antibiotics. In fact, the World Health Organization has classified this as “a serious threat [that] is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone, of any age, in any country.” 
By 2050, if the problem continues unabated, it is estimated that resistant infections could kill approximately 10 million people per year
, according to a major report by economist Jim O'Neill. These antibiotic-resistant bacteria can threaten the community with new infectious diseases that are more difficult to cure and more expensive to treat. Treating once curable infections might become difficult or even impossible.
While resistance is increasing, is one of only a handful of pharmaceutical companies that have an active antimicrobial discovery program.
For more than 80 years, has contributed to the discovery and development of novel medicines and vaccines to help combat infectious disease. In the 1940s, we were the first to mass produce penicillin for the war effort. And, in 2015, we acquired Cubist Pharmaceuticals, augmenting Merck's strong foundation and opportunity for growth in the hospital acute care market.
The rise in infections that are resistant to current antibiotics has become one of the world’s most pressing public health problems. We are proud to reaffirm our long-standing commitment to develop new therapeutics to fight infectious diseases, and to continue to collaborate with others to support antimicrobial stewardship to help slow the rate of emerging resistance.
Antibiotic·resistant infections can happen anywhere. Data show that most happen in the general community; however, most deaths related to antibiotic resistance happen in healthcare settings, such as hospitals and nursing homes.
According to the World Health Organization, antibiotic resistance refers specifically to the resistance to antibiotics that occurs in common bacteria that cause infections. Antimicrobial resistance is a broader term, encompassing resistance to drugs to treat infections caused by other microbes as well, such as parasites (e.g., malaria), viruses (e.g., HIV) and fungi (e.g., Candida).

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Our discovery scientists “strive to make the impossible possible,” says Joe Miletich. And he should know: As the senior vice president of Discovery Preclinical and Early Development, he leads a team of researchers who are charged with making things “possible that weren’t possible before.” He continues: “At Merck, we believe drug discovery is foundational for us to continue bringing critical medicines to the world.”
About 12,000 people are involved in scientific research at Merck. Our R&colleagues are located across the country — from Massachusetts to New Jersey to Pennsylvania to California — but they are all tasked with the same mission: to solve the puzzles of human disease biology and then translate those findings into new therapies for patients. They are driven to push the boundaries of science and to then transform their discoveries into meaningful new therapeutics.
We're inspired to invent medicines and vaccines to help address the health challenges faced by so many.
think we always have a sense of urgency,
 says Daria Hazuda, vice president of Infectious Diseases and Vaccines Discovery, and chief scientific officer of our recently launched Cambridge Exploratory Science Center. 
We’re always driven to push the envelope, to push the frontier, to do something that nobody’s ever done before.
The ‘inspiration to invent’ remains our driving passion – and a proven path to dramatic advances in human health.
Our teams never shy away from the hard work and many years it takes to invent a molecule with the potential to change the course of a disease - and a person's life. And that’s one reason why a commitment to unparalleled scientific research – to discovery and invention – remains at the heart of our business.
people are involved in R&They share a commitment to turn breakthrough science into meaningful therapeutic options for patients.
We continue to invest in discovery because the world needs cures. We see it as our responsibility to invent solutions that fundamentally transform the future of human health.  Watch the video to learn more about what drives our discovery researchers.

An interview with Dr. Sam Engel, associate vice president, diabetes, endocrinology and women's health, Research Laboratories
Type 2 diabetes is a chronic, progressive disease characterized by the presence of abnormally high blood sugar levels. It develops due to both genetics and lifestyle choices, and occurs as a result of the body being unable to make and/or use insulin effectively.
What is the prevalence of
 diabetes in the U.S.? 
Today, more than 30 million people in the are living with diabetes, and 90-95% have type 2 diabetes. The disease is so prevalent that chances are you know someone who has diabetes. Moreover, if current trends continue, it is estimated that about one in three American adults could have diabetes by 2050.
A1C, a measure of the average level of blood sugar over the past two to three months, helps you and your doctor see how well your diabetes treatment plan is working. The recommended A1goal for many adults with type 2 diabetes is less than 7%; however, this may vary depending on the individual.
High blood sugar levels over time can put people with diabetes at risk of many serious health problems, such as heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness and nerve problems. That’s why it is important for people living with diabetes to work with their doctor to set individualized goals and develop a personalized diabetes management plan to manage the ABCs of diabetes:  for A1C, for blood pressure and for cholesterol.
Helping patients with type 2 diabetes achieve blood sugar control is fundamental. However, having worked in clinical practice for over two decades, know first-hand how challenging it can be for some patients to achieve blood sugar control. In fact, about one-third of adults with type 2 diabetes are not at their A1goal, so we have work to do.
What other aspects of blood sugar
Many people with diabetes are aware of the importance of controlling high blood sugar by diet, exercise and taking medicine (if prescribed), but they may not know that their blood sugar can also get too low. This is known as hypoglycemia, which can make people feel shaky, dizzy, sweaty, faint or hungry. People with diabetes should be sure to tell their doctor if they experience any signs or symptoms of high blood sugar or low blood sugar. Changes to their meal plan, physical activity or diabetes medicine may need to be discussed.
Do you believe that progress is
 being made in the fight against
For more than 10 years, I’ve had the privilege of working for Merck, where we are committed to helping patients with type 2 diabetes. The fight against diabetes is not an easy undertaking, but am confident that important progress is being made and am proud to be part of a team that is committed to helping patients with diabetes achieve their A1goals.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
While employee Dave Hull wanted to stand up to cancer, he wasn't sure he'd ever have full mobility again after a diagnosis of sarcoma in his left sciatic nerve, which affected his ability to stand and walk.
My treatment began with chemo and radiation followed by surgery that resulted in a complete resection of my sciatic nerve. lost all function from the knee down and in my hamstring and other hip flexor/abductor muscles. also lost sensation in my foot and the back of my leg up through my left buttocks," explains Dave. "After additional chemo treatments, was finally declared cancer free in April 2010. My next battle was to regain use of my leg.
Today, after years of physical therapy, Dave has regained some mobility in his leg, but continues to wear a brace from the knee down.
like to believe that my limp is close to imperceptible at this point- and after significant time on crutches and also using a cane to get around - am extremely pleased with the progress I've made with my gait and mobility today.
Which is good, because Dave has a busy life. He and his wife Denise have two pre-teen children, James and Kate, and a golden retriever, Ginger, and Dave's on the go for most of the day. 
“get up early, meditate and go to the gym before heading into the office. But, after work and weekends are all about family time,”
Dave’s inspiring journey with cancer will be featured in the 
 telecast airing nationally on September 7th. The telecast raises money for SU2C's innovative cancer research programs to get new effective treatments to patients faster.
is the Founding Collaborator supporting SU2Catalyst, a program that uses funding and materials from the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, diagnostic and medical devices industries to accelerate research on cancer prevention, detection and treatment. Four SU2Catalyst clinical trial teams focused on sarcoma and ovarian, pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancers are supported by Merck.
Dave was able to continue working while receiving his treatments, thanks in large part, to the support of and his colleagues.
"My family and had an amazing experience with my colleagues throughout my diagnosis and treatment. Sean Bauer, who is now my manager, organized a 'ride schedule' where different members of the team would drive me to and from my chemotherapy infusions. He also organized a meal donation and housecleaning schedule which really helped," recalls Dave. "My kids were 1 and 3 when was diagnosed - so my wife really had her hands full! don't know how we would have done it without my colleagues' support."
Being able to work throughout his treatments was tremendously positive for Dave mentally. "It helped me feel 'normal' and kept my mind engaged and focused on something other than my diagnosis and treatment. could bring work to my chemo infusions and was still a very productive employee throughout it all. That was a huge boost to my psyche."
Dave often meets with other people who have loved ones dealing with a cancer. "try to support them as much as can because know what a difference it can make in this daily fight."
Dave is now training for a 3 mile open water swim in Baltimore thanks to Merck’s partnership with 
, a charitable organization dedicated to raising funds for cancer research and clinical trials. "swim 2-3 days per week and lift twice per week, and it feels good to be back in the pool. swam competitively in high school but have not been swimming regularly since then - and while the loss of function in my leg still affects my stroke - have figured out how to make it work."
Dave has been cancer-free for more than 8 years and is making every day count by being fully committed to his family, work and community activities.
“am swimming to honor those who have fought and lost much more than have – and to encourage those who continue their battles.”

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Balance at Merck's efforts help all employees, including working parents and caregivers, care for themselves and their families as they strive to reach their personal and professional goals.
The important work of our employees doesn’t start or end with the business day. We are mothers and fathers, siblings and children, friends and neighbors...Providing employees with benefits and policies to help achieve a healthy work-life balance is critical for our company.
At Merck, we believe that when we offer a supportive workplace, our employees can accomplish anything. 
Sometimes women need the help and advice of other women to help them achieve the impossible. So we asked a few employees: “What’s the best advice you’ve received about achieving career success?”
Flexibility, balancing work and life, the chance to have a family that they’ve always dreamed of…hear from a few dads on why is a great place to work.
is honored to have been on the Working Mother’s 100 Best Companies list for over 30 years. We are thrilled to be on the inaugural Working Mother’s Best Companies for Dads list, too. These lists recognize companies that set the standard for mom-friendly and dad-friendly work places.  
It’s amazing what people can accomplish when their workplace has their back. From guilt-free downtime, to peace of mind knowing loved ones are taken care of while at work, is there for their employees.
The work we do is too important—inventing new medicines and vaccines to save and improve lives— and the cause is too demanding for anything less than the best.
We make sure our employees can bring it, every hour, every day at work or at home. Here’s how:
family-leave assistance which provides six weeks of job-protected paid time off to spend with a new child
 and back-up child care, to financial planning, and employee discount programs.
Merck’s Adoption/Surrogacy Assistance Program
This provides reimbursement of up to $25,000 of eligible adoption and/or surrogacy-related expenses per child, per family, for adoptions and the birth of a child through a third-party surrogate.
 is designed to support the advancement of women into senior leadership. For future leaders, our 
 and our company’s CEO-sponsored Global Management Acceleration Program develop employees at all levels and stages of their careers.
The majority of our sites offer on-site health clinics which provide an array of medical services. We also 
offer access to on-site fitness centers at many of our offices around the world
 that allows employees to be close to their children during the work day. We also provide tuition discounts to several national childcare providers.
, an organization with expertise in guiding families about important educational issues.
Paid time-off for volunteering
Every day, somewhere in the world, a employee is doing something to give back to the community via our volunteer program, 
.  Each year, we grant 40 hours paid time-off for employees to volunteer at the eligible nonprofit organization of their choice.
For more than a century, we’ve worked in service of humanity
. As leaders.  As pioneers.  As working parents.  We are transforming lives through a culture of spirited collaboration and applied inquiry. We work relentlessly to improve health outcomes for countless people around the world—yesterday, today, and tomorrow. 
employees Jim and Judy Hughes used Merck’s family leave / adoption assistance when they adopted their son Dax from China in 2016. “To have a company come back and support us financially and also support us with a leave of absence…it just made me feel like, 'OK, so they really are understanding about what it takes to build a family,'" says Judy.
Interested in joining our team?
Why Merck? Because we are:
committed to fostering development and rewarding talent
dedicated to diversity and inclusion at every level of our organization
adeptat recognizing unique skill sets and nurturing our employees' talents

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
 in Chemistry, Millsaps College, Jackson MS; Ph.in Analytical Chemistry, University of Cincinnati
 Doing arts and crafts with her daughters, golfing with her husband, and traveling with her family
job at is not just a job, it's a career. Many people are here for the long-term because develops you as a person, as a scientist, and it develops your career down the road. The company has a commitment to you and to your future."
As director of Analytical Method Development for the Biologics BioProcess Development group, Daisy Richardson is the first to admit her role is one that’s a bit more behind-the-scenes. 
“My parents, neither of whom are scientists, ask me all the time what do,” she says with a laugh. “You never really think about drug quality and safety. People always assume there is some control over it, but they don’t realize the complexity behind it. But there’s this incredible intricacy behind the molecules in the vial or syringe of medicine they are receiving. It needs to be safe and consistent.”
Daisy oversees a team which creates tests to monitor the quality of the medicines that manufactures. “It’s a big responsibility,” she notes. “Sometimes these tests  might have a lifetime of 20 or 30 years. So you need to have a vision to make sure continues to make products which remain safe and consistent during that time span.”
Daisy strives to be a role model for other women in her department, as well as for her two young daughters.  “It’s wonderful how many strong, female leaders there are in my department. And think that speaks a lot to and their investment to women in science,” she notes.
Having so many female colleagues is a bit of a novelty for the Mississippi native, who says there were very few women in the science disciplines as she was progressing through school. “was the only girl in my physics class in college, and once was told by my professor, ‘You can take the notes because you are the woman and you can be the secretary.’  There just weren’t a lot of female role models. So, to me, being a role model is something that drives me.”
That responsibility starts at home. “My two girls are my biggest sources of motivation to come to work every day,” she says. “It’s really important for me to set a good example, and to show my kids that women can be in science.  Women can be leaders in science, and they can be technically strong, and they can succeed.”
For now, Daisy’s oldest daughter seems to be following in her mom’s footsteps.  “My oldest daughter, who is four, is able to sign up for ‘elective’ classes at her daycare. And she always signs up for the science class,” recalls Daisy.  “The other day she came home, ran up to me and said, ‘Mommy! Look at me! I’m a scientist!’ And she was so happy.”

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Sixty years ago, in 1958, Dr. Rosalind Franklin died following a two-year fight with ovarian cancer. She was only 37-years-old. Her pioneering research provided the key to deciphering the structure and function of – and ultimately the blueprint for life. 
Interested in joining Scot in our mission
In 1962 her collaborators, James Watson, Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize for their “discoveries concerning the molecular structure of nucleic acids and its significance for information transfer in living material.” Franklin’s untimely death denied her the acclaim of this prestigious scientific award (the Nobel Committee does not award the prize posthumously), but her role in this fundamental discovery has been well documented and is now widely recognized.
Franklin’s story of a life cut short by ovarian cancer remains all too common. Even today, advanced ovarian cancer remains one of the most difficult cancers to treat with only about one-third (29 percent) of patients with metastatic ovarian cancer surviving five years after diagnosis. By contrast, when the cancer is caught early, before it has spread, the odds of surviving at least five years after diagnosis are much better. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of women are diagnosed at an early stage.
There remains a reason for optimism. The pace of change in cancer treatment has increased dramatically in recent years. Advances in research – many of which may be traced back to Franklin’s work – have given us a deeper understanding of how to target the disease, paving the way for new developments. Specific to ovarian cancer, recent clinical research has shown promise for women with advanced stages of the disease.
It is estimated that 22,240 Americans will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2018.
Ovarian cancer often has no symptoms in the early stages and is generally diagnosed after it has spread to other parts of the body. 
In the U.S., ovarian cancer accounts for more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive system.
About half of all American women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer are 63 years or older.
At Merck, we are focused on translating breakthrough science into oncology therapeutics that have the greatest potential for improving long-term disease control and survival for patients, including those with ovarian cancer. We recognize that no two patients or cancers are the same and multiple approaches – therapeutic regimens and mechanisms of action – will be needed to outpace this disease. That’s why we have worked rigorously to expand and diversify our own internal research programs. 
There is still work to be done, but we believe strongly in our potential to transform the way all cancers are treated. And we are constantly inspired to work harder by stories like Rosalind Franklin’s.

Point of View by Eric Rubin, M.D.
post-antibiotic era – in which common infections can become more deadly – is a very real possibility for the 21st century.
Antibiotics have revolutionized medicine in many respects,  and countless lives have been saved; their discovery was a turning point in  human history. For almost a century, bacteria-fighting drugs known as  antibiotics have helped to manage many of the harmful bacteria that can make us  sick. But in recent decades, they have become less effective against some types  of bacteria. Currently, certain bacteria are now unbeatable with today’s medicines.  Unfortunately, new drug-resistant “superbugs” have emerged,  which are strains of bacteria that are resistant to several types of  antibiotics. In fact, the World Health Organization has classified this as “a  serious threat [that] is no longer a prediction for the future, it is happening  right now in every region of the world and has the potential to affect anyone,  of any age, in any country.” 
Why the global concern? By 2050, if the problem continues  unabated, it is estimated that resistant infections could kill approximately 10 million people per year,  according to a major report by economist Jim O'Neill. These  antibiotic-resistant bacteria can threaten the community with new infectious  diseases that are more difficult to cure and more expensive to treat. Treating  once curable infections might become difficult or even impossible.
While resistance is increasing, the number of new  antimicrobial medicines being developed has decreased over the past several  years. is one of only a handful of pharmaceutical companies that still  have an active antimicrobial discovery program.         
For more than 70 years, has contributed to the  discovery and development of novel medicines and vaccines to help combat  infectious disease. In the 1940s, we were the first to mass produce penicillin  for the war effort.  Merck’s recent  acquisition of Cubist Pharmaceuticals, a global leader in antibiotics, underscores our ongoing commitment to advancing the  research and development of new therapies to treat serious and life-threatening  infections. 
“The rise in infections that are  resistant to current antibiotics has become one of the world’s most pressing  public health problems,” said Julie Gerberding, M.D., M.P.H., executive vice president chief patient officer, Merck.  “We are proud to reaffirm our long-standing commitment to develop new  therapeutics to fight infectious diseases, and to continue to collaborate with  others to support antimicrobial stewardship to help slow the rate of emerging  resistance.” 
What is the difference between antibiotic and antimicrobial resistance?
According to the World Health Organization, antibiotic resistance refers specifically to the resistance to antibiotics that occurs in common bacteria that cause infections. Antimicrobial resistance is a broader term, encompassing resistance to drugs to treat infections caused by other microbes as well, such as parasites (e.g. malaria), viruses (e.g. HIV) and fungi (e.g. Candida).
Antibiotic-resistant infections can happen anywhere. Data show that most happen in the general community; however, most deaths related to antibiotic resistance happen in healthcare settings, such as hospitals and nursing homes.
Merck’s acquisition of Cubist Pharmaceuticals bolsters our strong foundation in antibiotics and our future in the hospital acute care market.
What can we do to avoid the generation of resistance?

“When we think of our own families, we know that even one preventable death is absolutely unacceptable.” — Ken Frazier
Five years ago, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon  launched “Every Woman, Every Child,” an unprecedented global initiative to address the major health challenges facing women and children around the  world. “Every Woman, Every Child” pulled together the resources and assistance  of a diverse array of collaborators — from governments, corporations,  community organizations, philanthropic foundations, the healthcare workforce,  and academics among others — to focus on the health of women and children, especially during  childbirth and in the first few hours and days afterwards when they are the  most vulnerable.
On  Tuesday, March 10, the Secretary-General presented the progress report for “Every  Woman, Every Child” at the Headquarters. The advances were promising: Since  1990, maternal deaths have been cut by almost half with 17,000 fewer children deaths  each day. And since 2010 alone, 2.4 million women’s and children’s lives have  been saved.  As noted in Mr. Ki-moon’s  forward in the report, “[These numbers] demonstrate what can be achieved when  we work as a community with a focus on partnership, accountability and  innovation.”
Mr. Ki-moon was joined on stage by  Chairman and Ken Frazier; Ms.  Melinda Gates, co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Mr. Martin Chungong, Secretary  General of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, among others. Together, they shared  their progress on  reducing maternal and infant mortality, as well as the work that still needs to  be done. 
“Public-private  partnerships are one of the most promising ways to help stop the tragedy of  women dying giving life,” said Mr. Frazier, who noted  that although 
 has pledged $500  million over 10 years to help eradicate maternal mortality, more needs to be  done. “believe that these commitments must go beyond dollars, important as  funding is,” he said. “truly believe that the private sector has both the  obligation and the opportunity to share its skills and knowledge to help solve  some of the world’s most daunting health care problems.”   
During  his remarks, Mr. Frazier included several advancements from the for  Mothers program, including: 
Helping to improve access to quality  maternal health care and family planning services for an estimated 3.5 million  women in 30 countries in just three-and-a-half years.                  
Watching maternal mortality ratios in  targeted areas fall by 30 and 35 percent respectively with Merck’s partners in  Uganda and Zambia.                  
Scaling up of an innovative supply  chain model to increase access to family planning methods through Merck’s  partnership with the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation in Senegal.  Thus far, we have achieved 64 percent  national coverage, enabling approximately 1,000 health facilities to serve over  2.6 million women.
  continues to be steadfastly committed to helping ensure women and their  families around the world have every chance possible to live healthy, happy,  fulfilling lives. As Mr. Frazier noted in his closing remarks, “We have come a  long way but there is still much to be done. We must never lose our focus on  the health of mothers and children. When we think of our own families, we know  that even one preventable death is absolutely unacceptable.”                  
Through our 10-year, $500 million 
 initiative,  we are working in more than 30 countries, including the U.S., to decrease the  number of women who die or suffer from severe complications related to  pregnancy and childbirth.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Meet Commander Adam Scott, who came to through the Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellows program, which pairs military officers with organizations in a variety of industries.
 during his recent fellowship at Merck, Navy Commander Adam Scott was still able to find some excitement (as well as insight) while here.
One of many things that impressed me about is the incredible focus on talent management and the significant investment makes in developing its people.
“I've been the mission commander, an aircraft commander, and an air-refueling pilot and instructor pilot for the 
, among other roles.  The Navy trusts young naval aviators with an incredible amount of responsibility. In my role as a mission commander, I've flown missions all over the world with some of the best crews on the planet. As an aircraft commander, was responsible for the safe operation of the aircraft as well as the well-being of my crew. loved being an instructor pilot; enjoy teaching people and helping them apply their book-smarts into practice (instructed in the 
, as well). I’ve also been a test pilot, which lets me test and improve the newest equipment before it goes to the fleet.”
Commander Scott came to through the Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellows program, which pairs military officers with organizations in a variety of industries. Adam is Merck’s fourth fellow, joining our Global Security Group under the mentorship of Grant Ashley, who is Merck’s vice president of Global Security and Aviation, and Allen Phelps, Merck’s director of Intellectual Property and Trade Secret Protection. The Global Security Group helps to protect Merck's physical and intellectual property, as well as our workers.
Over the course of Adam’s nine months with Merck, he gained insights into a variety of areas within the company, including learning how protects our intellectual property and trade secrets, how project management works within our research laboratories, account management and contract negotiations as well as how to conduct internal audits.
“When applied to the Corporate Fellows Program, wanted to gain different perspectives as well as learn about an organization from the inside out,” he explained.
What struck me was how many similarities there are between and the military – they are both global
in nature and significant emphasis is placed on diversity and talent development while living by a set of high
Next up for Commander Scott will be a position back in the Navy, leading a team who will be responsible for setting up the depot and intermediate maintenance capabilities for the Navy's new maritime patrol aircraft, the P-8A, known as “The Poseidon.” “The team's budget is about a billion dollars over the next three years,” he notes. “hope to bring everything I’ve learned at into helping me lead this team.”
Although doesn’t hire employees from the Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellows program, we do partner with a variety of organizations like the Chamber of Commerce’s 
 program to help staff veterans. These initiatives not only help to identify talent for Merck, but also allows our company to provide opportunities for those who served.

Alzheimer's is a progressive disease where dementia symptoms gradually worsen over a number of years. In its early stages, memory loss is mild, but with late-stage Alzheimer's, individuals lose the ability to carry on a conversation and respond to their environment.
Millions of Americans have Alzheimer's disease. This number will grow each year as the size and proportion of the population age 65 and older continue to increase. The number will escalate rapidly in coming years as the baby boom generation ages.
By mid-century, it's projected that someone in the will develop the disease every 33 seconds.
“Even though Dr. Alzheimer characterized the disease in 1906, it wasn’t until the last few decades that the disease became recognized as a real illness separate from normal aging and other forms of dementia,” said Darryle Schoepp, Ph.D., vice president and therapeutic area head, Neuroscience, Merck. 
“Now people are living longer, and we can see how the disease works,” said David Michelson, M.D., vice president, Clinical Neuroscience Research, Merck. “Science is at a place where not only do we understand more about it, but we are exploring ways to do something about it.”
“New technologies are allowing the identification of early disease signs which we hope will allow us to intervene promptly in order to slow or halt progression. That’s the holy grail. What you want to do is to have something that works and to be able to use it before the disease robs people of who they really are,” said Dr. Michelson.
                                Advances in Alzheimer’s are possible because thousands have participated in 
 and other studies to learn more about the disease and test potential treatments.
 initiative are helping link people who have the disease to specific clinical trials.
Today, at least 70,000 volunteers are urgently needed to participate in more than 150 active clinical trials and studies in the that are testing ways to understand, treat or prevent Alzheimer's disease.
As the journey toward finding a medical solution continues in the worldwide research community, the path forward for current Alzheimer’s disease patients and caregivers remains difficult.
That makes the efforts by many organizations, companies and individuals to raise awareness and offer support even more important.
     Understanding how Alzheimer’s disease impacts the patient and the caregiver allows us to raise awareness, to remove some of the stigma and to give people more hope that we can get through this together,
Finding the resources and support to manage Alzheimer's disease is one of the key steps in coping with the disease. Here are links to a few of the resources available:

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
 B.S., Muhlenberg College; Ph.D., University of Pennsylvania 
  My first-hand experience with neurological diseases gives me the passion and motivation to go out and try to tackle really hard questions.
For Angela Jablonski, Ph.D., the fight against Alzheimer's disease is a personal one. 
"People very close to me developed dementia and Alzheimer's disease, and it was extremely hard to watch their struggles – not being able to do their regular activities or remember names, memories or loved ones," she recalls. "When a disease targets the brain, it takes away a part of our identity and our memory --  what makes us 
Angela says that her personal experiences with loss and diseases like Alzheimer’s forced her to look inside herself. "asked myself why these things were happening, and couldn’t answer that question.  But believe those experiences and witnessing the pain it caused gave me the passion and motivation to tackle challenging neurological diseases. My family’s struggles are why get up in the morning and keep going."
Choosing the Postdoctoral Research Fellow program
Angela originally came to after graduating from the University of Pennsylvania to participate in our 
"With the postdoc, was able to experience drug discovery first hand, versus taking a class or reading about it in a book. knew that if came to Merck, if made an important discovery, it would be here, with people who can really turn an idea into a therapy or a target for a new drug or a new treatment for a disease. That's why picked Merck."
In her two years working in the rotation, Angela says she was encouraged to publish and travel to present her work. "While a postdoc, got to do research that was pushed to publish and share on an international level. was able to go to Ireland to present at a prestigious conference for my field and interact with people who are considered the world's experts on neurodegenerative diseases. was proud to share my research with them. gave me the opportunity to travel, see the world and meet outstanding scientists from multiple backgrounds."
Now with her postdoc completed, Angela has decided to stay on at as a senior scientist, working on neurological diseases in our West Point labs.  "Looking back, couldn't have made a better decision than to come to Merck. It was the right one. I'm glad took the opportunity when it came. look back just at the short time I've been here and I'm already a better scientist, I'm a better person, and I'm a better employee."

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
                          This Veterans Day, we’re proud to highlight one of our employees with an extensive military background: Lieutenant Commander Will Bowden of the Coast Guard Reserve, who has served in the military for the past 18 years.
Will served four years in the Navy as a military police  officer. After the Navy, he transitioned to the Coast Guard Reserve, where he  is currently serving today as the lieutenant commander assigned to Pacific  Command responsible for policy and relations with Northeast Asia. 
His role at is a bit more business-like: Will is an associate director, Women’s Health Marketing. And although it would seem that there would be multiple  differences between his military and corporate lives, Will swears he is constantly  surprised by the similarities. “There have been times when literally have to  look down and see if I’m wearing a suit or a Coast Guard uniform because the  discussion am having had already occurred in the other organization,” he  says. “The parallels between the military and business worlds are infinite.”
Will credits his military background for helping him to conquer any obstacles in his corporate life he may come across.  “Preparing for ambiguity is an art learned  in the military and embrace at Merck,” he says “Remain calm, for the answer is always within reach.”
Three quick questions with Lieutenant Commander Will Bowden of the Coast Guard Reserve
Name a skill that you think is highly underrated in business today.
                        completely different perspective. This is something that is appreciated and encouraged but not always readily found. Holding onto a different perspective or an ability to see things differently is something that has to be nourished and practiced, and, like anything else, we need to develop and command in life.
What is a misconception about the Coast Guard? 
                        After the hurricanes, everyone asked me the same questions – “Are you going to Texas, Florida or Puerto Rico.” think it is an intuitive question to ask anyone in the Coast Guard. However, in my case, had actually been recalled to Pacific Command to work on strategy related to North Korea. Most people think of the Coast Guard as focusing on Drug Interdiction and Search and Rescue. And, while those missions are a huge part of what the Coast Guard does, we are also involved in literally every type of mission around the world, ranging from maritime assistance to special operations.
                        With respect to my role in the military, recently completed work that was key to a strategic relationship with China and that has implications on work with North Korea.  At Merck, am part of an amazing marketing team.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
 B.S., University, India; Ph.D., Drexel University College of Medicine
  We are all inquisitive, ambitious, and hard-working. The caliber of science that’s discussed just in the hallway or at a water cooler is incredible.  And, it's inspiring to know that our ideas can be supported by Merck’s resources and technology.
Gokul Swaminathan is a passionate scientist whose work is already driving important advances in the field of vaccines and infectious disease. 
“was born and raised in India, and the impact that infectious diseases have is very personal to me,” he says. “I’ve experienced malaria and dengue fever first-hand and have lost family and friends at young ages, which led to my fascination with pathogens and how they can manipulate the human body.”
At 19, while pursuing his undergraduate engineering degree at University, India, he was chosen to perform his thesis research work at the Georgetown University Medical Center as an international research scholar. From there, Gokul continued his training at Drexel University, where his research focused on understanding how interacts with human immune cells. His research at Drexel earned him the Amadeo Bondi award for research excellence, one of the school’s most prestigious awards given to a graduate student, and sparked his interest in the translational side of research – how to turn his findings into medicines and vaccines.
Armed with a Ph.from Drexel, Gokul joined in 2014 as a 
. After his rotation, he accepted a full-time position as a senior scientist in our infectious diseases and vaccines research group at our West Point laboratories.
In 2016, he was a founding employee at Merck’s newly established Exploratory Science Center in Cambridge, Massachusetts. There, he and some of his colleagues are initially focusing on understanding how the human body interacts with pathogens in order to help develop better and safer vaccines and therapies against infectious diseases.
When asked how he found the move, he jokingly notes that Cambridge is “a bit colder than I’m used to” while being “full of so many over-achievers, it’s almost annoying. But every conversation have here is scientifically and professionally enriching”.
Merck’s Exploratory Science Center
Cambridge, he notes, “is such an eclectic, international and very diverse place…You walk into a grocery store or coffee shop here, and everyone seems to have a significant list of achievements. With so many prestigious academic labs, research institutions, small biotechs and major pharmaceutical companies, Cambridge is one of the best places to be as a scientist.” This makes it a perfect spot for Merck’s Exploratory Science Center.  “The Exploratory Science Center is focused on early discovery research, exploring the most promising emerging science to help us understand the underlying biology of diseases. We are very focused on collaborating with local academics and biotechs, as well as across Merck’s research network.”
Gokul and his colleagues come from many different scientific backgrounds and “bring cultural perspectives from around the world,” he says.  “And we speak about a dozen languages between all of us.”
As Gokul notes, while these scientists and researchers all come from different places, they’re all working towards the same goal: fueling drug discovery research. “Our diverse backgrounds bring a fresh approach to how we identify and approach our research,” he says. “We are all inquisitive, ambitious, and hard-working. The caliber of science that’s discussed just in the hallway or at a water cooler is incredible.  And, it's inspiring to know that our ideas can be supported by Merck’s resources and technology.”
In 2018, Gokul represented Merck, the American BioPharmaceutical Companies/PhRMA, and the GoBoldly Campaign as a 2018 Spotlight Health Scholar at the Aspen Ideas Festival.  
"It was an amazing opportunity to interact with emerging leaders in global human health ranging from scientists, physicians, healthcare workers, policy makers and advocates from around the world," says Gokul.  "highlight was meeting Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams, and discussing the importance of vaccination and the need for continued surveillance and prevention of infectious diseases."
This year, Gokul will be the direct manager of a postdoc fellow. "I'm thrilled to be able to give back to this program, which paved the way for my many opportunities at this company, as a manager to a very talented scientist."
Traveling the United States of America
Between all of his studies and career advancement, you wouldn’t think Gokul has any spare time to do much of anything else. But he does. And his main interest outside of is traveling (although he never leaves his work too far behind).
“I’ve been to 48 states in this country - Hawaii and Alaska are pending - and my goal is to make it to all 50 very soon,” he says.
“As travel and meet new people, get to share my exciting journey as a scientist,” he says. “take great pride in saying am part of a company that makes a difference.”

Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common sexually transmitted infection in the For most people, clears up on its own. But for others who don’t clear the virus, certain types of can cause cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancers in females and anal cancer in both males and females. Other types can cause genital warts in both males and females.
HPV-Related Cancers and Diseases: Worldwide Problem
infections are the most common sexually transmitted infections in the About 14 million new genital infections occur each year.
For most people, clears on its own. But for others who don't clear the virus, certain types of can cause cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancers in females and anal cancer in both males and females. Other types can cause genital warts in both males and females.
An estimated 528,000 cervical cancer cases are diagnosed globally each year; more than 80 percent of the cases occur in developing countries.
In the U.S., there are an estimated 12,900 new cervical cancer cases each year.
These women are more than just numbers; each has her own story to share. Drawing on their experience to help elevate awareness of HPV-related cancers and diseases, these women courageously serve as voices of prevention.
Quita, like many other women, didn't know about and that some types of can cause cervical cancer. Fortunately, Quita was diagnosed early thanks to her diligence in getting screenings, and today she is healthy and enjoying life with her young son. She encourages everyone to talk with their doctors about ways to protect themselves.
When Michele Baldwin, a single mother in her forties, was diagnosed with cervical cancer, she knew she wanted to do something to help increase awareness of the disease. Michele partnered with the Global Initiative Against and Cervical Cancer (GIAHC) to complete a 700-mile paddle board expedition across the Ganges River in November 2011, with the goal of helping to increase knowledge about cervical cancer among women in India.
collaborates with organizations and local governments worldwide to help foster community access to education, prevention and detection methods.
 By helping to raise awareness of the connection between and cervical cancer, increasing access to cervical cancer screenings and other prevention programs, we aim to empower communities  worldwide to reduce the burden of certain HPV-related cancers.

Perceived stigma associated with infection can affect self-esteem and quality of life.
Stigmatization may cause people with the hepatitis virus (HCV) to avoid testing, treatment and care.
Chronic hepatitis is a serious liver disease caused by the hepatitis virus (HCV) that, over time, can cause liver damage and cirrhosis (scarring of the liver). One of the challenges of managing chronic hepatitis is that people with often have no symptoms —  and can live with an infection for decades without feeling sick. 
. Stigmatization has been identified by researchers as one of the most significant issues facing people who are hepatitis positive and is seen by many as a barrier to care. 
The stigma of a hepatitis diagnosis may stem from its association with injection drug use. However, before 1992, was also commonly spread through blood transfusions and organ transplants before widespread screening of the blood supply began in the  is also potentially infectious. Although not easily transmitted, people are nevertheless fearful and may shun those who have the disease; and, furthermore, some people don’t like to be around people who are "sick." Stigma impacts HCV-infected people regardless of how they actually contracted the virus, whether through contaminated blood products, the reuse of unsterilized equipment, an accidental needle prick, or the past use of injection drugs.
The Impact of Stigmatization
These norms, behaviors, and beliefs surrounding hepatitis infection can lead to alienation from family and friends, as well as to discrimination (perceived or real) in health services and workplaces.
Indeed, many chronic hepatitis patients report feelings of stigmatization and social isolation from their friends, family, and coworkers.
“We’ve talked to infected grandmothers whose own children won’t allow them to play with their grandchildren because they’re afraid of some sort of transmission,” reports Michael Ninburg, executive director of the Hepatitis Education Project, a Seattle-based group founded in 1993 to provide education, support, and advocacy for those living with hepatitis.
recently diagnosed patient who works with Michael’s group echoed this sentiment. “I'm super outgoing. talk about every feeling have to my friends, just about anybody, and my diagnosis was something could not talk about,” he said.  “knew that had to do something about it, but was ashamed.”
We've worked with patients who haven’t told their families about their hepatitis diagnosis.
This stigma may make patients fear disclosure and may lead to reduced social support and barriers to medical care. This, in turn, has the potential to hinder the growing chronic hepatitis epidemic.
We need a real public health effort to tackle this stigma,
We need governments and communities to step up and make people aware that they may be at risk.  If they are at risk, they need to address it.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
                          dangerous spider bite spurs our European Union supply chain team to go above and beyond to deliver an antidote. 
spider on Cyprus, an island in the Mediterranean Sea, bites a woman on the hand. Severe reaction sets in. She’s rushed to the hospital in the city of Nicosia. 
We received a call at our facility in Haarlem, Netherlands, from the hospital in Nicosia to see if we could provide a spider antitoxin.
Our team quickly determined that the fastest way to get the antitoxin to the patient was to fly it there. We carried a batch of it from our Haarlem warehouse to the airport, flew to Cyprus and delivered it to the hospital at 2:30 p.m. local time on Nov. 8. 
The time from the call to delivery to the patient?  23.5 hours.
That’s how our company and our people work together to rise to the occasion.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
                            William Campbell, Ph.D., shared the 2015 Prize for discoveries related to avermectin, which in turn led to a treatment for river blindness. Here's how Dr. Campbell, fellow researcher Dr. Mohammed Aziz and other colleagues helped change the world for the better.
When scientist William Campbell and Japanese microbiologist, Satoshi Omura, collaborated on a microbe screening program more than 30 years ago, they could not have predicted that their discoveries would one day help protect the eyesight of millions in Latin America, Africa and Yemen – nor that their efforts would garner them the world’s highest recognition of scientific achievement. But on October 5, 2015, the Nobel Assembly announced that Drs. Campbell and Omura were jointly awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery of avermectin, an antiparasitic agent from which ivermectin is derived. Ivermectin is known as outside the United States. third recipient, Youyou Tu of China, was recognized for her work leading to the discovery of the antimalarial agent artemisinin.
                            “Diseases caused by parasites have plagued humankind for millennia and constitute a major global health problem,” the Assembly 
. “This year’s Nobel Laureates have developed therapies that have revolutionized the treatment of some of the most devastating parasitic diseases.”
Through our Mectizan Donation Program, we have been working with partners for three decades to make this medicine available, free of charge, to all those affected by river blindness. We remain committed to bringing the best that our science and innovation have to offer to solve the world’s global health challenges.
                            In the 1970’s Dr. Campbell was a parasitologist at Research Laboratories in Rahway, N.J., where he led what he once recalled was a “complicated and unglamorous search” to find a new treatment for parasites in animals. His team finally found what it was looking for in soil sample No. OS3153 from Dr. Omura’s team in Japan. The discovery of avermectin was a major milestone in the treatment of parasitic disease.
Further research in the mid-to-late 1970s by Dr. Campbell and his colleagues at led to the development of ivermectin and the discovery that it was effective against river blindness in humans.
Onchocerciasis, more commonly known as “river blindness,” is a debilitating disease endemic to parts of Africa, Latin America and Yemen. It is transmitted through the bite of black flies and can cause intense itching, disfiguring dermatitis, eye lesions and, eventually, blindness.
                            Following the breakthrough lab work by Dr. Campbell, another researcher, the late Dr. Mohammed Aziz, championed the clinical development of ivermectin. Clinical trials in Africa sponsored by and the World Health Organization (WHO) and spearheaded by Dr. Aziz confirmed the effectiveness of ivermectin as a treatment for river blindness.
as much as needed for as long as needed
 – with the goal to help eliminate river blindness. recognized in order to reach this goal, many organizations with unique skills would need to work together as a team. As a result, created the Mectizan Donation Program (MDP). Operating from the Atlanta-based Task Force for Global Health, the coordinates activities between Merck, WHO, the World Bank and a range of public and private stakeholders.
                            In 1998, expanded its commitment from the Mectizan Donation Program to include donating ivermectin for another disease, lymphatic filariasis (LF), also known as elephantiasis, in African countries and Yemen where it co-exists with river blindness. For LF, ivermectin is administered with albendazole, a drug donated by GSK.
More than 25 years: The Mectizan Donation Program
                            Today, the Mectizan Donation Program is the longest-running disease-specific drug donation program and public-private partnership of its kind. It reaches more than 250 million people in the affected areas annually, with more than 2 billion treatments donated since 1987.
                            Both river blindness and lymphatic filariasis on are the WHO's list of neglected tropical diseases targeted for elimination globally. Several countries in Africa are making significant progress towards eliminating both diseases. In Latin America,three countries - Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico - have already received verification of river blindness elimination. And, Togo becomes the first country in Africa recognized by to have eliminated lymphatic filariasis (LF) as a public health problem.
The importance of ivermectin for improving the health and wellbeing of millions of individuals with river blindness and lymphatic filariasis, primarily in the poorest regions of the world, is immeasurable. Treatment is so successful that these diseases are on the verge of eradication, which would be a major feat in the medical history of humankind,

  We get to invent every single day, sometimes it’s little things, sometimes it's big things. But at the end of the day, you realize all of the little things that you're inventing work towards a common goal of having an impact on human health.
This is what makes Stephanie Barrett’s job so important. 
                          Stephanie leads a team at that works on inventing long-acting formulations of our medicines. “These long-acting formulations are developed to give patients new options to take their medicines,” she notes.
“am inspired by the potential for long-acting formulations to treat — and even help prevent — certain diseases,” she notes. “would feel an incredible amount of pride to contribute to a new option for patients.”
                            Stephanie has had many roles in our labs since she joined the company almost 10 years ago, but she’s especially drawn to her current team’s mission and how it works towards Merck’s goal of

                            “But think at the end of the day realize that all of these little things that we're inventing work towards a common goal of having an impact on saving and improving lives.”

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Our job is to be as diligent as we possibly can.
The fight against antimicrobial resistance is an everyday battle — like to think of it as a war on harmful bacteria. And our work — just like the bacteria we are aiming to combat — is always changing.
Antibiotics have been extensively used for the treatment of bacterial infections ever since their introduction in the 1940s. But experience has shown us that over time, bacteria develop mechanisms to evade these important medicines, rendering treatment ineffective. It’s an evolutionary process. Simply put, a single bacterium that is able to adapt to withstand antibiotic therapy is able to survive, proliferate, and perhaps even spread to others. Tragically, once bacteria are resistant to the antibiotics in the physicians tool kit, there are limited options to fight these potentially deadly infections. My job is leading MRL’s product development teams, dedicated groups of people committed to being one step ahead in the fight against disease causing bacteria.
Our teams include discovery, manufacturing, clinical operations (which conducts studies in multiple countries around the globe), clinicians who design and review studies for efficacy and safety data, statisticians, and others. It’s a very diverse group of folks working towards the same goal — identifying unmet medical needs and making sure our medicines get to the patients who need them. Everyone understands their role in advancing that overall goal. It comes together in a harmonized, conclusive way.
It’s important that we be innovative, diligent, and agile.  The work of the public health community as a whole requires global surveillance to understand how resistance emerges and spreads. The fight is a global one, not just a local one. Our job is to be diligent as we possibly can.

Merck’s  Julie Gerberding, M.D., was honored as the Healthcare Businesswomen's Association (HBA) 2018 Woman of the Year. Julie was recognized for her remarkable contributions to  health as a physician, infectious disease expert, first female director of the and for her leadership roles at Merck. Julie accepted the award at an event attended by more than 2,000 people from across the healthcare and the life sciences industries.
Condoleezza Rice, former Secretary of State, reflected in a video message on some of Julie’s achievements:
“I’ve worked side by side with Julie during some of the toughest times,” she said. “We dealt with global pandemics like the avian flu. We dealt with post-9/11 threats of biological warfare. We dealt with the anthrax attack and alarm over smallpox.”
Passionate Advocate for Women in the Workplace
Julie was also recognized for her steadfast advocacy for the development and advancement of women in the workplace.
“Julie is a tireless champion of women,” said Ken Frazier, chairman and CEO, at the event. “Everywhere she goes, she works to advance the cause of women’s leadership and gender parity.”
"At Merck, we have a belief that was first expressed by our modern-day founder, who said, 'We try never to forget that medicine is for the people.' We live by those words. But with every fiber of her being, Julie embodies them. And because she does, our company – and our world – are a better places."

It requires coordinated contributions across different disciplines, different sectors, and different cultures. It requires building a robust network of people who bring a diverse range of experiences and perspectives to the table to achieve the goals, and playing to their collective strengths.
Kunbi Rudnick, associate director, Global Marketing, was also recognized at the event as a

                            According to statistics from the American Heart Association, cardiovascular disease causes 17.3 million deaths each year across the globe – more than all forms of cancer combined.
                            In the U.S., nearly 801,000 people died from heart disease, stroke and other cardiovascular diseases in 2013. About 2,200 Americans die each day from these diseases, one every 40 seconds.
For example, over 159 million adults — or about 69 percent — are overweight or obese.
About 80 million adults — or about 33 percent — have high blood pressure, and among those who are treating their high blood pressure, only about half have their condition controlled.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
about her personal struggle with insomnia.
 (NSF), most adults should get around seven to nine hours of sleep per night. Many people are able to fall and stay asleep without any trouble, but for the 
 that have symptoms consistent with the diagnosis of insomnia, sleep is an ongoing issue.
Insomnia can be frustrating, but sufferers aren't alone. That's why has teamed up with Christina Applegate on 
, to share her personal insomnia story and help others learn more about what might be keeping them awake.
An insomnia sufferer for most of her adult life, Christina knows all too well how hard it can be to struggle with sleep.
"As an actress, wife and mother of an active 6-year-old, have to push through the day, even if I'm very tired and haven't slept well," said Applegate. "But sometimes it's hard to feel excited for the day when don't get enough sleep. It makes me worry about what my family thinks when I'm tired all the time."
Christina had talked to her doctor in the past, but only recently learned more about the science behind sleep.
Insomnia can be a challenging condition, but there are many sleep habits, also known as sleep hygiene, that may help to improve your sleep.
Not only can the light be disruptive to your sleep, but watching the clock can increase stress, and make it harder for you to fall asleep. Instead, turn the face away from you.
Get up and leave the bedroom
Lying awake in bed can adversely affect the association between your bedroom and sleep. Instead, try getting out of bed and doing a quiet activity, such as reading in another room. When you start to feel sleepy, you can try going back to bed. 
The blue light given off by electronic devices can block the production of melatonin, a hormone your brain produces to help you fall and stay asleep. Plan to power down your devices at least an hour before bed.
Studies have found long-term exercise can help adults with insomnia fall asleep faster and stay asleep a bit longer. Just be sure not to work out too close to bedtime, as this can have the opposite effect.
Why So Awake offers tools and resources to help insomnia sufferers learn more about what might be happening in their brains when trying to sleep. If you struggle with insomnia, like Christina, follow the link below and find out more about what might be keeping you awake.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
In 2003, Dr. Sanjeev Arora, a liver disease specialist and social entrepreneur at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, Albuquerque, created a program which links expert medical specialist teams at academic hubs with primary care clinicians in local communities.
Called Project (short for Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes), the initiative improves the way medical education is delivered to people in rural and underserved communities. Project is a telementoring model that links expert specialists with primary care providers through virtual clinics (teleclinics), where the specialists mentor and share their knowledge, enabling primary care providers to develop the ability to treat local patients with complex conditions.
The Foundation is pleased to announce it is helping this movement expand in India and Vietnam with a $7 million grant. Given the significant need to improve health care throughout India and Vietnam, this project, which will span over five years, has four central goals:
Further develop superhubs in India to provide training and technical assistance;
Develop and expand hubs (specialty teams at academic medical centers or other care centers) across India and Vietnam in targeted communities;
Work with hubs in India and Vietnam to develop and implement training programs for community health care workers to further expand access to treatment and care; and
Document the impact of the model on improving access to specialty care for patients in rural and underserved areas in India and Vietnam.
“At Merck, we value and support our partners who are experimenting with new health care models and technologies aimed at solving complex health problems,” said Dr. Julie Gerberding, chief patient officer, Merck, and chief executive officer, Foundation. “Project will help to make a meaningful impact on patients living with chronic conditions in India and Vietnam by empowering local providers with the specialized medical knowledge they need.”
As part of the initiative, a community health worker program will be developed to further expand access to appropriate care in rural communities. The community health workers will join the more than 3,000 doctors, nurses and community health workers currently enrolled in Project ECHO’s comprehensive disease management programs. To date, Project has operated more than 90 hubs for more than 45 diseases and conditions in 16 countries outside the United States.
“We are incredibly grateful for this generous donation from the Foundation,” says Dr. Arora. “Strengthening the skills and capabilities of primary care providers in rural or remote settings helps to ensure patients receive the right care at the right place and the right time.”

“remember feeling really tired, thirsty, achy, and just in a bad mood - just not myself.”
“Never in a million years would have ever thought was going to get a phone call saying you have breast cancer.”
“When first found out was positive, was scared. was shocked.”

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
                            While cancer cases continue to rise around the world, the fight is personal not only for patients and their loved ones but also for the scientific community.
Cancer is like a personal terrorist…it starts small and attempts a hostile takeover of your entire body. It consumes your person from the inside out, racing through your system and showing no mercy. It uses force and fear and violence to control you. It tries to claim your body, your life, your time and your dignity…
There is perhaps no better view into what a person fighting cancer faces than the words of someone who has lived with it…someone like Jamie Goldfarb. And there’s also no better inspiration for innovative biomedical research companies like to fight harder than ever on their behalf.
We have all been affected by cancer, whether through family, friends, neighbors, colleagues — or even personally. The chance to have a broad impact on Jamie and the millions of people like her is driving all of us in the scientific community. It’s more than work — it’s a passion, and it’s personal,
 said Frank Clyburn, executive vice president, chief commercial officer, Merck. 
Together, we hope to make it possible to help alter the prognoses of those suffering with cancer.
executive vice president, chief commercial officer, The Gravity of the Disease
The impact of cancer is astounding. Chances are you know someone — likely more than one person — who has been afflicted with the disease. Consider:
Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide. In 2012, there were 14.1 million new cases and 8.2 million cancer-related deaths worldwide.
In 2018, an estimated 1,735,350 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the United States and 609,640 people will die from the disease.
The number of new cancer cases per year is expected to rise to 23.6 million globally by 2030.
Something about the disease, which is random, through no fault of anyone, it strikes a person, it doesn't pick gender, ethnicity, it's indiscriminate…
– Eric Rubin, vice president, early-stage development,
Merck's Humans for Health
Explore the people behind the inventions and patients that inspire them every day.
As someone who has lived with cancer and understands the value of family, love and life, Jamie Goldfarb's message to the scientific community is:
It's important for medical researchers to keep going and keep pushing innovation forward.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
New Frontier in Head and Neck Cancer Treatment
Dr. Cheng has been treating head and neck cancer patients for many years.  This is his personal perspective. 
Interested in joining Jonathan in our mission
have treated patients with head and neck  cancers for many years, so have seen, up close, the difficult experience  of living with head and neck cancer. Cancer is a trying situation for all patients and their loved ones, but head and neck patients face cancer in a unique and difficult way, with their disease and tumors often visible to the public.
have been involved in research for years as part of scientists' decades-long endeavor to bring forward meaningful advances for patients diagnosed with this potentially aggressive disease. Until recently, such advances were hard to come by and my patients and  struggled with the limited treatment options available.
But while there is a significant need for new treatment options, the good news is that there have been some improvements in survival rates over the years and we are seeing a new and encouraging future ahead.
We have begun to leverage our understanding of biology to develop more  precise therapies. At Merck, we are focused on immuno-oncology research, which studies  the role of the immune system in detecting and fighting cancer. We are studying  the potential of this approach, which aims to harness and restore the body’s ability  to detect and fight cancer cells, in a number of cancers, including head and  neck cancer. Immuno-oncology has already significantly changed the way certain cancers  are treated, including melanoma and lung cancer, as well as in the treatment of head and  neck cancer.
Change is coming to the head and neck cancer  landscape – and it is thrilling to be a part of it. To be able to see how our  research and efforts at are having a direct impact on how physicians  approach the treatment of their patients and what patients may expect from  their treatment is what motivates us to work harder.

Bridging the Gap: Reducing Disparities in Diabetes Care
This new initiative will bring together the health care sector and other sectors to support innovative approaches to diabetes treatment and management.
An estimated 30 million people have diabetes in the U.S., and the numbers are increasing.   Vulnerable and underserved populations in our communities are the most affected, with a higher prevalence of both the disease and its related complications. Too often, these individuals do not receive the help they need to effectively manage their diabetes, including addressing other factors that influence their health such as access to healthy foods and safe options for physical activity.
To help improve the health of people living with diabetes, the Foundation is proud to work with the program partners of, 
Bridging the Gap: Reducing Disparities in Diabetes Care
, to increase access to high-quality diabetes care and reduce health disparities in vulnerable and underserved communities in the U.S.

 between the health care sector and other sectors to address the medical and social factors that influence health.
, including transforming primary care, to improve the delivery of diabetes care for vulnerable and underserved populations.
 for individuals with type 2 diabetes through measures such as better glucose and lipid control.
There is a higher prevalence of diabetes in underserved communities, where many patients do not receive the help they need to effectively manage their health. Through 
, we will work with our partners to promote sustainable improvements in diabetes care for those who need it the most.
– Dr. Julie Gerberding, chief patient officer, Merck, and chief executive officer, Foundation
, the Foundation will foster a comprehensive approach to improve diabetes care and outcomes for vulnerable and underserved populations in the  With $16 million in funding from the Foundation over five years, 
 will support multifaceted diabetes programs in selected communities around the country. Through a comprehensive cross-site evaluation, the Foundation will also assess the impact of this initiative, with a goal of promoting best practices in primary care transformation and advancing multi-sector collaborations to reduce diabetes disparities in the U.S.
The Foundation is a U.S.-based, private charitable foundation. Established in 1957 by Merck, a leading global biopharmaceutical company, the Foundation is funded entirely by the company and is Merck’s chief source of funding support to qualified non-profit charitable organizations. Since its inception, the Foundation has contributed more than $870 million to support important initiatives that address societal needs and are consistent with Merck’s overall mission of inventing for life by bringing forward medicines and vaccines for many of the world’s most challenging diseases.

							diagnosis of hepatitis C, caused by the hepatitis virus (HCV), doesn’t mean you have to face it alone.
							As the executive director of the patient advocacy organization, the Hepatitis Education Project (HEP), as well as a former chronic hepatitis patient, Michael Ninburg knows first-hand what a diagnosis of can mean for patients.
When a person is diagnosed with hepatitis C, the support of a community can help them get through the experience.
Our role is to meet with clients who have been diagnosed with chronic hepatitis and help them in every step of the process.
According to Nickel...
We help them find a primary care physician; we let them know about tests their health care provider may request, for example, to find out their genotype.
We help ensure they get a referral to a liver specialist. We help them get to their appointments if they need that kind of help.
We talk to them about the different kinds of results that they may have received and help them develop questions to ask their health care provider about the different kinds of treatments.
							Ninburg refers to patient advocacy groups as “navigators, support systems and allies” in the patient fight against chronic hepatitis “It’s really important to us to be by their side in order for them to obtain fair access to medical treatment,” he says. Kyon, a HCV-positive patient who is currently working with to gain access to treatment, agrees. “I'm grateful for having advocacy organizations because there are a lot of roadblocks to go through with a diagnosis. If you don’t have anybody there with you, it can be very daunting and very challenging. You can feel very alone.”

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
The Exploratory Science Center (MESC) is focused on exploring the causes of some of the most challenging diseases.
Research Laboratories (MRL), the arm of our company focused on discovering and developing therapies to improve patients’ lives, has had a rich and successful legacy developing medicines and vaccines for some of the world’s most challenging diseases.
The ever-changing landscape of drug discovery means we need to constantly be in-tune with new approaches, which is why expanding our discovery capabilities in 
 and Cambridge, two important centers of biomedical innovation, is vital to our mission of 
Scientific disciplines are evolving rapidly. They are creating a convergence of emerging science and technologies that we believe will continue to open new horizons…We are positioning ourselves to take advantage of our core strength – drug invention – and to match that with how the world is evolving in the earliest discovery space in different geographic areas.
We’re inventing for life.  We continue to invest in discovery because the world needs cures.  Watch the video to learn how we’re cultivating invention.
Located in Cambridge’s Kendall Square neighborhood, in the heart of the Boston/Cambridge 
, the is near some of the world’s leading academic institutions, research hospitals, many other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and Merck's Boston discovery research site, which opened in 2004.
The is made up of approximately 40 accomplished researchers with diverse scientific backgrounds but one common goal: To bring together biology, chemistry, technology and drug discovery under one roof to ultimately help MRL’s global network of researchers to discover and develop new and innovative medicines and vaccines.
Scientists here are using their curiosity and creativity to help us better understand how diseases operate.  This helps identify new potential targets for our drug and vaccine discovery research. Their research activities include identifying:
How infectious organisms (pathogens) interact with host cells
Microbiome (collection of micro-organisms residing in and on the body) response
The Exploratory Science Center is led by Daria Hazuda. Daria is a world-renowned biochemist and expert in drug discovery whose research in infectious disease biology has led to the discovery and development of multiple novel medicines to treat and chronic Hepatitis C.
Learn more about Daria’s work and career at .
There’s a reason for the ‘and’ in Research and Development…You need to have both. You need to have people exploring new areas of biology to uncover new opportunities – which is what we hope to do in Cambridge — and you need to have those scientists who can recognize what a good molecule looks like in order to successfully deliver a medicine to the market, which is what our global network can do.
— Daria Hazuda, vice president of infectious diseases and vaccines discovery at and the head of MESC.

Research Laboratories South San Francisco is breaking ground on a new, cutting-edge research facility, scheduled to be operational in 2019. The new discovery research facility will accommodate more than 300 scientists and support research spanning exploratory biology through early clinical development.

day to raise awareness of and HPV-related cancers and diseases.
March 4, 2018 is the first-ever annual International Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Awareness Day.
is excited to rally around this new annual milestone, which shines a spotlight on and helps raise much needed awareness.
Human Papillomavirus, or HPV, is a common virus that can have potentially serious consequences. How common, you ask? So common, that will infect most sexually-active people in their lifetime! 
For most people, clears on its own.
  But, for others who don't clear the virus, it can cause certain cancers and diseases later in life. And there’s no way to predict who will or won’t clear the virus.
And doesn’t discriminate. In fact, both men and women are at risk for the cancers and diseases it can cause. In women, can cause cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancer. It can also cause anal cancer and genital warts in both women and men.
The estimated number of people in the infected with 
The estimated number of people in the diagnosed with an HPV-related cancer 
The estimated number of people in the diagnosed with an HPV-related cancer 
The number of treatment options for infection. While there may be treatments available for certain HPV-related cancers and diseases, there is no treatment available for infection.
 You have to talk about it, and talking about my story and sharing my story is my way of advocating.
After having survived cervical cancer three times Laura hopes that her story will help raise awareness about HPV-related cancers.
Talk to your doctor to get educated about
 take action by raising awareness about HPV.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
“Cancer research” can bring to mind labs, medicines, and graphs showing how well one treatment compares to another. But how often do we think of the people behind those graphs?  
The patients who participate in clinical trials are the true heroes of cancer research. They show extraordinary courage – and make tremendous sacrifices – while giving valuable insights into critical research. 
To express our appreciation, began #DearCancerHeroes – a social media campaign to recognize their fortitude and contributions to the field. It’s a small gesture to show our gratitude. We want to let clinical trial participants know they are not alone and there is a whole community of people cheering them on. 
Cancer research has come a long way and still has a long way to go. However, we wouldn’t have gotten to where we are today without these heroes.

“Never in a million years would have ever thought was going to get a phone call as pulled into my garage at 5 p.m saying ‘you have breast cancer’,” she remembers. “sat in the garage, it was devastating. called my mom, told my daughter ... think my phone call to my daughter was the hardest.”
For a patient with breast cancer, as well as any patient with cancer, there are different steps in the process. The first is the surprise and realization that there is a disease that needs to be addressed. There can be fear about the future. And eventually, there is an adjustment and the realization that one has to do what needs to be done so that you can move forward with your life

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Being an ethical company is about much more than simply adhering to the letter of the law.  But it’s an important step.
As part of our long-standing commitment to ethics and good corporate citizenship, our first step is always to comply with the laws and regulations that govern the way we market and sell our medicines, vaccines and other products.
is consistent with recommendations set forth by the Department of Health and Human Services and the 
 Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals created by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA)
seeks to prevent, detect and resolve potential violations of law or company policy; and 
undergoes regular assessment and adjustment to make sure we are being responsive to our evolving business and associated compliance risks. 
Merck’s Board of Directors and senior management, including the company’s Chief Compliance Officer and Corporate Compliance Committee, oversee the company’s global compliance program, including compliance-related policies and procedures, education and training – all of which reflect the highest standards and are tailored to Merck’s business and culture.
require employees to report potential violations of law or company policy;
hold ourselves accountable for responding promptly when potential violations arise;
take disciplinary action as appropriate; and
examine whether identified violations are in part due to gaps in our policies, practices or internal controls and, if so, take appropriate action to prevent future violations.
Our compliance program is just one part of our overall commitment to operating ethically, openly and transparently. But we believe it’s the right place to start.

Changing the Statistics: Commitment to Diabetes Research
With the prevalence of diabetes continuing to grow in many countries, it is one of the most serious chronic health challenges we face today.  Approximately 425 million adults worldwide have diabetes. Because diabetes may increase the risk of many complications – including kidney disease, retinal damage, peripheral nerve disease, heart attack and stroke – its impact can be significant. Diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the U.S., and sixth worldwide.
Advancements in diabetes research are making a remarkable difference,  but we recognize there is much more work to be done. In fact, about one-third of  adults with diabetes in the are not at their A1goal.  
At Merck, we are deeply committed to changing this statistic – for more  than 15 years, we’ve demonstrated our commitment to diabetes research.  We strive for scientific excellence  and innovation in all stages of research, from evaluating early pipeline  candidates to conducting rigorous late-stage studies.  Importantly, we recognize the tremendous  added value of collaborating with others to achieve our collective goals for  people with diabetes.  To that end, we  have established collaborations with a number of academic institutions, as well  as biotechnology and other pharmaceutical companies.
Additionally, we understand  that to advance diabetes management, it is necessary to generate an extensive  collection of data. 
The  fight against diabetes is not an easy undertaking, but am confident that  important progress is being made. am proud to be part of a research team that is committed to doing something truly meaningful to help people with diabetes.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
                         Alfred Alberts, a former biochemist who made significant contributions to the field of cardiovascular  medicine, died in Fort Collins, Colo. He was 87.
Alberts was a key figure  in the “cholesterol revolution” that started in the late 20th  century. High levels of cholesterol are associated with a greater risk  of heart attacks and strokes.
Born in New York City in  1931, Alberts graduated from Erasmus Hall High School and Brooklyn College,  where he earned a bachelor’s degree in zoology. In 1953, he married his high  school sweetheart, Helene (“Sandy”) Cuba, before serving two years in the Army,  where his duties included work in the Army labs. 
After receiving an  honorable discharge from the Army, Alberts returned to school on the Bill to  study cell biology. He began his graduate work at the University of Kansas  before transferring to the University of Maryland, where he became an “A.B.D.”  – meaning he completed “all but the dissertation.” The University of Maryland  later awarded Alberts an honorary degree.
When his Bill  benefits ran out in 1959, Alberts left school to support his family. He started  his career as a lab technician at the National Institutes of Health, working  under Dr. Roy Vagelos, who was serving as a research physician at the time  and who ultimately became the chairman and of Merck.
In 1966, Alberts joined  Vagelos at Washington University in St. Louis to do research in the Biochemistry  Department. During his time there, Alberts distinguished himself both in the  lab and as an advisor to many students and post-doctoral fellows in the  department – so much so, in fact, that he was promoted to associate professor with  tenure despite not having completed his Ph.D.
Alberts spent a decade at  Washington University before joining in 1975 as Director, Department of  Biochemical Regulation. Alberts led pioneering research conceived by Vagelos to  apply new biochemical approaches to drug discovery.
“That was the beginning of the cholesterol revolution, and none of it would have been possible without Al,” said  Vagelos. “He was just terrific at science and research, and he never wavered.” 
Colleagues remember watching  Alberts, during the brief breaks in his experiments, dashing to the  library to catch up on the latest scientific literature, even finding  translations of foreign journals.
“Al’s steadfast pursuit of  science has permanently changed the course of coronary heart disease and  improved the health of many people,” said Ken Frazier, Merck’s current chairman  and 
Drs. Michael Brown and Joseph Goldstein, who  received the 1985 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their research on cholesterol regulation, credit Alberts for his impact. 
“We did the basic science but as physicians, we  were very anxious to see that our work would one day benefit patients,” Brown  said.
mentor to a number of aspiring  scientists over the years, Alberts was known at for his humility and  kindness. Despite his extraordinary achievements, former colleagues say that he  was always more interested in helping others than promoting himself. 
Even though “Al ate and slept  science,” according to his wife Sandy, their 64 years together were filled with  joy. In addition to his wife, Alberts is survived by his three children,  Heather Alberts (Robert Gottlieb), Mitch Alberts, and Eli Alberts (Julie Wang),  and two grandchildren, Nellie Gottlieb and Jacob Gottlieb.

Globally, an estimated 71 million people are living with chronic hepatitis infection. Most don't know it.
Chronic hepatitis is a serious liver disease caused by the hepatitis virus (HCV) that over time, can cause liver damage and cirrhosis (scarring of the liver).
One of the challenges of managing hepatitis is that people with often have no symptoms -- and can live with an infection for decades without feeling sick.
Hepatitis is a contagious liver disease that ranges in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness that attacks the liver.  It results from infection with HCV, which is spread primarily through contact with the blood of an infected person.  Hepatitis can be either "acute" or "chronic."

Before 1992, when widespread screening of the blood supply began in the U.S., hepatitis was also commonly spread through blood transfusions and organ transplants.  Today, most people in the become infected with by sharing needles or other equipment to inject drugs. The presence of can be detected with a blood test from a healthcare provider. The recommends any person with a potential risk factor, including anyone born between 1945 - 1965, get tested for chronic HCV.
Decades can pass between the time of acquiring infection and the development of HCV-related liver disease such as cirrhosis.

The prevalence of cirrhosis in people living with chronic infection is expected to increase over the next 10 years.
This growing burden of on individuals, communities and healthcare systems has pushed the global scientific community to find ways to fight chronic infection.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
The Unique Role of Public Policy in Addressing Antimicrobial Resistance
Collectively, antimicrobial resistance is forcing policy makers to rethink the way diseases are managed, from how we diagnose and track infections to how we develop and use anti-infectives.
Nicole Mahoney, director, Global Regulatory Policy, As a researcher, used microscopes to better understand how cells work. Over the years, I’ve elevated and widened my focus, working with policy makers who want to apply science and technology to solve major health challenges.
Antibiotic resistance is one of them. Today, some patients have bacterial infections that doctors have great difficulty treating because of resistance and public health experts warn that the problem will only grow if we don’t work to address it now.
To start, we need to ensure that antibiotics are used appropriately so that they do not become obsolete due to resistance. Ideally, scientists will develop entirely new ways to treat and prevent infections. Both approaches will require new policies to encourage, reward and sustain innovation over time.  But like most complex problems, there’s no simple fix and science will only be part of the solution. Collectively, antimicrobial resistance is forcing policy makers to rethink the way diseases are managed, from how we diagnose and track infections to how we develop and use anti-infectives.
The good news is that policy makers around the world recognize the potential threat of unchecked antimicrobial resistance and key stakeholders—including governments, health care providers, public health groups and industry—have pledged action. 
I’m proud to work for a company that is part of the discussion, and the solution.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Despite new discoveries and improvements in the care of people with cancer, there's still a significant need for scientific advancement in this area. At Merck, we have made it our mission to help address this need through innovative research.
The need for further study is particularly true of bladder cancer, the ninth most common cancer in the world. Bladder cancers are divided into various types depending on the type of cells that become cancerous.  The most common type is urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma, which most often starts in the urothelial cells lining the inside of the bladder.
If not caught early enough, bladder cancer can become invasive and spread to other organs, making it a particularly complex condition to treat.  And, while these patients have more treatment options than ever before, they are still limited.
Our bladder cancer team has dedicated itself to researching the unmet needs of patients. In the case of our bladder cancer clinical development program, the concept of “it takes a village” has never been more evident. Working across functions – and continents – the team has worked tirelessly and collaboratively to uncover solutions and help patients with advanced urothelial bladder cancer. 
We invited members of the team to share perspective on what drives them
 to deliver on Merck’s mission.
With few options, people with an advanced bladder cancer diagnosis often face difficult treatment decisions. We are driven to do everything we can to help patients.
is more than a pharmaceutical company – it’s a group of dedicated experts working collaboratively toward delivering on our important mission of helping save lives.
It’s not only about collaboration, it’s about passion and commitment. Everyone on this team is personally committed to helping those living with bladder cancer. Because of this, collaboration just happens naturally.
Every single person on the advanced urothelial bladder cancer team has something important to add. We have to be flexible, shift priorities, and adapt to new situations, but even under this stress, each person knows their contribution is important because the patient is always top-of-mind.
Director, Global Project and Alliance Management
It’s about the patients. Many members of our team keep a picture at their desk of someone they know who has been personally impacted by cancer– it’s a stark reminder that our work can make a tremendous difference to the lives of patients and their loved ones.
We all invest many hours in our work on bladder cancer. It doesn’t matter where you are within the company, we believe in what we do and that’s why we’re here.
love working as a member of our collaborative oncology teams. go home at the end of the day knowing that we are working towards an end goal that may have a tangible impact on someone’s life.
The work we do is defined by collaboration. We can’t work in silos and all of my work relies on my colleagues in other functions. It’s part of the reason love my job so much –  each of us is a gear among other gears working as a team toward a common goal of helping patients.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Along with international agencies and governments, has played — and continues to play — a leadership role in responding to Ebola.
The 2014–2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976. There were more cases and deaths in this outbreak than all others combined. It also spread between countries, starting in Guinea then moving across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia. Unfortunately, a new outbreak was declared in May 2018 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 
Scientists from Merck, along with many external collaborators, remain at the forefront of the efforts to address this infectious disease. has also provided cash donations to a number of organizations involved in Ebola relief and recovery efforts:
                        Funding helped support the transport of medical supplies to the region. Donated products were also included in these shipments.
                        Funding supported UNICEF’s efforts focusing on controlling the outbreak, reinforcing and ensuring access to essential social services and scaling up prevention and preparedness activities.
                        Funds went towards conducting an assessment in Sierra Leone to determine specific strategies to stop the spread of the Ebola virus and prevent future outbreaks. also sent two infectious disease experts who specialize in infection control to join a team of other specialists to advise and conduct a rapid assessment of the response and relief efforts on the ground.
 partner International shipped donated products in their Medical Mission Packs to partners in Liberia and Sierra Leone to help support the health systems in both countries during the 2014 - 2016 outbreak.
Our community involvement programs focus on solving critical health and social issues.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Merck’s recently enhanced family-leave benefits provide six weeks of job-protected paid time off to spend with a new child, in addition to the company’s benefit of 20 weeks of unpaid child care leave and short-term disability.
These benefit improvements apply to all employees no matter how one chooses to expand their family: parents through birth, surrogacy, adoption, and foster placement. Financial assistance for adoption has more than doubled, and has been
                        expanded to include surrogacy. This new paid time off enhancement can be taken in consecutive weeks, as phased time off (individual days off per week for a number of weeks) or a combination of both.
has a long history of supporting our employees and their families. These support systems include benefits spanning from extensive health insurance, personal health coaching, a registered nurse hotline, flexible work arrangements and back-up child care, to financial planning, education assistance, employee discount programs and paid time off for volunteer
                            efforts. The list is far-reaching, but we never stop looking for ways to improve these benefits.
“Building an inclusive environment where talented people can build a career includes offering enhanced ways for all types of new parents to enjoy time off with financial backing.”
—Jeff Geller, vice president, Global Compensation and Benefits, Global Human Resources, Merck.
It is our hope that this new initiative strengthens our commitment in giving our employees access to a wide variety of health services, programs, resources and tools to support their family, health and well-being. It is fundamental to the success of
                    our business to ensure that employees take care of themselves and their families, as well as to fulfill social and civic responsibilities
Because we know that when our employees feel their best, in all aspects of their lives, they can perform at their best.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Few innovations have helped as many as the advent of the modern clinical trial, especially in cancer research. Without these important studies, doctors, regulators, patients and caregivers would not be able to determine what kinds of medicines may help patients, or the potential risks.
Interested in joining Eric in our mission
While the idea that we can carefully evaluate new medicines is taken for granted today, the clinical trial as it is understood today dates back only to the 1940s. Prior to that time, hucksters could – and did – push useless or harmless “cures” on anyone. It's no coincidence that the great leaps forward in medicine, such as antibiotics, are closely linked with the adoption of clinical trials as the gold standard for understanding a medicine’s effects.
The basic foundations of the randomized, blinded clinical trial – comparing different groups of otherwise-similar patients and ensuring that neither doctor nor patient is aware of who receives what treatment – have proven their value. But our recent work at is focused on ensuring that the clinical trials system advances and works more effectively. Quicker, smarter ways of conducting clinical trials means that we can answer scientific questions more quickly and more confidently, allowing more patients access to medicines that may potentially help them.
In some cases, we have worked closely with regulators to modify ongoing trials to enroll more patients and gather more data. New rules around “breakthrough” products have allowed more collaboration with the FDA, and this kind of collaboration has helped and others in the pharmaceutical industry to quickly gather the data needed to demonstrate the potential benefit of new treatment options.
Our immuno-oncology research program has been one area where we’ve been able to use these new tools. We have had the opportunity–when the early trials show promise–to expand studies to gather additional high-quality data, helping advance the potential for bringing medicines to cancer patients.
The design of Merck's oncology trials, too, is becoming more innovative. We have made important strides in developing new trial designs that allow us to evaluate multiple types of cancers in one study. This, in turn, makes it more likely that we can identify potential new medicines in a more efficient manner. The years to come are likely to see more such trials helping us to better answer questions on the best way to treat cancer.
But clinical trials can only advance cancer research if patients volunteer to participate. is committed to helping educate patients, doctors and caregivers about oncology clinical trials. For more on our approach on clinical trials and ongoing clinical trials, please visit

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
In 1982, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first used the term “AIDS,” or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, to describe the clinical syndrome caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
In the mid-1980s, began its clinical research in response to what the company perceived as a potential epidemic – our scientists were among the first to discover and develop medicines for the treatment of HIV.
Today, a future where HIV/can be a manageable illness is closer, in part, because of Merck’s response to the crisis.
Since the first products became available nearly two decades ago, has worked to expand access to our medicines, build healthcare infrastructure, and address health and development challenges around the world. maintains longstanding efforts to deliver its medicines to those who need it most, including differential pricing, voluntary licensing, public-private partnerships, philanthropic programs, and continued research and development efforts in HIV.
for Underserved Populations in the U.S.: initiative launched to connect more people living with to the care they need to stay healthy
(ACHAP): program established in 2000 with the Bill Melinda Gates Foundation to support Botswana, a country disproportionately affected by HIV/AIDS
Drawing from our passion for improving health,
continues to embrace today’s challenges in treatment.

In the U.S.
leading cause of death in the U.S.
More than 30 million Americans – 9.4% of the population – have diabetes. 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention projected that as many as one in three adults could have diabetes by 2050 if current trends continue.
People with type 2 diabetes should set individual goals to manage the ABCs of diabetes: is for A1C, is for blood pressure and is for cholesterol
Find out why it's important to know your ABCs by visiting 
Know the Tests: Self-Monitoring Blood Sugar and A1C
People with type 2 diabetes need both blood sugar self-tests and A1tests to help them and their doctors understand their blood sugar control because these tests measure blood sugar in different ways. Self-tests show a person with type 2 diabetes his or her blood sugar level at the time of the test. The A1test shows average blood sugar levels over the past 2-3 months. Both tests will help people with type 2 diabetes and their doctors set goals that are right for them. Learn more at

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
An epidemic of diphtheria is almost inevitable here. 
 am in urgent need of one million units of diphtheria antitoxin. 
                            This was the desperate radio telegram in January 1925 from Dr. Curtis Welch in Nome, Alaska, to all the major Alaska towns, to territorial Governor Scott Bone in Juneau, and to the Public Health Service in Washington, Diphtheria was spreading through the icebound community. Children had already died, and the local supply of diphtheria antitoxin had expired the previous summer.
                            Weather prevented a delivery by air, so relay teams of sled dogs and their mushers raced against the clock to deliver 300,000 units of antitoxin, which was produced by legacy company Mulford. They completed the 674-mile journey over what later became known as the Iditarod Trail in a record-breaking five days and seven hours despite whiteout conditions and temperatures of fifty degrees below zero.
This "Great Race of Mercy" is an iconic story of human compassion.
                            In 1895, the Mulford Company began marketing the first commercially available diphtheria antitoxin produced in the U.S., the very medication that helped avert the diphtheria epidemic in Nome. Today, has a significant presence in vaccine discovery, development and distribution in both human and animal health.
                                Merck's Dr. Maurice Hilleman belongs to a distinguished group of vaccine pioneers -- including Edward Jenner, Louis Pasteur, Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin. Dr. Hilleman is credited with helping to develop more than forty vaccines and his impact on public health is undeniable.
                            The considers immunizations one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century. In the U.S., vaccines are now available for a number of infectious diseases that once routinely affected individuals in all age groups. Many people think vaccines are for children, but adults also are susceptible to many infectious diseases. Each year in the U.S., thousands of adults suffer complications from diseases for which there are vaccines. In developing areas of the world, the toll is most often higher.
                            Outside the U.S., is working with national health ministries and non-government agencies to help write new chapters in the public health success story through partnerships, demonstration projects, donation programs, and technology transfer agreements.
Vaccines are a powerful force of health and health development, and their globalization is not just a business necessity but a public health obligation. is on a mission to ensure that more people can access our vaccines, regardless of where they live or their financial circumstances.

If you would prefer this article to be clearly written and cleanly designed, you would be a fan of 
For the uninitiated, health literacy is the degree to which individuals have the capacity to obtain, process, and understand basic health information and services needed to make appropriate health decisions.  Using the tenants of health literacy, is working to help make sure that the information our company puts out into the world is very clear.
Merck’s commitment to improving health literacy
Laurie Myers is the director of Global Health Literacy at Merck.
Laurie tells this story to illustrate her point: “My daughter had surgery to remove a birth mark on her leg.  They told me to limit her activity. ‘Limit activity’ is very simple language. My kids play a lot of sports. So to me, ‘limit activity,’ meant, ‘don’t go to soccer practice.’  It didn’t mean ‘sit on the sofa and put your leg up.’ So, poor thing, walked her around a children’s museum the next day and her leg started to bleed.  She needed another surgery.”
Laurie notes that it wasn’t the fault of the doctor or the hospital – there was just a disconnect between the recipient and the communicator.
Laurie’s first foray into health literacy was creating a new standard for developing patient labels for new molecules. This involved a partnership with health literacy leaders at Northwestern and Emory, patient feedback during label development, and getting the on board.  This year, launched our first two health literate patient labels.
 is the information that is developed by a pharmaceutical company and is approved by the for a particular medicine; it’s the document that is the basis for what we say to patients about that specific medicine moving forward in all of our communications. (One place people see this is in magazine ads for a product. When you turn the page and see all of the information at the back? That all comes from the patient label.) 
Next up for Laurie and her team are incorporating health literacy principles into other areas of the business, including packaging and clinical trials, as noted below in bullet points (a helpful design principle in health literacy):
Great strides have already been made in patient education, as shown below:
It’s important that we develop packaging that helps patients better understand how to take their medicines.
Health literacy is important for people to understand clinical trials.  Matching content to the audience and modifying language to improve comprehension can improve trust.
Laurie notes that we are leading the industry in terms of health literacy but there are still great strides we —  and the pharmaceutical industry — need to do to help a person’s ability to better understand, act on, and use health information.
want us to lead the conversation and help show the way for others to do the same,” she says. “Clear communication must be part of the care…and the cure.

What Cancers Have in Common: Pushing the Boundaries of Science
Dr. Mary Savage, like many scientists, translates her passion for biology into therapeutic approaches that make a difference in patients’ lives. This is her personal perspective.
Interested in joining Mary in our mission
Historically, oncology practice and clinical trial design primarily focused on where the tumor first emerged, such as colon or rectum, lung, breast, and endometrium. This approach follows the logic of the scalpel: pinpointing the location of the tumor first enabled surgical plans.
More recently, there have been significant advances in our understanding of the role of cancer biomarkers in molecular and cellular mechanisms that can drive tumor growth. 
Biomarkers are biological molecules (typically comprised of DNA, or protein) found in tissues or blood that can serve as a sign to better understand a condition or disease. Sometimes, the same biomarker is found across many different types of cancer, regardless of where the tumor first developed.  Within a specific tumor location, these biomarkers can sometimes differentiate whether the tumor is likely to respond to a given treatment.
As such, these biomarkers have been used to help inform clinical research, accelerating the process of getting targeted medicines to patients where separate trials would take years to conduct. Importantly, in some cases, these features can be assessed using laboratory tests that have long been available.  Where a test is either not available, or for research use only, the test manufacturer partners with the drug manufacturer to advance together into regulatory approval by government agencies (such as the FDA) a companion diagnostic assay to ensure safe and effective use of the drug in patients likely to respond.
The goal is to use a deeper understanding of the tumor biology and associated biomarkers to tackle tumor research more precisely; going beyond simply where a tumor arose. Instead, we are learning how to attack a cancer based on its biology at the cellular level. At Merck, efforts are underway to better understand microsatellite instability (MSI) and mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR). These biomarkers are present across tumor types, regardless of the original location of the cancer. The presence of high levels of (MSI-H) or dsignifies an underlying problem in a cell's ability to fix errors that occur when replicates. Tumor cells determined to have MSI-or dharbor hundreds to thousands of mutations.
The ultimate proof of our efforts will manifest as a new generation of cancer medicines: those that follow the logic of biology, not the logic of the scalpel.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Ten years ago, three organizations – the American Diabetes Association, Healthy Interactions and – set out to test a simple proposition around diabetes care: could a set of tools focused on lifestyle and behavioral changes help health care providers to improve diabetes management for patients? In the first 14 months, 10,000 diabetes educators were trained. Another 10,000 were trained in the first three years. Now, more than 30,000 educators across the country have been trained on the innovative “Diabetes 
Diabetes management is an unmet need, with most Americans with diabetes not meeting their glucose, lipid, and blood pressure goals. key missing element to achieving greater success in diabetes control is that only a fraction of people with diabetes get the recommended diabetes self-management tools they need. We know that managing this disease calls for a set of solutions in which education is at the center. As part of the 10-year diabetes education initiative called Journey for Control, we've seen that the Diabetes 
 program has been successful in bringing a dynamic option for diabetes education throughout the United States. The Map has become a widely-used teaching tool in diabetes education, providing a forum to promote free-flowing dialogue between diabetes educators and groups of people with diabetes.
The impact we have seen from the program shows that engaging and empowering people  never goes out of style. If anything, that kind of approach to patient education is increasingly critical to the success of our health care system.
In just 10 years, the Journey for Control program has provided training for more than 30,000 diabetes educators to use the Diabetes 
According to a survey of more than 20,000 people with diabetes, 95 percent of patients surveyed indicated that they would make life changes based on what they learned – and 90 percent said they would attend another session.
Along the way, we’ve been able to work together to enhance the program and make it even more effective, including providing more advanced training, the addition of goal setting and planning tools, and the development and roll-out of Spanish language resources. We are also advancing digital solutions, including mobile responsive design and soon-to-be introduced cloud and web-based tools.
Diabetes is a health issue that is too big, too complicated for any one organization to tackle alone, and we believe that our collaboration with the American Diabetes Association and Healthy Interactions has allowed the Diabetes 
 program to thrive. The success we’ve seen with this program is also compelling evidence that commitment matters. The Diabetes 
 program was designed to stand the test of time, and – a decade in – we’re gratified to see it continue to thrive and grow.
The fundamental lesson of the success of the Journey for Control program is that people matter. The Journey for Control program has always put the educator-patient relationship at the center of the process, using the Diabetes 
 program to guide that discussion in a way that equips patients to manage their disease, rather than assuming that a one-way broadcast of information will suffice. decade in, the data overwhelmingly back this approach, which is a model for future programs. Still, a 10-year anniversary is no reason to slow down: the program is continuing to find new providers to work with to expand the number of patients that can benefit from this kind of empowerment.

How Will You Invent the Future?
My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Throughout our more than 125-year history, women have helped advance Merck's mission to improve human and animal health while advancing scientific research.
Here, we celebrate the women whose hard work and tenacity have helped us continue to invent for life.
Every day, we're learning new things about cancer.
passion for helping people has long shaped Jennifer O'Neil's career choices. After graduate school at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, she completed post-doctoral research at the Dana Farber Cancer Research Institute in Boston. She later worked for a small biotech firm before coming to nine years ago. Today, she and her teams are focused on discovering and developing new ways to treat cancer.
"got into cancer research to hopefully have an impact on human health," Jennifer says. "Being at a place where we're really making progress in treating cancer patients hopefully can make that dream a reality in the near future. I'm pretty inspired."
As principal scientist, Jennifer is involved in all stages of oncology drug discovery at Merck.
"It's an exciting time to be in cancer research," says Jennifer. "Every day, we're learning new things about cancer and what it is about cancer cells that drive them, and as a result, we are making advances. There's more we need to do, but we're making progress, and that's really exciting."
We discover new compounds to help fight all sorts of things that can hurt animals, like ticks and worms.
Principal Scientist, Biology-Discovery, Antiparasitics
...we are committed to doing our part to improve the health and quality of life for animals.
German scientists Heike Williams and Anja Heckeroth, along with their colleagues at the Animal Health research facility in Schwabenheim, Germany, discover and test new antiparasitic compounds that fight ectoparasites, which live on the outer surface of the host (for example, fleas), and endoparasites, which live inside the host's body (worms and their ilk).
"We discover new compounds to help fight all sorts of things that can hurt animals, like ticks and worms," says Anja. "There are a variety of parasites you do not want to have on your dogs, cats, livestock or horses. They can create serious health problems for animals and humans."
The war against microscopic enemies is not an easy one to win. "Parasites have developed resistance," says Anja. "This is why our Animal Health scientists are always looking for new modes of action and new molecules from different compound classes that can cope with developed resistance in the field."
"Research in this area is a difficult task," adds Heike. "But we are committed to doing our part to improve the health and quality of life for animals through the research and development of safe, convenient and efficacious products."
Hedy Teppler, M.D.
wanted to be more involved in drug design and clinical trials, and was doing some groundbreaking work in HIV.
Retired-Section Head, Hepatology and HIV, Global Clinical Development- Infectious Diseases
We were faced with an opportunity to help patients infected with HIV.
In the early 1990s, Hedy Teppler was treating patients with HIV/at a hospital in Philadelphia. She was also serving as a clinical trial investigator for Phase 1 and 2 studies of a new class of anti-drugs designed to block the protease enzyme and thus prevent replication. "The early results were exciting. In a short time, many patients responded to the investigational treatment," says Hedy.
Her positive experience during these and subsequent clinical trials was largely why she joined in 1996. "wanted to be more involved in drug development and clinical trial design, and was doing some groundbreaking work in HIV," says Hedy, who now serves as executive director, Clinical Research, Infectious Diseases, at Research Laboratories.
The year before Hedy arrived, another prominent researcher and thought leader was keeping a close watch on Merck's work. Bach-Yen Nguyen, now retired-executive director, section head, and HIV, decided to leave the National Institutes of Health to work on Merck's research development team. Bach-Yen had spent years treating patients and working in research and saw great potential in Merck's work. "We were faced with an opportunity to help patients infected with HIV."
For Bach-Yen, who also made vital contributions to the development of another one of Merck's medicines for the treatment of HIV, the drug's approval continues to be her most memorable moment at Merck. "We worked long hours. There were times when couldn't attend school events with my son. When people asked him where was, he would say, 'Mom is busy helping people with AIDS.' He was only 12, but he understood the importance of the work."
Within a few years, the team achieved additional success: In 2011, the approved a chewable tablet form of this first agent in a new class of anti-agents for children 2 years and older, and in 2013, approved granules for oral suspension for infants 4 weeks and older. "Our pediatrics program has been extremely satisfying as there is a tremendous need for new anti-agents that can be used across the entire pediatric age range," says Hedy, who leads the Isentress pediatric development program.
 saw firsthand the difference vaccines make by helping prevent certain infectious diseases.
Tackling vaccine-preventable diseases is an especially rewarding area of health care.
Sixteen years ago, Paula Annunziato and Michelle Goveia met for the first time during an orientation for new employees. Both were already champions of vaccines, but neither could predict the life-changing journey ahead.
"During my hospital training as a physician, saw firsthand the difference vaccines make by helping prevent certain infectious diseases," recalls Paula Annunziato, M.D., vice president and therapeutic area head, Vaccines Clinical Research. "That's when knew wanted to play a role in vaccine development."
Michelle Goveia, M.D., MPH, medical director, Global Vaccines Medical Affairs, Vaccines, had witnessed similar success stories with vaccines while training at Children's National in Washington D.C., and, later, while working for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
"Tackling vaccine-preventable diseases is an especially rewarding area of health care," says Michelle. "cannot think of a better place than to carry out that work."
Director, Strategic Planning, Market Commercial Operations
In pharmaceutical manufacturing, you must adapt to a myriad of challenges.
Senior Field Specialist, Supplier Development and Performance Management
My work gives me the opportunity to grow and push myself outside my comfort zone.
Jennifer Wipf defines herself as "a professional problem solver." She's been sleuthing for our company's supply chain since 2005, when she joined the company right out of graduate school Stanford University.
"studied bioengineering and chemical engineering and was taught problem-solving skills, but they were problems on paper. In pharmaceutical manufacturing, you must adapt to a myriad of challenges that aren't always as clean as solving a math equation," says Jen.
One of the colleagues Jen mentored, Tonya Hutchison, shares a similar passion for untangling complex problems. "My work gives me the opportunity to grow and push myself outside my comfort zone," says Tonya.
Tonya joined in 2010, has a degree in biochemistry and molecular biology from Penn State University and completed her Masters of Business Administration from DeSales University in July 2016.
Both women have been recognized inside and outside of our company for their positive impact on the supply chain. Jen and Tonya each received a 2016 (Science, Technology, Engineering and Production) Ahead Award, given each year by The Manufacturing Institute to women who are making a difference in the manufacturing industry. Tonya was named an "Emerging Leader" and Jen was selected as a "Leaders in Manufacturing" Honoree.
Women have played an important role at throughout the company's history. Here are two former female scientists who have made huge advancements in human health.
During World War II, malaria was credited with the death of more soldiers than combat. The cause, in large part, was due to Japan's seizure of Dutch Cinchona plantations in Java in 1942. (Quinine, the preferred treatment of malaria at that time, is derived from the bark of the Cinchona tree).
The Allied troops needed help and answered the call. young researcher named Christine Malanga (later Christine Malanga Wilson) joined a team in Rahway, to test more than 600 plants from around the globe for activity against the disease.
The long hours and scientific rigor paid off. The team identified dozens of potential compounds. In 1947, Wilson co-authored a paper on the team's findings that was published in 
, a scientific journal that later became the 
The work would provide roots for new antimalarial research to this day.
Although Jean Kahan's name appears on several patents related to antibiotic discovery and production, she is perhaps best known for her work alongside her husband in the 1970s on thienamycin, a naturally occurring antibiotic, which in turn helped pave the way for the development of a new class of antibiotics, which can still be found on the World Health Organization's (WHO) Essential Medicines list today.
This is an exciting field and very humbling to be doing something that we hope will translate into longer lives for cancer patients.
"It's the beginning of a new era for immuno-oncology," says Terri McClanahan, executive director, Profiling Expression, Translational Medicine, Research Laboratories, about her work at Merck. "This is an exciting field and very humbling to be doing something that we hope will translate into longer lives for cancer patients."
Terri is among a number of top-notch scientists who have helped develop – and continue to expand – our oncology research program.
Terri's biomarker research group, based at our research labs in Palo, Alto, Calif., combines molecular, cellular and tissue-based approaches to understand how inflammatory diseases and cancer work, and how biologics can modulate the body's own immune system.
In order to make sure we select the right patients for treatment, and to make sure the drug is working the way we think it should, we do many studies to find biomarkers that we can follow when we treat patients," she says. 
am working to extend the benefits of our medicines to potentially help more patients.
Elaine Pinheiro, now a principal scientist in Biology-Discovery at Research Laboratories came to in 2011 from the Belfer Institute of Applied Cancer Sciences at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute where she served as a group leader in oncology target discovery and validation.
"am working to extend the benefits of our medicines to potentially help more patients. One way we hope to do that is through combination therapies," says Elaine. "am part of a group that conducts preclinical studies to understand how various combinations may work – and rule out combinations that won't."
Little by little, we hope that our work will change the course of public health.
When Shuangping Shi, director, Biologics Vaccines Bioanalytics, Biologics and Vaccines, Research Laboratories, joined Schering-Plough in 2006 from The Rockefeller University, she developed a proprietary protein expression system that has been at the forefront of cancer immunotherapy in the U.S.
In her current role, Shuangping looks at efficacy and safety measures to determine whether cancer drugs are binding to the target and activating the immune response. "The most exciting part of my job is when see if a drug is working," she says. "Little by little, we hope that our work will change the course of public health."
Gargi Maheshwari, Ph.D.
Associate Vice President, Global Vaccines Biologics Commercialization, Manufacturing Division
It is rewarding to be part of a team that is making a difference.
If Gargi looks familiar to you, there may be a good reason. In 2016, the hashtag #ILookLikeAnEngineer took social media channels by storm to protest stereotypes and celebrate women in the field of engineering. Gargi represented our company on Facebook and Twitter, helping to celebrate our diverse talent.
After graduating from in 1999, Gargi joined Research Laboratories' Vaccine Bioprocess Research Development team. While there, she worked on all aspects of process analytics and bioprocess development of mammalian cell culture-based viral vaccines, helping to develop manufacturing processes for making vaccines for use in clinical trials and eventual commercial supply.
Today, Gargi continues to focus on process development and commercialization for biologics. Her team works in close collaboration with biologics process development teams in Research Laboratories as well as commercial manufacturing, driving towards commercialization of biologics and providing manufacturing science and technology support to our commercial products.
Executive Vice President Chief Patient Officer, Strategic Communications, Global Public Policy and Population Health
We take on problems that affect large numbers of people.
From to Zika, Ebola to SARS, Julie Gerberding has long been at the forefront of many of the world's most pressing population health issues. Throughout her impressive career, the former director of the and Merck's newly named Chief Patient Officer has been driven by one thing – a passion for improving health and making a difference in people's lives.
Julie joined in 2010 as president of Vaccines where she helped to globalize the company's vaccines business – with particular focus on making our vaccines increasingly more available (and affordable) to people in emerging markets and in some of the world's poorest countries. She also helped lead the launch in India of the Wellcome Trust Hilleman Laboratories, a not-for-profit joint venture for vaccine development.
In December 2014, Julie took on a new leadership role, joining Merck's Executive Committee as executive vice president, Strategic Communications, Global Public Policy and Population Health; and in June 2016, she added another responsibility to her growing list of achievements: Chief Patient Officer. In this role, Julie will lead efforts to engage with patients and patient organizations to bring their perspectives into to help inform company decisions. She also represents our company globally on patient-related matters.
is, "a population health company," says Julie. "We take on problems that affect large numbers of people – infectious diseases, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer – and invent solutions that protect and preserve lives. That is truly a noble mission."

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
It's an unfortunate reality that many children in the United States don't have the guidance or the support structures in place needed to help them succeed in life.
volunteers are working to help fill this gap with at-risk children and young adults in their communities by working with Making Positive Choices, a volunteer program.
Making Positive Choices is administered in coordination with Street Law, Inc. - a nonprofit organization that creates classroom and community programs that teach people about law, democracy, and human rights worldwide. Street Law programs empower students and communities to become active, legally-savvy contributors to society.
volunteers teach law, health, community safety, career planning and advocacy to middle and high school students, and young adults aging out of foster care.
which concentrates on building life skills that help teens participate in their community as responsible citizens. Teams of volunteers partner with local schools in and to teach sessions on conflict resolution, bullying, diversity and bias awareness, and safety to middle school children.
which helps students explore future career possibilities. volunteers provide guidance to high school students on searching for a job and interviewing skills.
which provides at-risk youths who are aging out of the foster care system the assistance they need to develop basic life skills. In partnership with local residential programs, volunteers help empower youths transitioning out of foster care and provide guidance to help them live independently.
For Kirke Weaver, an Associate Vice President in our legal department, volunteering with Making Positive Choices was an easy decision.
enjoy working with young people and trying to make a difference (even a small one) in their lives...hope show that a career path is a journey; that they don't have to know at the age of 18 exactly how their life is going to play out and then giving them skills to adapt to those changes.
Many of the young people in the Making Positive Choices program lack the guidance or monitoring that can help with social and academic success. Volunteer and senior scientist Puja Malhotra says that the curriculum gives these kids an added boost – and it's a simple, yet beneficial, thing to do. "It's very easy to participate thanks to our training. truly believe is not just giving back to community but also giving an opportunity to volunteers to feel great and positive toward life."
Thomas Muller, who works in Merck's department, credits our innovative Global Employee Volunteerism Policy, which lets employees take 40 hours of paid time off to engage in volunteering efforts, for helping him find the time to devote to Making Positive Choices. "was initially concerned about the timing of the volunteer session being in the middle of the work day but my manager was fully supportive. When you see first-hand some of the challenges these kids face, through no fault of their own, it makes you want to pitch in and lend a hand to help them if you can."
employees have touched the lives of more than 3,600 young people in Making Positive Choices since its inception in 2010.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Millions of people around the world choose to fast for religious observances or for health reasons.
For people with diabetes, however, there are potential risks associated with fasting.
Decreased food intake can increase the risk of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). If left untreated, hypoglycemia can get worse and cause problems, including confusion, clumsiness, fainting, seizures and coma.
An increase in food and/or sugar intake (for instance, if overeating after a day of fasting) or a reduction in medications to prevent hypoglycemia can increase the risk of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia).
People with diabetes who make the personal decision to fast should do so after careful consideration of the associated risks following ample discussion with their treating physician.
Seek medical advice one to two months before starting a fast.
Speak to your healthcare professional about glucose monitoring, meal-planning, physical activity and dosage and timing of medications.
Learn to recognize some of the symptoms of hypoglycemia, which may include sweating, dizziness, hunger and confusion.
 in the first few hours after the start of fasting
has developed The Facts About Fasting program to support people with type 2 diabetes who fast during Ramadan.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Dr. Edward Jenner inoculating 8-year-old James Phipps with cowpox.
                            The story of modern day vaccines began in 1796 when Dr. Edward Jenner inoculated 8-year-old James Phipps with cowpox as a way to protect him from smallpox. Jenner used the term "vaccination," "vacca" being Latin for "cow." In fact, it has been recognized for centuries that some diseases never reinfect a person after recovery. Smallpox was the first disease people tried to prevent by intentionally inoculating themselves with infected matter.
                            Eight decades after Jenner published his findings, Louis Pasteur developed the first live attenuated bacterial vaccine. Attenuation is a process that weakens the bacteria or virus in a vaccine so it is less likely to cause disease, while still triggering an immune response similar to the natural infection. It would take many more decades for advances in basic and clinical research to make it possible for scientists to understand viruses well enough to begin developing vaccines that help protect against viral diseases.
                                The scientists who made giant strides in the fight against viral diseases included Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin. Dr. Maurice Hilleman, who led Merck's Department of Virus and Cell Biology from 1956 to 1984, also belonged to that distinguished group of vaccine pioneers. Credited with helping to develop more than forty vaccines, Dr. Hilleman's passionate commitment continues to inspire scientists in medical research laboratories to this day.
                                Dr. Hilleman was born and raised on a farm in Montana. It was a hard life, but a farm background was a great foundation for his later work. "When you are brought up on a farm, you have a lot of general knowledge," he said. After graduating from the University of Chicago with a doctorate in microbiology and chemistry, Hilleman chose to work at a pharmaceutical company instead of academia.
                                Despite his many accomplishments, including helping to develop more than 40 human and animal vaccines, Dr. Maurice Hilleman's name is virtually unknown by the general public and press. Yet his impact on public health is undeniable.
Since Pasteur, he's done more for preventive medicine than anyone else
His commitment was to make something useful and convert it to clinical use. Maurice's genius was in developing vaccines, reliably reproducing them, and he was in charge of all pharmaceutical facets from research to the marketplace.
                            In 1988, President Ronald Reagan awarded the National Medal of Science to Dr. Hilleman, and in 1997, he was honored with The Albert Sabin Gold Medal Award. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has called Dr. Hilleman
one of the true giants of science, medicine and public health in the 20th century.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
For more than a decade, Animal Health has contributed to the fight against rabies.
For more than 15 years, 
 (Afya means "health" in Swahili) in the Serengeti region of Tanzania in eastern Africa. We help provide access to preventive care, including rabies vaccinations for local dogs. To date, we have donated two million rabies vaccines to support  programs in India, Malawi, Sri Lanka, Tanzania and Uganda. We also provide tools such as all-terrain vehicles and tents to help make sure the project is able to reach the most remote corners of the region.
 Rabies in humans and domestic animals has now been virtually eliminated from this area and human hospitalizations due to rabid dog bites have decreased 92 percent.
                                    The success of the Afya Serengeti project inspired Animal Health to extend our support to the 
 project in India. Mission Rabies focuses on hotspots within India and Africa – vaccinating and educating schools and communities on the importance of rabies awareness and vaccination. Mission Rabies is still in its early stages and Animal Health believes our support is vital to its success in providing vaccines and supporting the collection of dog population and disease data.
Africa and India together bear the burden of 80 percent of total annual rabies deaths.
Rabies affects domestic and wild animals. Dogs are the source of the vast majority of human rabies deaths. While not much of a threat in industrialized countries because of widespread and effective programs to prevent dog to human transmission, rabies remains a common and dangerous threat in many parts of the world.
Did you Know...
Rabies is...
caused by a virus that attacks the nervous system and is transmitted between species through a bite or scratch from an infected person or animal.
exposure to rabid dogs is still the cause of more than 90 percent of human exposures to rabies and of more than 99 percent of human deaths worldwide.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
 anniversary as a global health care leader. We created this page as a celebration of our accomplishments as well as to highlight what we're excited about for the years to come. 
This is an exciting time for our company and the world.
Today, we are at the forefront of inventing tools for the fight against some of the world’s most urgent global health challenges. This includes more than 30 different cancers, hepatitis C, Alzheimer’s disease, Ebola, antibiotic-resistant "superbugs," cardio-metabolic diseases, and many others.
Since our inception in 1891, has pushed the boundaries of science with the hope and expectation that advancing scientific knowledge will lead to major advances in health. has changed the world repeatedly through our history – from the development of the first vaccines for measles and mumps and the first vaccine for that causes cervical and other cancers, to the development of ground-breaking medicines for heart disease, osteoporosis, diabetes, tuberculosis, and melanoma, just to name a few.
We are guided by a rich legacy and inspired by a shared vision to improve the health and well-being of people around the world. We are fortunate to have had many pioneers lead the way for over the last 125 years.  Business leaders including our founder George Merck, and his son, late and former president George Merck, well-known for his "medicine is for the people" speech, laid the groundwork for the company we are today.
And then there are our legendary scientists — among them, Maurice Hilleman and Bill Campbell, who each spent more than 25 years with Merck, and whose impact on public health is unmatched and undeniable. 
At his death, The New York Times said that Dr. Hilleman "is credited with having developed more human and animal vaccines than any other scientist, helping to extend human life expectancy and improving the economies of many countries."
These are among countless examples of people at who have achieved immeasurable success and the many more to come.
			                  	has also had a long history of leading the way in corporate responsibility, including our 
, through which we have donated more than one billion treatments in areas affected by river blindness. Now, three countries have been verified as free of river blindness by the World Health Organization.
			                 	Today, we are also making important strides in the fight against maternal mortality through 
"In part because of Merck, the world today is a healthier, stronger and more hopeful world," said Chairman and Ken Frazier. "And our future will be even better — because of our people, our partners and our unwavering commitment to finding new ways, every day, to meet unmet medical needs."
Chairman and CEO, Our goal as a premier biopharmaceutical company is to build on this remarkable legacy of invention and scientific discovery. But, in our desire to continue to invent medicines that will improve the lives of more and more people around the world, we see as more than a biopharmaceutical company: we are people on a quest to cure.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
The Milestones in Microbiology program recognizes institutions and scientists that have made significant contributions
toward advancing the science of microbiology.
Rahway is the birthplace of many of our company’s earliest innovations in health care.
This small city, 20 miles south west of New York City, was where our founder, George Merck, decided to stake his claim as his company grew out of the confines of New York City. In 1903, he settled on 150 acres in Rahway and started out with only 20 employees, two buildings, and two working telephones.
It was in Rahway where he decided his company would focus on pharmaceutical research in addition to chemical manufacturing. An idea continued by his son, George Merck, who transformed the Rahway offices into a university-like setting to help attract top talent, including academic researchers.
As our research and development continued, this part of the company became known as Research Laboratories (MRL). In our Rahway labs, scientists conducted pioneering microbiology research, including work that led to the development of a number of life-saving anti-infective products. In 1952, we expanded and opened another facility in West Point, Pa., focusing on vaccine research and development.
In 1956, Maurice Hilleman became the facility’s director of virus and cell biology research. During his tenure, Hilleman and his team developed many life-saving vaccines.
Take a look back at some archival images from our Rahway facility
Our interactive gallery is viewable on tablets in horizontal view and on desktops. 
In recognition of the antimicrobial work done in Rahway and West Point and the resulting benefits to human and animal health, these two campuses have been designated as Milestone in Microbiology sites by the American Society for Microbiology.The Milestones in Microbiology program recognizes institutions and scientists that have made significant contributions toward advancing the science of microbiology. is the first company to receive this recognition.
is honored to be acknowledged as an Milestone in Microbiology site for our strong legacy of anti-infective and vaccine research, especially in our 125th year as a global health care leader. We are fortunate to have had many pioneers lead the way for over the years, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to treating and preventing infectious diseases. 
The Milestones in Microbiology program, spearheaded by the ASM, recognizes institutions (and their scientists) who have made significant contributions toward advancing the science of microbiology. Every year, the program places explanatory plaques at the sites to help increase recognition of the science of microbiology.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Be Safe in the Sun
                            Your skin is your body’s largest and fastest-growing organ. Its jobs are numerous: It protects you from germs and helps to regulate your body temperature. Your skin protects you and keeps you healthy. So why not do the same and protect it from harmful rays?
Here are a few ways to help keep your skin safe this summer season
Harmful exposure is greatest between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. and less in the early morning and late afternoon. Experts recommend staying inside during those hours. However, if you need to be outside during these peak hours, try to seek shade, whether under a tree, an umbrella or an awning, to help limit your exposure to rays.
Help protect your face — not to mention the top of your head, ears and neck — with a hat that sports a wide brim to cover exposed skin. As the American Cancer Society notes, although baseball caps can protect your face and scalp, they miss your neck and ears, places where skin cancers commonly develop. Try to find a hat with at least a 2-to 3-inch brim.
Not all cover-ups are created equal. Avoid clothes that you can see light through. Remember: If light is getting through, then ultraviolet radiation is getting through, too. The weave of your clothing is also important. The tighter the knit or weave, the smaller the holes and the less can get through. Some manufacturers provide extra-protective clothing with (Ultraviolet Protection Factor) labels, which indicate exactly how protective the clothes are: shirt with a of 45 lets in just 1/45th of the sun's UV.
No sunscreen protects you completely – but it does help. The Skin Cancer Foundation recommends using a broad spectrum (UVA/UVB) sunscreen with an of 15 or higher every day. If you’ll be outdoors for a longer period of time, try using a water-resistant, broad spectrum (UVA/UVB) sunscreen with an of 30 or higher. The American Cancer Association suggests applying about an ounce (think: a shot glass or palmful) to cover the arms, legs, neck, and face of the average adult and administering it about 30 minutes before sun exposure to help it bind to your skin. Be sure to reapply every two hours or so to help keep you protected and pay special attention to those areas of skin which may not be fully protected by clothing.
                            If you want extra protection from the sun, the Skin Cancer Foundation suggests applying your sunscreen before you put on your bathing suit.
You are adding extra protection to the skin underneath your suit.
You are less likely to miss a spot, which can lead to burning around the edges of your suit.
Pick a pair that will block as close to 100% of both and rays as possible. Research has shown that radiation increases the likelihood of certain cataracts.
Before you head outside, you can check the radiation levels from the sun online at the 
. The also offers instructions for how to download their free Index smartphone app, so you can check while you’re on the move.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Innovation is the lifeblood of Merck. That's why we continue to invest in research development. Yet investment alone is not enough to guarantee success.
Drug research is a high-risk and time-consuming process. Only 1 out of every 5000-10,000 compounds screened becomes an approved drug. It takes an average of 10 to 15 years at an average cost of more than US$1 billion to develop a successful medicine.
To deliver important products to the people who need them, we need a global environment that supports the following enabling factors:
 Strong and enforceable patent laws act as incentives that encourage innovation, reward innovators, and lead to public dissemination of important scientific information and advances. 
 competition-based healthcare market allows firms that develop new medicines to earn an adequate return on their investment and to fund future research. 
 By supporting basic biomedical research, the government helps to increase general understanding about disease. Pharmaceutical researchers apply the knowledge gained in basic research in their quest for new medicines. also believes that broader support of science and technology, including strong science programs in schools, ultimately helps to create an environment that advances innovation.
Evidence-based Regulatory Environment:
 regulatory system that is effective, transparent and puts patients first by approving marketing applications for products demonstrated to be safe and effective also is critical.
 Free market principles, ethical business practices, competitive tax policies, free trade and other factors increase the opportunity for innovative firms to be rewarded for their investments.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
The physician and scientist reflects on her work advocating for patients with lung cancer in clinical trials.
                           Dr. Cathy Pietanza is a physician and a distinguished scientist at Research Laboratories. thoracic oncologist by training, Cathy saw patients with lung cancer daily in her clinical practice, experiencing the highs and lows of their cancer journeys. She also saw how participating in clinical trials impacted their care. 
Cathy explains how that experience shapes how she views her current work to 
 and help improve outcomes for cancer patients.
You are an oncologist. How does shape the way you approach work  at Merck?
 Before coming to Merck, had an active practice in an academic setting where cared for patients with lung cancer. shared their triumphs and joys with them, as well as their hardships. Each day, I’m reminded of my patients with lung cancer who have participated in clinical trials. Working to make a difference in this fight has become one of my personal missions.
What do you do on
am one of the clinical directors at Research Laboratories, focused on lung cancer clinical trials. We oversee and monitor studies during the course of the trial, ensure that safety and protocol standards are maintained, provide medical perspectives, and advocate for patients. also lead our work to ensure clean and complete data. then file documents for regulatory approvals based on that data.
What is it like for a patient to be diagnosed with metastatic lung cancer?
Life for these patients seems like it’s completely broken and changed. “lifetime” suddenly feels like it has new meaning. Days are full of doctors’ appointments and tests. Living with lung cancer seems to become the new normal.
What is the most exciting thing about working on Merck’s clinical development program?
Being part of a team that is working to change cancer care so patients can spend more time with their loved ones. have never worked with a more dedicated group of professionals with a common mission.
What is the future of cancer treatment? What role do you believe will play in that future?
We need to dedicate resources to research and develop therapies that will be curative. has made a commitment in oncology. With the ongoing work of scientists and physicians, know we will have a pivotal role to play in that future.
Medical advances can only happen through the efforts of many people, especially the patients who volunteer for clinical trials. They are our partners in research.

                            People with type 2 diabetes should work with their doctors to set individual goals to manage the ABCs of diabetes — that's 
 for blood pressure and 
America's Diabetes Challenge: Get to Your Goals
 is a program from and the American Diabetes Association to raise awareness among people with type 2 diabetes about the importance of working with their doctors to set and reach their A1goals. The program also aims to help them learn if they are at risk of low blood glucose and how to help reduce that risk.
 is a test that shows what your average blood glucose has been over the past two to three months.
Thousands of people across the country shared through the program that type 2 diabetes management isn’t always easy, and four common challenges were identified – eating healthy, exercising, sticking to a treatment plan and coping with the disease.
Now, America’s Diabetes Challenge is offering tips to help people with type 2 diabetes and their loved ones tackle these challenges head on.
Take the next step to check out the tips and put them into action! Whether you decide to cook a new healthy recipe or take the stairs instead of the elevator, share a picture, story or video on 
 so we can see your progress. 
Through America's Diabetes Challenge, has teamed up with the American Diabetes Association and several important voices to reach the millions of people affected by the disease and to speak about how important it is for those living with type 2 diabetes to work with their doctors to set and reach their A1goal. This year, the program is encouraging people to take the next step and tackle some common diabetes management challenges head on.
Award-winning artist Tim McGraw is a strong believer in making healthy choices, and that's why he is encouraging people to join him in challenging their family and friends with diabetes to get to their A1goals.
In the U.S., African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos are nearly twice as likely to develop type 2 diabetes as non-Hispanic whites. To support these at-risk communities, has also continued to team up with celebrated film, stage and television actress, Epatha Merkerson, and Chef Leticia Moreinos Schwartz. Together, they are encouraging and inspiring people with type 2 diabetes to take on America’s Diabetes Challenge tips to address some common diabetes management challenges.
Karrie was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2004. She has a family history with the disease, but when Karrie was growing up she was initially afraid and unsure of how her life was going to be affected.
It’s been a struggle for Karrie. She works closely with her doctor to set and follow a management plan that works for her. While it’s been a difficult journey, Karrie refuses to give up and she’s taking the next step with America’s Diabetes Challenge by facing her challenges head on.
I’m trying to reign my A1back in through diet and exercise, and the different programs and treatment plans that come up with my doctor.
                            main goal of type 2 diabetes management is to manage your blood glucose and to reach the A1goal you’ve established with your doctor. About one-third of adults with diabetes are not at their A1goal. The American Diabetes Association recommends that people with diabetes have an individualized A1goal; the goal for many adults with diabetes is less than 7 percent. higher or lower goal may be appropriate for some people, which is why it is important for people with diabetes to speak with their doctors about what goals are right for them.
                            Many people with diabetes are aware of the importance of managing high blood glucose through diet, exercise and medicine (if prescribed), but they may not know that blood glucose can also go too low. This is known as hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia may be caused by skipping meals, excessive exercise and certain diabetes medicines, and can make you feel shaky, dizzy, sweaty or hungry and, sometimes, faint. If left untreated, hypoglycemia may lead to a seizure or loss of consciousness. People living with diabetes should work with their doctors to learn to recognize the signs and symptoms of both high and low blood glucose, and talk to their doctors if they are experiencing any problems with high and low blood glucose.
                                If you are one of the millions of Americans living with type 2 diabetes, or if you would like to support those with the disease, visit

However, this vital and finite resource is under serious threat.
                            Our water quality and conservation efforts support our Environmental Sustainability strategy, one of four key pillars in our 
 – of the world's water is fresh water available for use. growing world population (estimated to increase from 7.5 billion in 2018 to more than 9 billion by 2050) and impacts associated with climate change and land use are putting our fresh water resources at risk.
                                    In many parts of the world, even where fresh water is abundant, inadequate sanitation facilities and insufficient regulation jeopardize water supplies, making the water unsafe for drinking, bathing or cooking. Consumption of contaminated water can result in life-threatening disease.
                                    Our business, suppliers, communities and customers all need access to clean water, and we are committed to managing the environmental impacts of our products throughout their life cycles–from discovery through manufacturing, use and disposal.
Our global water strategy aims to achieve sustainable water management within our operations and our supply chain.
 reflects our public commitment to adopt and implement a comprehensive approach to water management.
                            In addition to conserving limited supplies of clean water and reducing environmental impact, efficient use of water reduces our operating spend by reducing the amount of energy used to pump water and the cost of water treatment. Over the last 5 years, we have reduced our global water use by 36 percent.  Our new water goals are to maintain global water use at or below 2015 levels through 2025, and to implement water conservation plans for our  sites in locations facing high levels of water stress by 2020.
Here are just a couple of examples of how our manufacturing sites are reducing water use:
Our Danville, Pennsylvania site in the completed a water-reduction project that won the Pennsylvania Governor’s Award for Environmental Excellence. The project included reducing the use of once-through cooling water, installing an upgraded closed-loop cooling system and fitting cooling water distribution pumps with variable frequency drives. The project has saved approximately 0.7 billion gallons of water over the past two years.
Our site in Campinas, Brazil, is upgrading its on-site industrial wastewater treatment plant. The project will provide for reuse of at least 15,850 gallons per day of treated effluent as make-up water in the site’s cooling towers. This corresponds to a site water savings of approximately 5.8 million gallons per year. This will help ensure sufficient future site water supply in a region that has recently experienced drought conditions.
Also crucial to reducing water usage in our

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
                            Point of View by Dr. Gregory Lubiniecki, Director, Oncology Clinical Research,
Dr. Lubiniecki, like many physicians, continues to see patients. This is his personal perspective.
Interested in joining Gregory in our mission
As  every oncologist knows, it’s cancer’s unpredictability that   makes the disease  such a challenge. When we discover ways to block one   route of tumor growth,  cancer cells figure out another way to grow,   spread, and potentially kill. 
And  among cancer types, lung cancer is a particularly elusive target. 
The  reason is biological. Researchers blame lung cancer’s high   “mutational load.”  In other words, lung cancer changes so quickly that   finding consistent ways to  destroy it is often a lost cause. And so the   outcome is sobering: Lung cancer  kills more people than colon, breast   and prostate cancers – combined. This is a  reality for those of us who   treat lung cancer patients on a daily basis. 
Although  these statistics are disheartening, do believe we   live in a hopeful time. When  see patients who know they are facing a   difficult journey, they often want to  know what their options are. As a   physician and researcher, it is my goal to  help patients identify the   best path forward, and ideally, contribute to the  development of new   options that may help in their treatment. As recently as a  few years   ago, patients would have been severely limited in their choices. Now,    there are multiple paths forward. 
Our  understanding of the biology of lung cancer has taken leaps   that allow us to help  predict, with much greater precision, which drugs   will have the greatest  likelihood of success for which patients. Some   lung tumors are vulnerable, for  a time, because they were set in motion   by a single mutation – referred to as a  driver mutation – that can be   more precisely targeted.
So  while there is still much to be done, we are also making   strides. It’s progress  like this that allows us to continue to have   hope. Companies such as understand  how enormous the unmet need   has been in lung cancer. Our own lives have been  touched, and sometimes   devastated, by the disease. Our passion towards finding  new ways to   manage the disease continues, one step, one patient, one  breakthrough,   at a time.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
                        medical oncologist and vice president, Global Clinical Oncology, Research Laboratories
Few innovations have helped as many as the advent of the modern clinical trial, especially in cancer research. Without these important studies, doctors, regulators, patients and caregivers would not be able to determine what kinds of medicines may help patients, or the potential risks.
While the idea that we can carefully evaluate new medicines is taken for granted today, the clinical trial as it is understood today dates back only to the 1940s. Prior to that time, hucksters could – and did – push useless or harmless “cures” on anyone. It's no coincidence that the great leaps forward in medicine, such as antibiotics, are closely linked with the adoption of clinical trials as the gold standard for understanding a medicine’s effects.
The basic foundations of the randomized, blinded clinical trial – comparing different groups of otherwise-similar patients and ensuring that neither doctor nor patient is aware of who receives what treatment – have proven their value. But our recent work at is focused on ensuring that the clinical trials system advances and works more effectively. Quicker, smarter ways of conducting clinical trials means that we can answer scientific questions more quickly and more confidently, allowing more patients access to medicines that may potentially help them.
In some cases, we have worked closely with regulators to modify ongoing trials to enroll more patients and gather more data. New rules around “breakthrough” products have allowed more collaboration with the FDA, and this kind of collaboration has helped and others in the pharmaceutical industry to quickly gather the data needed to demonstrate the potential benefit of new treatment options.
Our immuno-oncology research program has been one area where we’ve been able to use these new tools. We have had the opportunity–when the early trials show promise–to expand studies to gather additional high-quality data, helping advance the potential for bringing medicines to cancer patients.
The design of Merck's oncology trials, too, is becoming more innovative. We have made important strides in developing new trial designs that allow us to evaluate multiple types of cancers in one study. This, in turn, makes it more likely that we can identify potential new medicines in a more efficient manner. The years to come are likely to see more such trials helping us to better answer questions on the best way to treat cancer.
But clinical trials can only advance cancer research if patients volunteer to participate. is committed to helping educate patients, doctors and caregivers about oncology clinical trials. For more on our approach on clinical trials and ongoing clinical trials, please visit

Our Pricing Practices: Under the Microscope
Year two of our pricing transparency report shows we continue to price responsibly.
Last year, was the first pharmaceutical company to publish a multi-year report about our pricing practices, including the rebates and discounts we provide to payers in the United States.  We did this to help people better understand our practices and the importance of rebates and discounts in looking at the overall drug pricing picture. We also said we would continue providing that information each year.
 for 2017 is now available. The average discount rate across our product portfolio, after rebates, discounts and returns are taken into account, was 45.1 percent in 2017, and the average annual net price across our portfolio declined by 1.9 percent. The 2017 figures reflect specific in-year dynamics, including the impact of loss of patent protection for three major medicines.
These data points for 2017, and the years before that, show that continues to be responsible in our approach, and that the competitive marketplace for pharmaceuticals is working.
In fact, growth in spending on retail prescription drugs in the United States was 1.3 percent in 2016, its lowest rate in recent years.  And over time, spending on all prescription medicines (branded and generic) has remained at less than 15 percent of total health expenditures in the United States.
Even so, health care spending overall is increasing. Overall health care spending is predicted to grow to 20 percent of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2025. In addition, the out-of-pocket costs paid by consumers for health care services are projected to increase each year through 2025.  These trends are not sustainable and must be addressed.
We know that medicines and vaccines need to be a part of the solution, and that we, as a pharmaceutical company, have to do better at finding ways to help our customers plan for and afford the inventions that we bring forward.
You can learn more about some of the specific things we are doing on this page.  But ultimately, reducing spending on medicines alone will never be enough to address the increasing cost of health care.
More importantly, we know that the interventions we have today in our medicine cabinets and on our hospital shelves are not enough – cancer deaths are expected to cost the United States an estimated $148 billion in lost productivity by 2020.  We have to ensure that the overall system continues to reward companies like that invest billions each year in the quest to invent new medicines and vaccines that have the promise to provide better health for generations to come.
is continuing to do our part to improve access and affordability, and to address the broader affordability issues in our health system – while never relenting in our pursuit to invent new medicines that address critical unmet medical needs in areas such as cancer and infectious diseases. Here are a few examples:
invested over $7 billion in R&in 2017 and more than $60 billion since 2010.
In 2017, we introduced our first biosimilar in the United States at a list price of 35 percent below the list price of its reference product.
We support the role of generic drug manufacturers in providing low cost products once intellectual property rights have expired, and we advocate for policy changes in the United States to speed access to generic drugs and increase generic competition.
Both in the United States and globally, we are working with a broad range of stakeholders to help develop and advance innovative financing and payment models with the objective of improving access.
In the United States, where patients share in the cost of their health care, we have 
 to help eligible patients who cannot afford their medications.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
“We aspire to not only make a great impact on our company, but on the entire field of chemistry. ”
Across the biopharmaceutical industry, it takes many scientists many years to design, make and test thousands of new molecules in order to find the one or two that may be tested in clinical trials.
For many, the lingering question remains: What can be done to speed up the drug discovery timeline and make it more efficient? 
Merck’s Discovery Chemistry team, the scientists who design, make and test new molecules in the hopes of finding new drug candidates, is working hard at — and investing in — doing just that. 
Since the earliest days of Merck, our labs have pioneered new methods of chemical synthesis. These capabilities laid the foundation for our leadership in research and development.  
Advancing our chemistry capabilities remains a focus of improving our drug discovery efforts. Recently, scientists published a series of papers in top scientific journals describing new techniques that allow for the synthesis of new chemical matter on a miniature, or nanomole scale (think a bead of liquid the size of a needle point). By scaling down this process, the team is able to make and screen new molecules in a high-throughput manner, greatly speeding up the process.
We have invested in new state-of-the-art laboratories to expand our miniaturized ultra-high-throughput synthesis and automation capabilities. With these new tools, the speed of synthesis is not only hundreds of times faster, but also uses only a fraction of materials, compared to conventional methods, saving time and precious resources.
Why is there a need for speed?
“When we set out to design new molecules, we work in a chemical space with novemdecillion possibilities,” says Spencer Dreher, principal scientist, High Throughput Experimentation and Lead Discovery Capabilities.  (“novemdecillion” is a 10 with 60 zeros.)  “We're aiming to accelerate the design, make and test cycle in small-molecule drug discovery to deliver results faster.” 
While these new methods for ultra-high-throughput compound synthesis are indeed faster, this doesn’t mean we can’t push the process even more. The ultimate goal? “One day, we hope to enable the seamless integration of chemical synthesis with a biological screen. This would allow us to make and test molecules for activity against specific targets faster and more efficiently,” adds Spencer.
Recently, our Discovery teams discovered new methods to test the potency of new compounds, also using a miniaturized platform. This new approach is hundreds of times faster than existing methods and uses very small amounts of material (this invention and early results were highlighted in the prestigious scientific publication Nature).
Berengere Sauvagnat, an associate principal scientist, Pharmacology, was the co-author on the Nature article and one of the primary researchers on this new process. “By merging our miniaturized synthesis platform with a biochemical assay, we hope to streamline the hunt for new drug candidates,” she notes. “We are excited by early evidence suggesting that we are on a path to reducing the number of steps in the drug discovery process.”
“We aspire to have a greater impact on our company and on the field of chemistry than at any other time in our history,” says Emma Parmee, vice president, Head Discovery Chemistry. “I’m excited by the direction our journey is heading and hopeful that our discoveries will lead to new options for patients.”

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
may be 125-years-old, but we're thinking young.
Currently, 26 percent of our global workforce is comprised of millennials (any person born between 1981 and 1997). They are involved in every area of our business from research and development to legal to communications to to engineering to manufacturing.
So, what’s it like for these ambitious young professionals to work at Merck? We’ll let them tell you in their own words. 
The Pew Research Center classifies any person born from 1981 to 1997 as a Millennial.
In 2015, Millennials surpassed Generation to become the largest generation in the American workforce, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data.

How Will You Invent the Future?
My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
By Michael Nally, executive vice president, chief marketing officer, Vaccination is considered one of the greatest public health success stories of the last two centuries and has helped prevent millions of contagious, and in some cases, life-threatening diseases. Globally, vaccines have eradicated or significantly decreased diseases, such as smallpox and polio. While it is important to recognize and remember the past achievements of vaccination, we must continue our work to address challenges that still exist today.   
Our increasingly interconnected world continues to create a number of challenges for infectious disease prevention, and each day our scientists work to discover and develop new vaccines and approaches. Serious disease outbreaks force us to rethink how we address and prepare for potential global pandemics. And the threat of emerging infectious diseases challenges us to find new vaccines where previously none existed. We need to continue to focus on the most promising science to address significant unmet needs around the world. 
Making vaccines available to more people around the world and increasing vaccination rates is not only critical to protecting global public health, it is part of our core values as a company. According to a report from released in July 2018, a record number of infants were vaccinated in 2017 yet there are still more than 19 million children around the world that miss out on vaccinations. We will continue to work with partners in the global health community to find new approaches to expanding access to our vaccines.                    
In response to this unmet need, our employees are working hard to increase the total number of doses that we can supply. In fact, since 2010, we have increased the total number of doses supplied globally by approximately 70%. But our work is not done; we are continuing to invest in manufacturing capacity and end-to-end supply improvements to help meet growing worldwide demand. 
“Passionate” is the word that comes to mind when think about our employees. Whether on the research, manufacturing, or commercial side, have witnessed this passion time and again.  As we look to the future, am committed to investing in and supporting our people, which is critical to achieving our goal of helping to protect current and future generations from vaccine-preventable diseases.
For more than a century, has been inventing vaccines for many of the world's most challenging diseases. It is a legacy of prevention we live every day, built upon our commitment to inventing for a healthier future, and it is this commitment that will continue to drive us forward for a more hopeful tomorrow.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
As one of the people who helps oversee Merck’s manufacturing facilities, part of my job  is to ensure sustainability through good stewardship of water resources, while making sure our sites operate responsibly and safely. Access to clean water is critical for human health and is key to our manufacturing operations.
We’ve improved water stewardship in our manufacturing division by working to minimize our water use and impact by:
Reducing water use over the past 6 years by 30 percent, for example by conserving water used for heating and cooling, which has a positive impact both financially and for the environment
Returning water safely to the environment
Carefully choosing our partners, not only from a financial or quality perspective, but also from an environmental view.
As the senior vice president for Global Biologics, Therapeutic Proteins Sterile Operations, believe we can all become more thoughtful about how much water we use, and we can share best practices with our colleagues. Becoming better stewards and practicing sustainable water use will better guarantee that the water will be there for us when we need it – for our business and for society. 
Our vision is to be the most trusted and competitive supplier of pharmaceuticals, animal health products, vaccines and biologics to the world’s patients and customers. 
Our global water strategy aims to achieve sustainable water management within our operations and our supply chain. 
In September 2015, the 193 Member States of the United Nations came together to create a plan for achieving a better future for all. Their goal is an ambitious one — they want to help end extreme poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and protect our planet. This proposal is called  “Agenda 2030” and is comprised of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which clearly define how to help create a better world.  Fulfilling these SDGs will take an unprecedented effort, and for business they represent an opportunity to benefit society while growing and sustaining our business.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Under a microscope, classical Hodgkin lymphoma looks like any other cancer: cells out of control, crowding out healthy cells. But when we first diagnose classical Hodgkin lymphoma in patients, something is different than with many other cancers: the patients are frequently young, with a median age of 39. For those patients, cancer is an even more unexpected part of their lives.
For young people, their first reaction to the diagnosis can be an immediate willingness to throw everything they have at the disease, knowing that the odds are with them. And, the good news for many patients is that chemotherapy can offer a cure.
The difficult part of the story is that cures are not a given. For 10 to 20 percent of patients, the cancer comes back, and treatment options shrink. Some patients may see success with a stem-cell transplant. But, where that isn’t an option or it doesn’t work and treatments fail to lead to a cure (what physicians call refractory disease), we, as oncologists and hematologists, have a difficult task. We must face a young person – perhaps a recent college graduate starting a family and career, or a parent with young children, and explain that there are limited options left to them.
But, research has shown that certain cancers, including classical Hodgkin lymphoma, have a weak spot: to evade the body’s immune system, these cancers express specific proteins that mask the cancer. Inhibiting those proteins with a new therapeutic approach called immuno-oncology can give the body a chance to fight back. The medical community is now learning about how an immuno-oncology approach can work in this cancer.  This knowledge has provided the platform for attacking the cancer in patients who have few options, and is rigorously testing this approach.
Providing patients with another chance to help beat cancer is gratifying. At Merck, our goal is to continue the tradition of progress in classical Hodgkin lymphoma, giving all people battling this cancer yet another opportunity to put up a fight.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Investing in Inclusive Business and Diverse Suppliers
Not only does it benefit our local communities, it also provides a distinct competitive advantage for business
By Quentin Roach, chief procurement officer and senior vice president, Global Supplier Management Group and Global Workplace Enterprise Services
At Merck, we are committed to diversity and inclusion. We believe it is fundamental to our success. 
As such, we strive to foster a culture of inclusion and belonging where all employees feel welcomed and valued — a culture where we regard every individual as a source of competitive advantage in our larger mission of saving and improving lives.
This philosophy doesn’t just stop with whom we hire and advance but also with whom we do business.
One of my main roles as Merck’s chief procurement officer and senior vice president, Global Supplier Management Group and Global Workplace Enterprise Services, is overseeing our economic inclusion and  supplier diversity processes.
Supplier diversity is a business strategy that encourages the use of businesses owned by minorities, women, veterans, persons with disabilities or members of the community. It also extends to small business owners on a global scale: economic inclusion brings in rural and other relevant business definitions in various countries around the world.
Many may wonder why we work so hard to “cast a wide net” to attract business partners. The simple answer is: it works.
2015 study by The Hackett Group states that on average, supplier diversity programs add $3.6 million to the bottom line for every $1 million in procurement operation costs.
Investing in diverse suppliers doesn’t just make economic sense; we believe that it helps grow the economy, create employment opportunities, and make the communities in which we live, work and operate better for all.  It also benefits our company to better understand and anticipate the needs of the people we serve.  Our patients are not from just one race or religion or nationality or background — we provide for everyone. Our suppliers should reflect the people we are in business to serve... our customers.
Since started this program in 2005, we have seen a tremendous overall growth of our program globally, and in the U.S., in particular, where, in 2017, we achieved membership in the Billion Dollar Roundtable (BDR) – an organization that recognizes corporations who have been able to achieve $1 billion of annual spend with women-owned (WBE) and minority-owned (MBE) enterprises. is one of 27 companies who have received this status.
While we are proud to be recognized as a leader in the area of supplier diversity, that doesn’t mean we can rest. We look continuously for ways to expand and improve our program and to have greater economic impact around the globe; that’s not just good for our local communities, it’s also good for business.

How Will You Invent the Future?
My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
By Robert Davis, executive vice president, Global Services, and chief financial officer
Earlier this year, the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers released a study – the 2018 Global Innovation 1000 Study – which found that was in the top 10 of R&investors. Not just in the United States – but in the world.
We were glad to see that – but we weren’t surprised. As CFO, know that one of the most important investments we make at is in R&– about $7 billion a year over the last five years.  We make those sustained investments year after year to build on the momentum we have today in oncology, vaccines, animal health and other crucial areas – and in the hope that we will invent even more medicines and vaccines that can make a difference in the world.
Creating the space where that research can take place and where the more than 19,000 people in Research Labs can invent new medicines and vaccines means buildings and infrastructure and cutting-edge labs. And, because invention is not enough, we need the manufacturing facilities, capabilities and global supply chains to produce these medicines and vaccines and distribute them around the world, whether for people, pets or livestock.
That’s why last month we announced an endeavor of an unprecedented scope for our company: we will invest $16 billion in capital projects over the next five years.  That is in addition to our annual investment in R&
While Merck* is a global company, the United States is where we have been based for more than 125 years, and where 25,000 of our employees live. am proud to say that more than 
$9 billion of these investments will be spent here in the United States
portion of these investments will go toward expanding our vaccine production capacity to the highest levels we have ever reached – because demand for vaccines globally is the highest it has ever been. For example, we plan to more than triple the global distribution of our vaccines from our 2017 base over the next five years. We know that we have an essential role in supporting vaccination efforts around the world, and we want to do our part.
These are sizable investments, to be sure. And they have some risk as well. Just as we don’t know if the money we invest in R&will result in a new medicine, we build our facilities based on expectations of what the demand will be five and ten years from now. But placing those long bets is what has made who we are today – because we invest not just for the next quarter, but for the next generation.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Meet two of the women at who are on a mission to help eradicate 'important' threats to public health.
Amanda Paschke and Mary Beth Dorr are among our scientists leading the fight against some of the world's toughest bacterial infections.
Amanda Paschke, M.D., is fascinated with bugs, specifically, those tiny but complex organisms known as bacteria, and the clinical syndromes they cause. "When decided to become a doctor, was attracted by the puzzles in infectious diseases... love microbiology and working across a variety of areas of medicine, so infectious diseases was the perfect fit."
The confounding world of microorganisms also is what attracted Mary Beth Dorr, Ph.D., to the field. "It's like solving a logic problem. Each type of organism at each site of infection brings different challenges."
Amanda and Mary Beth each lead clinical development programs in the Infectious Disease Clinical Research group in Research Laboratories (MRL). Although their programs are different, the goal is the same: to address the health threats deemed "important" by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization.
Before joining in 2010, Amanda was an instructor in pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) School of Medicine and a post-doctoral fellow at the UPenn Center for Evidence-Based Practice. She received her medical degree from the State University of New York Health Sciences Center at Brooklyn and her Master of Science in Clinical Epidemiology (MSCE) degree from UPenn. She completed her residency in pediatrics and a fellowship in pediatric infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
Working at offered me the opportunity to do the clinical research in infectious diseases that love, while also having the opportunity to impact some critical areas in public health, such as difficult-to-treat infections.
Today, Amanda leads a program evaluating the treatment of acute bacterial infections.
As program lead, Amanda has oversight for the entire late-stage development program. "We are working toward being in a position to submit our first regulatory filing, so most of our activities are focused on that right now. It's an exciting time."
It also is a time of rapid change in the regulatory landscape for antibiotics. "Multi-drug-resistant bacteria are a public health crisis," says Amanda. "Because of this crisis, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other agencies have issued guidance for streamlined drug development, and have created opportunities for enhanced communication between regulators and companies developing drugs to treat these infections. My program is in the middle of this evolution, which is both exciting and challenging."
Mary Beth joined six years ago after previously working in anti-infectives drug development for several pharmaceutical companies. She has an undergraduate pharmacy degree from the University of the Sciences, Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, and completed a clinical pharmacy residency at the Veteran's Administration Medical Center in Philadelphia. She completed her Ph.in pharmaceutics with an emphasis on pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.
Mary Beth is a team lead focused on 
 has become the most common cause of healthcare-associated infections in hospitals, and the includes 
 among the microorganisms with a "threat level of urgent." 
 infection [CDI] has increased in incidence and severity over the past decade, and is a growing worldwide health problem associated with substantial health care costs and significant morbidity and mortality.
Mary Beth has also been the clinical director responsible for overseeing the clinical activities including interacting with study sites and performing ongoing medical monitoring.
Clinical research is a long and challenging process. It can take years to complete trial enrollment followed by multiple years until product approval, but it is well worth the effort.
When joined Merck, someone told me that this is an 'academic company,' meaning people are very dedicated to quality work and want things to be absolutely perfect. like that. wouldn't enjoy working for a company that lacked a commitment to scientific excellence.
get to interact with people across the world and collaborate with innovative scientists from different disciplines. It's fun to work on complex problems with people who are deeply committed to the infectious diseases field.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
diagnosis of cancer is a life-changing event for both you and your loved ones. Coming to terms with a diagnosis is difficult enough without the additional strain of dealing with an oftentimes challenging and overwhelming health care system. While there have been significant advancements in cancer treatment, many cancer patients still do not receive the help they need.
To help lessen the burden of those affected by the disease, 
 is proud to work with the program partners of the 
 which aims to increase timely access to patient-centered care and reduce disparities in cancer care.
Georgia Cancer Center for Excellence at Grady Health System (Atlanta, GA)
Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center (Boston, MA)
The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (Baltimore, MD)
The University of Arizona Cancer Center (Tucson, AZ)
The University of Michigan School of Nursing serves as the Alliance National Program Office.
Together, the Alliance partners will work to...
Strengthen patient-centered care, including patient-provider communication, patient engagement, and patient-centered treatment planning.
Improve patient outcomes, including satisfaction with care and quality of life.
Build sustainable partnerships that advance patient-centered care and reduce disparities in access to high-quality cancer care.
 Through the Alliance, the Foundation aims to improve cancer care and outcomes for vulnerable and underserved populations affected by cancer in the With $15 million in funding from the Foundation over five years, the Alliance will support the implementation of multifaceted cancer care programs in selected communities across the country. Through an independent cross-site evaluation, the Foundation will also evaluate the impact of the Alliance and its programs, with a goal towards understanding and promoting best practices in cancer care.
With 1.7 million Americans newly diagnosed with cancer each year, there is a great need to improve the quality and delivery of patient-centered care to help address the significant challenges of those facing this diagnosis,” said Julie Gerberding, chief patient officer, and chief executive officer, Foundation. “These superb program sites and the National Program Office should accelerate identification and uptake of innovations that benefit patients, improve health communications, and enhance the overall coordination of care.
The Foundation is a U.S.-based, private charitable foundation. Established in 1957 by Merck, a leading global biopharmaceutical company, the Foundation is funded entirely by the company and is Merck's chief source of funding support to qualified non-profit charitable organizations. Since its inception, the Foundation has contributed more than $870 million to support important initiatives that address societal needs and are consistent with Merck's overall mission of inventing for life by bringing forward medicines and vaccines for many of the world's most challenging diseases.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
It's very important that you continue to do your monthly self-exams and get your mammograms because early detection is key.
Carolyn Ranzetta Matlack began her breast cancer journey in May 1996 when she was just 34-years-old. During her monthly self- exam, she felt a hard lump the size of a pea. Tests revealed that it was a cancerous tumor.
"My team – my motivation – was my family, friends and colleagues. They encouraged and supported me as navigated through the breast cancer landscape, which, for me, meant a lumpectomy on the right breast, six rounds of chemotherapy and radiation therapy every day for six weeks," Carolyn recalls.
In November 2005, breast cancer struck again. "was angry that cancer had crept into my life again, but was much better equipped to handle my second diagnosis," she notes. "had checked off the boxes: acceptance – check; control – check; live in the moment – check. was blessed once again with a strong support team."
Then in September of 2012, Carolyn began her third battle with breast cancer.
 women in the alone will develop breast cancer during her lifetime.
Today, there are more than 
 breast cancer survivors in the United States.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Over the past 125 years, we’ve seen the world change through the power of medicine and invention.
                            While each pivotal milestone has been unique, one thing they have in common is that we haven’t done it alone. At Merck, we have always believed that great medical breakthroughs rely on teamwork – from within and outside of – and our history has proven it. We are proud to have worked in partnership with companies, academics, governments, patient organizations, healthcare professionals, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), multilateral organizations and others in the private sector -- to help improve lives around the world and continue to solve some of the world’s most serious illnesses.
In the early 1940s, entered into an important partnership that would help treat those affected by one of the deadliest diseases in history: tuberculosis. In the early 1900s, tuberculosis, also known as the “The Great White” plague, killed one out of every seven people in the and Europe. In 1944, with support from chemists, Dr. Selman Waksman and his colleague Albert Schatz of Rutgers University reported the discovery of the first effective antibiotic against tuberculosis.
Waksman received support from chemists, use of the testing facilities at the Institute in Rahway, N.J., and assurance that pilot plant facilities would be available for producing substances. In exchange, received patent rights to any processes that Dr. Waksman developed. Dr. Waksman, later concerned that he had "turned over valuable public-health processes to a single organization for commercial exploitation," asked to abandon these valuable patent rights.
Given the many people suffering and dying from this disease, president George looked beyond issues of short-term profitability and turned over the patents to a Rutgers foundation, so this breakthrough antibiotic could be licensed to multiple manufacturers for production.
                                    To quickly respond to one of the most urgent health care needs of the time, constructed a streptomycin plant in Elkton, Va., and immediately began designing a large-scale production process for the antibiotic. became the first company to achieve large scale production of streptomycin in April 1946.
Dr. Selman Waksman (left), John Holcombe, plant manager (center), and Dr. Edward Nolan, branch plant supervisor (right), watching the construction of the new streptomycin building at the Elkton, Va., plant.
                                    As a result of Dr. Waksman’s collaboration with Merck, it only took three years to take the antibiotic from discovery to mass production – a major feat for the industry and the lives at stake. As Dr. Waksman remarked in his 1952 acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine:
With the removal of the danger lurking in infectious diseases and epidemics, society can face a better future, can prepare for a time when other diseases not now subject to therapy will be brought under control.
Today, remains committed to developing partnerships and ideas to help improve care and access to medicine around the world. Partnerships continue to fuel our quest to cure, including our efforts to develop new medications, helping to eradicate issues such as maternal mortality, and fighting diseases through a comprehensive approach of treatment, prevention, education and access. has a rich history of partnering, and we’re grateful to the many minds and organizations that have collaborated with us to discover and invent new ways, every day, to help the world be well.

Corporate Responsibility at Merck:
Finding New Ways to Create a Healthier and More Sustainable World
Operating responsibly is not only fundamental to Merck’s long-term success as a global biopharmaceutical company, it is also increasingly important to our stakeholders as expectations for how companies conduct themselves and contribute to society continue to rise.
How do we at define corporate responsibility?
For Merck, our approach to corporate responsibility is about the health, economic, social and environmental impact we have on individuals and communities around the world. We hold ourselves accountable to our many stakeholders, including patients, employees, customers and shareholders, whose perspectives help to define our corporate responsibility priorities
Each year, we set a high bar for our performance when it comes to increasing access to our medicines and vaccines, protecting the environment, promoting a positive, diverse and inclusive workplace for our employees, and conducting business in an ethical and transparent manner.
In addition to responding to the needs of stakeholders, our corporate responsibility efforts also support the 
United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals(SDGs)
, the international community’s aspirations for improving the lives of the world’s poorest people by 2030. We have joined global leaders to address the goals on health and well-being, clean water, climate change, diversity and inclusion, responsible consumption and production and others. Our support of the SDGs is a testament to our company’s 125+ year legacy of inventing for life to create a healthier world for all.
Below are a few highlights from our recently released corporate responsibility report that highlight our commitment to advance the social and economic conditions in the communities where we work and live:
We have expanded the 
 to reach up to 100 million more people per year through 2025 as part of the global effort to eliminate lymphatic filariasis.
, our 10-year, $500 million global initiative to end preventable maternal deaths, we have improved access to quality maternal healthcare and modern contraception for more than 6 million women around the world. 
In 2017, we achieved a 
31-percent increase of spend with diverse suppliers
, after a 57-percent increase in 2016, exceeding our corporate goal to achieve $1.2 billion in spend with minority-owned, women-owned, veteran-owned, LGBT-owned and disability-owned business enterprises.

World Sleep Day takes place on Friday, March 17, and is intended to be a celebration of sleep and a call to action on important issues related to sleep around the world.
                            Organized by the World Sleep Society, the theme of this year's 10th annual event is "Sleep Soundly, Nurture Life," which recognizes the importance of sleep for overall health.
                            Prior to World Sleep Day, most Americans will lose one hour of sleep as a result of Daylight Saving Time. Most people can handle the time change without difficulty, but for the millions of Americans struggling with insomnia, sleep is an ongoing issue.
Insomnia is typically characterized by trouble falling or staying asleep, and can affect people in a variety of ways.
Insomnia can be a frustrating, and even isolating condition, yet in the S., an estimated 
 experience symptoms consistent with the diagnosis of insomnia – roughly 
provides a number of resources to help patients struggling with sleep manage their condition. If you think you may be suffering from insomnia, be sure to check out these links and learn more about how to get the sleep you need.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Isaac Newton is often attributed as saying, “If have seen a little further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.” The decades-long contributions of many scientists enabled by increasingly powerful research tools have reached a tipping point and are yielding meaningful progress for cancer patients today. Notably, the convergence of immunology and oncology continues to generate considerable interest. As a hematologist/oncologist, it is heartening to see the advances made for cancer patients, especially for those where previously there was little hope.
At Merck, we are proud to play our part in this ongoing transformation and remain focused on the translation of breakthrough science into oncology therapeutics – to potentially bring new hope to patients. There are four basic elements to our approach, each of which is conducted with a collaborative mindset and utmost scientific rigor: 
Investment in exploratory research and discovery science to investigate critical questions, like the underlying genetics of cancer 
Discovery and development of novel mechanisms with a focus on candidates likely to have unambiguously large effect sizes
Testing the full potential of drug candidates and other novel approaches leveraging where appropriate precision medicine tools
Maximizing the application of monotherapies and realizing as well the clinical potential of cancer medicines through strategic evaluation of combination regimens
While important progress has been made and recent therapeutic advances across a number of novel pathways have changed the paradigm for many patients -- cancer remains a formidable foe. The key to transforming the treatment of cancer is to continuously pursue discovery and clinical research that will allow us to help as many patients as possible. 
With that in focus, is advancing a broad oncology development program that is exploring over 20 different novel mechanisms. This includes research designed to better understand how to deploy our medicines to the greatest effect and identifying those patients likely to benefit most. We know that cancer doesn’t have a single cause or progress along a single pathway, so we will likely need to attack it in multiple ways.
Advancing this goal requires drive and resilience to build and expand upon what has been achieved to date with a focus on improving the lives of patients. We have established a strong foundation and are excited to be leading the charge into the future.

We are committed to improving health literacy as part of our mission to improve human health.
Since 1891, has invented for life by pushing the boundaries of science with the hope and expectation that advancing scientific knowledge will lead to major advances in health.
believe one way to improve global healthcare is to make medical and health information as clear as possible for patients around the world. 
Arming patients with the knowledge and skills to make informed health decisions can help us reach our goal of improving public health. These skills are called 
—the ability to access, understand, appraise and apply health information. 
stronger predictor of a person’s health than age, income, employment status, education level and race.
Not the same as literacy—even people with advanced education and reading skills can face health literacy challenges. Only 12 percent of Americans have a proficient level of health literacy.  Every one of us can think of a time when we didn’t understand what a doctor said, maybe because we were sick or overwhelmed with emotion. 
Simple changes make a big difference.  Using plain language and clear formatting such as bullets and increased white space can shift the odds in favor of our patients.
As one of only two pharmaceutical companies that have a dedicated resource for health literacy, we are working hard to improve our patient communications.
We are working on a number of projects across divisions, around the world, including:
Improving our informed consent documents and diversity in clinical trials
Developing packaging that helps patients better understand how to take their medicines
Partnering with academia to develop and test health-literate patient labeling (we have had five health-literate patient labels approved, an important achievement for patients and, we believe, a model for the industry and the FDA) 
Sharing best practices with other pharmaceutical companies and regulatory authorities around the world
There is still a great deal of work to be done, but we have made tremendous progress already.
Simplifying information helps to increase the odds that people taking our medicines know how and when to take them, and that they are able to recognize and report potential side effects.  When patients are armed with this knowledge, we truly optimize the benefits of our medical innovation.
We are making great strides as a company and an industry to help a person’s ability to better understand, act on, and use health information.  Success depends on our employees’ passion for and support of health literacy.
Almost twenty years ago, chose to come to because of the company’s legacy of putting patients first.  This work builds upon that tradition, with health literacy champions in many parts of the world innovating every day

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Even the toughest person in the world goes through some low times. But you gotta create a game plan and stick to it.
 is a new awareness campaign focused on helping people with cancer and their loved ones tackle their emotional, nutritional and communication needs, and encourages people with head and neck cancer and their loved ones to make a “game plan” to support their cancer journey. With at the helm, the campaign is a collaboration between Pro Football Hall of Famer and head and neck cancer survivor Jim Kelly, Head Neck Cancer Alliance (HNCA) and Support for People with Oral and Head and Neck Cancer (SPOHNC), leading patient organizations supporting the head and neck cancer community for nearly six decades combined, and Savor Health, a service dedicated to supporting the nutritional needs of people living with cancer.
Many people living with head and neck cancer may experience different physical and emotional challenges than people with other forms of cancer. To help address these challenges, 
 provides support and resources, including Kelly’s tips on how to remain positive, and healthy recipes for those facing head and neck cancer.
Tools and resources include a guide to help people living with cancer talk to family and friends to get the support they need, strategies to help them cope emotionally with issues such as anxiety and depression, recipes to help enhance nutritional health, informational videos to help people stay positive throughout their cancer journey and much more.
							Pro Football Hall of Famer and cancer survivor Jim Kelly is teaming up with and leading cancer organizations to provide those living with head and neck cancer and their families much needed support and information to address some of the unique physical, emotional and nutrition challenges associated with the disease.
know first-hand the special challenges people living with head and neck cancer and their families face. My experience taught me so much about the importance of emotional support and taking care of myself, and hope that by sharing my experience, can inspire others to take action and know their game plan.
Jim’s personal experience being a head and neck cancer survivor
The struggles Jim Kelly faced on the football field as a former quarterback for the Buffalo Bills may be widely recognized, but many people may not know about his battle with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and what he learned along the way.
“am proud to share my personal experience as a head and neck cancer survivor, and encourage those facing head and neck cancer and their loved ones to visit 
 to find my ‘Kelly Tough’ tips. My hope is that you will find these tips – which helped me through my journey with cancer – and the other resources available through this campaign helpful.”
What to know about head and neck cancer
Head and neck cancer describes a number of different tumors that develop in or around the throat, larynx, nose, sinuses and mouth. Each year more than 60,000 new cases of head and neck cancer are diagnosed in the Many people with head and neck cancer face unique challenges as a result of surgeries and/or treatments that impact a person’s appearance, speech, smell, taste, ability to swallow and sight.
The head and neck cancer organizations that have partnered with on

 is really about three things. Number one, communication. Always let your doctors and the people around you know how you’re feeling. Number two, eat right. Make the right choices with food and exercise. Number three, and probably most important, it’s about having the right attitude. Stay positive.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
 chief diversity officer, In corporate life, so many buzzwords get thrown around so quickly that it's hard to keep track. There's "synergy" and "scalable," "best practice" and "leverage." The list is endless.
And although the phrase "diversity and inclusion" can be lost in the maze of corporate jargon, don't think diversity and inclusion is a buzzword at all. Rather, believe what diversity and inclusion stands for is essential to business success.
Here is how define them as they relate to our current workforce:
 Making sure your workplace employs individuals with different backgrounds and perspectives.
 Making sure all employees feel valued, respected and given access to the opportunities that help them grow in their careers and enable them to add value to our business. In many ways, it is about "bringing our whole selves to work." We want to make sure every employee feels valued; that they never have to hide who they are.
firmly believe that diversity and inclusion aren't simply "nice" virtues for a company to have or boxes for us to check — they create success both in our bottom line as well as in fostering a happy, healthy, and invested workforce.
see this in action every day. As the leader of Merck's Global Diversity and Inclusion organization, work with Merck's leaders across the globe to ensure that diversity and inclusion are woven into the fabric of our business to create a competitive advantage for our company. Being the nation's second largest pharmaceutical company (and the seventh largest worldwide), we know that having a diverse mindset is not just a nice aspiration — it's a necessity.
 Our current workforce and marketplace are more diverse and global than at any point in our company's lengthy history. The most racially and ethnically diverse generation ever has entered the workforce and is expected to make up half of the global workforce by 2020. This dynamic demands a very different here and abroad — one that understands and can help address the needs of an increasingly diverse base of patients, customers, employees and suppliers.
Nowhere is this more important externally than in our clinical trials. Clinical trials are critically important research studies that test how well new medical approaches work in people; they are at the heart of the process for bringing new medicines to patients. But a large percentage of clinical trials, regardless of the disease, are composed of white males.
The has noted that while African-Americans represent 12 percent of the total population, they make up only 5 percent of clinical trial participants. At Merck, we are inspired by a shared mission to save and improve lives. large part of what do is look for ways to help increase the minority participation in our trials. In a world of many ethnicities and cultures, it is important that these subjects reflect our population.
The goal set when came into this role several years ago remains the same: to make diversity and inclusion not just a part of our framework, but ingrained in our in how our managers hire, promote and develop their employees. We are making progress, but want to get us to the point where we shape what happens not only in the pharmaceutical industry – but in all companies.
Basically, my dream for is to get to the place where placing the weight of valuing global diversity and inclusion isn't on one person's shoulders, but in the minds and hearts of everyone.
think it’s a great dream to have.
The Action for Diversity Inclusion is the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion within the workplace. In June 2017, we joined more than 150 major companies in signing a pledge to reach diversity goals.
was also recently inducted into the Billion Dollar Roundtable, which recognizes and celebrates corporations who spend at least $1 billion with diverse suppliers.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
 is our company’s $500 million global initiative to create a world where no woman dies giving life. As part of our efforts, we’re focused on addressing the unmet need for family planning, 
which could save as many as 76,000 maternal lives every year
. That helps lift the global maternal mortality burden simply by delivering the services that women and girls want and need.
But for many women, particularly in emerging markets, the barriers to accessing — even seeking — quality family planning remain high. Consider Loise Kamua, a 22-year-old university student in Nairobi. When we met Loise last December, she told us how determined she was to finish her degree and pursue a career before she had children.
Unfortunately, family planning wasn’t something Loise felt she could talk about – not with friends, or her parents, or even her doctor. For many young people in Kenya, the topic is taboo. But then Loise discovered 
 is a digital service developed with support from 
. It provides information about family planning and can refer users to nearby clinics for services. To engage, all Loise had to do was text a number advertised on Facebook. “When saw it, was excited, because knew at least now can ask someone who won't judge me,” she said. 
We decided to partner with NIVI’s visionary creators and invest in its deployment because we saw its potential to empower women like Loise to make informed choices and take control of their reproductive health. We invested in because it represents the power of digital technology to transform healthcare in emerging markets, by bridging critical gaps in information, equity and quality. 
With NIVI, we’re leveraging basic mobile phone and texting capabilities – no data plan, computer or high-speed Internet connection required – to address the high unmet need for family planning in countries like Kenya, and in doing so, support 
 mission to improve maternal health outcomes and reduce maternal mortality. 
The insights we gain from tracking the use of these tools and technologies allows us to deepen our understanding of the challenges mothers and their caregivers face, and leverage that knowledge to refine these systems and platforms, increase their value and maximize their impact. 
One of NIVI’s most exciting and innovative features is the Chatbot, which supports two-way conversations and can address common questions about maternal and reproductive health. Its back-end capabilities allow us to gather real-time data around family planning – key information for governments, policymakers and other stakeholders. This information, obtained in real-time, is also being leveraged to make even more responsive to the needs of its customers.
Moreover, the Chatbot’s ability to manage fairly complex, nuanced interactions via simple two-way texting offers new possibilities for meaningful engagement with patients and consumers. 
, we remain committed to exploring digital approaches that put the needs of patients – and women like Loise – at the center. And we look forward to sharing what we learn along the way.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
is testing the use of drones to deliver medicines during times of crisis.
When disaster strikes and infrastructure collapses, people can die when their medications can’t reach them. Since electricity and roads can take significant time to be restored, how do disaster-relief teams get medication to those who need it most? 
is partnering with small and large organizations, both public and private, to see if drone delivery of medications during crises could be an option of the future. 
How envisions the drone testing to play out in the real world
The first drone flight to deliver medicines in a test environment took place in Lugano, Switzerland in April 2017. It proved the drone delivery method may not be such a far-fetched idea after all. The second,  in Puerto Rico during August 2018, helped the project team refine the technology.
Many partner organizations are involved, including the Federal Aviation Administration, Department of Homeland Security, and Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
Meanwhile, employees from many areas of our company — supply chain, manufacturing, corporate responsibility, IT, aviation and security  —  are lending their expertise to help test this potential method of medicine delivery.
Pablo Maestre, security lead for in Puerto Rico, helped with the most recent testing following the devastation caused by Hurricane Maria in August 2018. It’s a project that is very close to his heart. 
Pablo lost his uncle, Ivan Maestre — who lived on the western edge of the island — three months after Hurricane Maria struck the island; the Category 4 storm was the island's most severe natural disaster in modern history. 
 “My uncle Ivan was a severe diabetes patient — he needed injections three times a day. He was without insulin for more than a month. Even was not aware,” Pablo recounts. “When he finally received insulin, he was in bad condition. Several weeks later, his health declined, he had renal failure, and he died.” 
The drone team recently acknowledged Pablo’s contributions, and his personal loss, by giving the project a new nickname. Once called “Major Tom” after the David Bowie song, it’s now “Project Ivan.” 
Direct Relief, a California-based non-governmental organization that is one of Merck’s humanitarian relief partners, is coordinating the work. They are testing how such systems can be deployed in an emergency and securing the participation of health centers in Puerto Rico.
conceived of the project and is funding the tests and donating medications for delivery, using its Las Piedras facility in Puerto Rico as the departure point.
Softbox, from England, makes the small temperature-controlled packaging system for transporting cold chain medications - those requiring constant refrigeration.
AT&T’s Internet of Things (IoT) technology is being used to monitor the temperature and location of Softbox’s cold chain boxes.
Volans-i is providing the long-range delivery drones and is controlling the flights.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
From the Marines to Merck:
When decided to pursue a career in the military, wasn’t sure whether it would be for 5 years or 20 years. was passionate about serving our country and drawn to the Marine Corps’ camaraderie and values of “Honor, Courage, and Commitment”. I’ll be forever grateful for the experiences the Marine provided me and, most importantly, the Marines with whom served.
Ultimately, decided to leave the military for business school and a new mission.  believe that the private sector’s resources can and should be used to help solve our world’s most pressing challenges.
It was in my business school ethics class that first learned about Merck.
The topic? Merck’s role in developing a treatment for 
 despite no financial incentives to do so. was impressed with the decision leadership made at that time, and its continued commitment today. And, was inspired by the company’s commitment to put patients first.
After meeting with Merck’s veteran recruiter who helped me understand how my military service could benefit the company, was lucky enough to begin my career here through the Finance Rotational Program. I’m now associate director in Corporate Strategy, where work on our corporate crisis management program while also exploring new ways to use data science and digital technology to help improve how we treat patients.
In my time here, I’ve learned more about Merck’s mission of saving and improving lives and witness daily the passion to succeed in that mission. Every employee aims to conduct themselves with pride, respect and a greater sense of purpose – objectives that align with my military background.
believe our passion is fueled by our commitment to patients.
Patients are the heart in all that we do. We hear patients’ stories. We listen to patient organizations, communities and caregivers about what matters to them. This helps us shape clinical trials and identify unmet medical needs to guide our R&efforts. And, it helps to reinforce the company’s commitment to corporate responsibility and enables us to establish programs to tackle some of humanity’s greatest challenges.
It’s easy to see that the work we do matters, and that’s really important for me.
While the transition from the military to the business world has been challenging at times, joining a team with a focused, positive mission and the support of dedicated colleagues has been very familiar.
have yet to come across a leader at who isn’t passionate about our mission of saving and improving lives and the impact we can have on patients. While the challenge of striking the balance of doing well while doing good will never be easy, it may be the only mission worth pursuing.
Veterans at We foster a culture of inclusion and belonging where all employees feel welcomed and valued─a culture where we regard every individual as a source of competitive advantage in our larger mission of saving and improving lives.
Veterans have a lot to offer our company. The work ethic, leadership skills, and dedication that we all gain from our time in uniform can be leveraged in different ways across the organization.
At we support veterans through our Global Veterans Employee Business Resource Group (EBRG), a community that provides leadership development and networking forums for its members. We also support active duty service members and veterans in our communities.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
                            When a new strain of canine influenza emerged last year, Animal Health hit the ground running to help protect dogs.
In March 2015, veterinarians in Chicago began reporting an alarming number of dogs showing signs of an infectious respiratory disease, with symptoms ranging from coughing, lethargy, to fever. Some dogs even developed pneumonia. What was initially thought to be a strain of “kennel cough” (aka: Infectious Canine Tracheobronchitis) was eventually identified as something more severe: The canine influenza virus (CIV), a highly contagious and serious disease.
“Early on, we suspected veterinarians were dealing with an outbreak of canine influenza and not kennel cough, which spurred us to implement the collection of nasal and pharyngeal samples from sick dogs that were tested by Cornell University,” said Kathleen Heaney, D.V.M., executive director, Companion Animal Technical Services, Animal Health.
We came to realize what was actually unfolding was the transmission of an influenza strain – H3N2 – never before seen in the United States.
Based on the highly contagious nature of the strain, the severity of it, as well as the rate at which they were seeing newly diagnosed cases, Animal Health knew they needed to act fast —both to help veterinarians and pet owners contain the outbreaks and develop a vaccine to protect dogs against it.
Dog flu is passed through direct and indirect contact with an infected dog. What makes H3N2 even more of a problem is that an infected dog can be infectious for up to 24 days. Social dogs that visit dog parks, doggie day care, kennels and groomers are at most risk.
Animal Health quickly set up webinars for veterinarians, utilizing experts in the field of virology and immunology. The multiple webinars reached more than 5,000 veterinary professionals across the and gave them tools they could use to help address Animal Health also initiated an educational email campaign to more than 26,000 veterinarians to create awareness among veterinarians in states that had not yet been affected.
“In the face of an outbreak, it is critical to be transparent and share accurate and up-to-date information with all involved,” says Chicago-based Animal Health veterinarian Joseph Hahn, who worked to help curb the outbreak.
The Animal Health team helped veterinarians prepare for interviews with the media about canine influenza. The team developed educational materials for veterinarians to share with their clients about keeping dogs healthy. Additionally, the team provided pet owners with tips on how to stop the spread of the virus through multiple communication channels.
Eight months after identification of the new strain, Animal Health received approval for a conditional license for its H3N2 vaccine. Animal Health began shipping the vaccine the day after approval.
Since the first outbreak in 2015, 30 states have reported cases of H3N2 canine influenza. Animal Health’s awareness-raising efforts have generated hundreds of reports on social media channels and news outlets, such as Bloomberg, Huffington Post, Pet World and others.
This year, Animal Health launched a multi-city tour of pop-up events to help educate dog owners about canine influenza. Called If This Dog Could Talk, the events included information sessions with local veterinarians as well as photographer Elias Weiss Friedman from The Dogist who was on hand to photograph attendees' furry friends.

How Will You Invent the Future?
My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
In September 2015, the 193 Member States of the United Nations came together to create a plan for achieving a better future for all. Their goal is an ambitious one — they want to help end extreme poverty, fight inequality and injustice, and protect our planet. This proposal is called “Agenda 2030” and is comprised of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which clearly define how to help create a better world. Fulfilling these SDGs will take an unprecedented effort, and for business they represent an opportunity to benefit society while growing and sustaining our business.
At Merck, we have set a 10-year strategy to determine critical business enablers related to climate and the environment.
As the vice president of Global Safety and the Environment here at Merck, I'm focused on guiding on four SDGs: Clean Water Sanitation; Affordable Clean Energy; Responsible Consumption Production, and, the focus of this perspective, 
Climate Action: Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts.
In the future, customers will require us to identify new approaches from a climate action perspective, in some cases to help them meet their own sustainability goals. In that context, many eyes are watching our water use, waste reduction, and resource consumption.
We have the resources and ability to be a global leader on climate action, and we’re using science and technology to:
Increase the reuse of materials and develop innovative single-use technology to reduce the amount of waste we send to landfills.
Engage with advocacy groups, ratings organizations, suppliers and investors to report against our environmental sustainability goals.
Engage our employees through Energy Treasure Hunts, where small teams can find ways to improve our energy efficiency.
Our efforts have not gone unnoticed. To cite one example, 
has earned recognition from the Environmental Protection Agency Energy Star Program for 13 consecutive years
 because of our long-term performance and our commitment to improvement.
We’re measured not just by the medicines we make, but also by how much good we do in the world.
By committing to taking action on climate change, we can grow our business and ensure our continued position as a global leader.
healthy planet is essential to human health and the sustainability of our business. 
We have established a new set of environmental sustainability goals that help position our company to succeed in an increasingly resource-constrained world. 
 about how our company is taking action in support of the SDGs.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
National Immunization Awareness Month (NIAM) is an annual observance held in August to highlight the importance of vaccination for people of all ages.
to raise awareness about the important role vaccines play in preventing diseases across a lifetime.
Vaccines are one of the greatest public health success stories of the last two centuries,
eradicating smallpox and nearly eliminating other diseases like polio worldwide.
 vaccines help prevent at least 30 infectious diseases, according to World Health Organization
 it is estimated that vaccination programs have helped prevent millions of cases of contagious diseases
Annual wellness visits or back-to-school checkups are the perfect time to make sure your family is

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
By Sandra Milligan, senior vice president of Global Regulatory Affairs and Clinical Safety
As the senior vice president of Global Regulatory Affairs and Clinical Safety (GRACS), oversee a large and diverse group related to getting and keeping Merck's products on the market. Our end goal is a lofty yet achievable one – to ensure our innovative medicines reach patients safely and quickly.
But there is another aspect to my life at take equally as seriously – I'm the executive sponsor of the Veteran's Employee Business Resource Group (usually shortened to EBRG). EBRGs are voluntary, employee-led groups that foster a diverse, inclusive workplace aligned with our mission, values, goals, business practices, and objectives. 
Merck's Veteran's is open to all employees and raises awareness of veteran’s issues and honors veterans and active military throughout the year through events, activities and outreach.  The group sends letters and packages to those currently serving, veterans and those in hospitals.  They support employees who are deployed and help guide and mentor transitioning service members. 
Supporting vets is both a professional and personal duty for me as I, too, am a veteran. joined the Army Medical during medical school and after graduation, did my internship training at Letterman Army Medical Center during the first Iraq war (Operations Desert Shield and Storm).  During the Somalia engagement (Operation Restore Hope), led the adult outpatient clinic at Fort Myer, Va. through the end of my military commitment.  was privileged to treat active duty soldiers and their families dealing with the consequences of these overseas military engagements.
The military is the most diverse organization I’ve ever worked for.  It attracts, cultivates and develops talent from every walk of life. Every soldier was invaluable to the success of the mission no matter what rank or role. Courageous leadership was demonstrated every day in unexpected ways and places. The discipline, experience and focus of these men and women are remarkable assets for any sector, whether private or public.
Bringing veterans into our company is an opportunity to leverage and benefit from diverse perspectives, experiences and leadership capabilities, enriching our organization at every level. 
Supporting the Veteran's has allowed me to connect with veterans from a wide range of roles and geographies.  I’ve met veterans who have served our country during times of conflict, and I’ve met staff whose family and friends include those who have served. 
Through the leadership of Amy Thurston and the Veteran's EBRG, is acknowledged and recognized as a leader in employing and supporting veterans.  
Here are just some of accolades has received for its support of veterans:
We've been a Best for Vets for the past four consecutive years by Military Times; in 2018 we were ranked 13th out of 100 companies.
Jobs selected us as a Most Military Friendly Employer for the past eight consecutive years (usually one of the only pharmaceutical firms to be acknowledged). earned the first ever Most Military Friendly for Spouses Award in 2018.
Veterans Magazine recognized us as a Best for Vets employer for three of the past four years earning the Best for Vets Index Award in 2018.
was recently inducted into the Billion Dollar Roundtable, which recognizes and celebrates corporations who spend at least $1 billion with diverse suppliers. 
We've had great success in elevating and supporting veterans at Merck, but the future looks even brighter — the number of vets at is growing daily. It's a great honor to help support these exceptional employees (both past and present) while we all contribute to Merck's shared mission of serving patients and individuals every day, in every role.

The singer and songwriter on helping women feel better prepared for whatever lies ahead
 collaboration between and award-nominated singer-songwriter and actress, Mandy Moore, is encouraging women to plan ahead and get educated about family planning, including birth control options, so they can feel better prepared for whatever lies ahead.
Moore's life and career has been filled with adventures, and she knows first-hand the role setting goals and planning ahead can have in making informed decisions.

The Role of Family Planning
The survey also identified that for many, their current priorities did not include starting or growing a family (40% among those without children and 39% among those with children, respectively). Among the 908 birth control users surveyed, nearly one in four women considered their options for less than 15 minutes before making a decision.

                          Guinness World Records announces a new world record for the most medicines – including – donated in a 24-hour period.
Twenty-four hours. More than 207 million doses donated. The result? new world record – not to mention the positive impact on the health of millions of people worldwide. 
 In April, Guinness World Records awarded a certificate to a coalition of global health and development organizations -- 
 (NTDs) -- for the most medicine donated in 24 hours. Uniting to Combat NTDs is a collective of invested, interested and dedicated partners who work together to fulfill the 
. The recognition took place during this year’s World Health Organization-hosted Summit in Geneva, Switzerland. The World Record was awarded to Uniting to Combat NTDs and is shared by all pharmaceutical signatories of the London Declaration, along with other partners.
It all started back in 2012, when Uniting to Combat NTDs endorsed the London Declaration on Neglected Tropical Diseases. The London Declaration aimed to support the World Health Organization’s goal of controlling, eliminating and eradicating 10 specific diseases by 2020.
Fast forward five years, to January 2017.
In recognition of the fifth anniversary of the London Declaration, Uniting to Combat NTDs decided to put legs to its mission. They set an ambitious goal: organizing the documentation of a one-day mass donation of medicines, the scale of which had not been seen before.
As Bill Gates noted in a 
, “a lot can happen in 24 hours.”
On January 30, Uniting to Combat NTDs “organized drug manufacturers, warehouse workers, delivery drivers, government officials, and health workers to deliver this historic number of donated drugs on four continents for distribution to people living in the remotest parts of the world,” Mr. Gates wrote.
In all, members donated more than 207 million medication doses to treat NTDs in 24 hours. Merck's donation of 4 million doses of 
 contributed to the record figure.
In addition to Merck, several organizations and companies helped to make the donation possible, including Bayer, Eisai, Gilead, GSK, Johnson Johnson, KGaA, Novartis, Pfizer and Sanofi.
Donation Program: 30 years in the fight to eliminate river blindness and lymphatic filariasis
Continuing our commitment to addressing neglected tropical diseases, recently announced a $300,000 cash donation to support non-governmental organization (NGO) partners working to eliminate river blindness (onchocerciasis) and lymphatic filariasis (LF) in Africa. The donation will be offered to 10 NGOs beginning this year, and will be administered through the Donation Program (MDP). "Since the Donation Program began 30 years ago, and its global partners have made great strides to control and eliminate river blindness and lymphatic filariasis,” says Brenda Colatrella, executive director, Corporate Responsibility. “With both diseases now targeted for elimination, we hope this grant will enable our partner NGOs to achieve further progress toward that goal.”
 (MDP) and its partners currently reach more than 200 million people in more than 30 countries each year. Initially focused on river blindness, in 1998, expanded the to include oversight of the donation of and GSK’s albendazole for the prevention of in African countries where the disease coexists with river blindness.
Since the program started in 1987, has donated more than 2.5 billion treatments for river blindness and LF.
The program has been a catalyst in the formation of similar donation programs for other NTDs. The broad public-private partnership also supports the training of community health care workers and strengthening distribution systems through which other medicines, vaccines and medical supplies can be delivered in resource-poor settings.

When was asked to take on the leadership role of for the GD&Center of Excellence, knew immediately that diversity and inclusion (D&I) was a powerful business strategy capable of making significant impact on our mission of saving and improving lives. understood and appreciated the undeniable business case for diversity and inclusion and the benefits companies realize when diverse perspectives are intentionally engaged. And knew, without question, that the rapidly changing global workforce, rise of technology and digitization and incidence of certain chronic illnesses among diverse populations coupled with the competitive nature of our industry made it absolutely critical that we attract and retain the best and brightest diverse minds - bar none - to solve and innovate for the most pressing business problems. was confident that we could truly win for our patients with diversity and inclusion as a business priority. 
As a team, we at have 
deepened our commitment to integrate diversity and inclusion throughout all aspects of our business
 to drive true competitive advantage. We use holistic best practices and implement our strategy to focus on establishing a strong foundation for D&I, fostering internal workforce and workplace excellence, driving external reputation, and achieving innovation through business integration. 
Our focus on diversity and inclusion is proving powerful results on business performance.
Our current workforce is more diverse and global than at any point in our company's lengthy history. We want to mirror the market we serve and leverage the unique insights of our people to drive business results. 
We pledged to advance D&in the workplace through the Action for Diversity Inclusion, the largest CEO-driven business commitment to D&within the workplace.
In 2017 we were inducted into the Billion Dollar Roundtable, which recognizes and celebrates corporations who spend at least $1 billion with diverse suppliers.
Reducing health care disparities are business priorities and as a result we strive to achieve diversity in clinical trials.
Every year we host 
 – a month-long gathering and celebration of the D&work of colleagues around the world which highlights the impact diversity and inclusion has on our employees and where we live and work.
We continue to invest in learning efforts to help all employees increase their awareness of unconscious biases and provide tools to help mitigate their impact on decision-making. 
We are pleased to share that we support 
 — a call to action and model for gender equality.  This movement of CEOs, business executives, board members and business academics are committed to achieving a new norm in corporate leadership:  one in which women and men have equal power, status and opportunity.  By signing on, we pledged to continue working with our colleagues and others across the globe, to establish parity in our own businesses.  We pledged support because we believe these D&goals are important…and attainable.
While there is still more work to be done, we are proud of what we have accomplished and energized about the future.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Adam Schechter, president, Global Human Health, 2010 – 2018, shared his insights on our Pricing Transparency Report. Here are his thoughts from 2017, based on the Report’s 2016 findings.
At – and many other drug companies – we talk about innovation, about how much we invest in research, about how our medicines and vaccines help patients. Help families. Help economies. Because that is, at the most foundational level, who we are, what we do, and why we come to work each day. Our mission has been to discover, develop and provide innovative medicines and vaccines that save and improve lives around the world, and we have not wavered from that mission for over 125 years.
Recently, there has been a lot of talk about price in the And we understand why. The price conversation over the past year has been driven and dominated by the justified public outrage in response to companies that hiked prices by triple digits, or had a business model based primarily on price increases. That is not true of – and, to give credit to others, that is not true for many other innovative, R&D-based drug companies either.
has increased prices, and in our view, we have been responsible in our approach. But we want to allow the public to judge for themselves by providing information for people to better understand our pricing practices – including the rebates and discounts that we provide to payers (insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, the government).
We decided to provide information publicly – specifically, how much increased list prices across our portfolio each year, and how much net prices increased across our portfolio once you take discounts, rebates and returns into account. We also decided to share Merck’s “discount” rate in the – the average discount on Merck’s sales of its medicines and vaccines in the Today, we are sharing that information on the 
 of our Corporate Responsibility Report – and not just about last year, but also for every year since 2010. We will update this information in January every year.
We’ve taken a close look at our pricing practices – and we believe we have a good track record. Since 2010, Merck’s average net price increase across our portfolio each year has been in the low to mid-single digits: specifically, 3.4 percent to 6.2 percent.
Our average discount rate has been steadily increasing, as we provide more discounts and rebates. In 2016, Merck’s discount rate was 40.9 percent.
Over the same time period for which we are disclosing our pricing data, 2010 to 2016, spent more than $50 billion on R&D.
These are just a few aspects of what we do. Because of our unwavering commitment to both invent new medicines and vaccines, and make those medicines and vaccines affordable and accessible, we surprised a lot of people in January last year by introducing our hepatitis medicine at a much lower list price than the standard of care at the time. We took this action because we believed that doing so would help enable more patients to be treated more quickly.
There are other examples of how we’re responding to concerns about affordability. We are incorporating biomarkers into our clinical studies. These biomarkers help identify the right medicine for the right patient, which is good for patients, and for payers. We also are exploring alternative pricing and contracting arrangements by entering into value based contracts with payers. It’s just the right thing to do to ensure health care dollars are spent wisely – by insurers, governments, and patients.
And because patients share in the cost of their care in the – more for pharmaceuticals than other aspects of health care – we have programs to help those who cannot afford their medications. We offer 
For uninsured patients, we have been an industry leader with our now 55-year old 
. In 2009, we expanded our entry criteria so that patients in the may be eligible for the program if their household income is at or below 400 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL). higher threshold of 500 percent of the applies to some of our specialty products, where patients usually have higher co-pays. Because in the end, we don’t invent for the sake of inventing – we invent because we want patients to be able to benefit from our inventions.
We don’t expect this new information to change the conversation from price to innovation. But we hope it will help. We know that we can do more to reach more patients with the medicines we have today. We’re focused on that – and on ensuring that can continue to invest in R&to fight the diseases we all worry about – such as Alzheimer’s, cancer, and infectious diseases. Great progress has been made, but more needs to be done, and we want to be a part of the solution.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
has not only provided more than $22 million in financial and product contributions to those impacted by those recent hurricanes, earthquakes and wildfires
, but its employees have volunteered many hours to help get their communities back on their feet.
Locating missing colleagues and providing much-needed supplies and support
Isabel Torres, a customer sales manager with Merck, was among the 3.4 million people affected by Hurricanes Maria and Irma. The family endured days without power and a rapidly dwindling supply of water and food.
“My husband and have teenagers, one of whom is disabled. We live on a remote side of the island. There were no lights anywhere. Debris was everywhere. And no way to communicate with anybody.” 
Little did she know that three of her colleagues were determined to find her: Edward Cordero and Frank Castillo from Merck's Manufacturing Division (MMD); and Pablo Maestre, who works in global security. 
“We had several employees unaccounted for,” says Frank. “We got a truck and a police escort to travel with us and spent about 13 hours searching for everybody.”
Finding Isabel proved to be their biggest challenge. Houses were dark and roads were impassable. “We set out on foot and came across a group of people outside who showed us how to get to Isabel’s house. She was surprised when we showed up. There were lots of tears,” says Frank. Supplies from Merck, such as food and water, soon followed for Isabel's family.
Back in operation in just 14 days 
Once all employees were located, one of the next jobs was to restore manufacturing operations. “Our people stepped up to the challenge without hesitation,” says Joel Alvarado, a engineer.  “We did clean-up work, repairs and inspections and resumed manufacturing of key products in just 14 days.”
Joel says countless stories unfolded of “camaraderie, support and empathy. We shared water, food, supplies and experiences as a family.”
When employee Chris Savage saw the devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey, he reached out to colleagues to organize a relief team. 
Volunteers from the company’s Upper Gwynedd, Pennsylvania, site and a field sales colleague from Oregon responded immediately to the call for help in Texas. They partnered with Samaritan’s Purse and spent 124 hours repairing storm-damaged homes and removing trees and debris in Rockport, Texas. They also spent 20 hours at a wildlife refuge, cleaning up after the storm. 
Before the seven volunteers traveled to Texas, Health Services provided vaccines and information about risks involved in this type of effort, and team members from our West Point, Pennsylvania, site provided safety packages for the crew, including protective eyewear, hardhats and gloves. 
“Our family really pulled together to support us on our trip,” says Chris. “The effort is an example of how employees have the capacity to change the world – in this case, one storm-damaged home at a time."
More than 20 colleagues from our Houston sales team worked with the Houston Food Bank to prepare 1,500 lunches, sort and package food, and load supplies on trucks headed for areas in need.
“It was an incredibly rewarding volunteer experience to see our colleagues from across our franchises work together to strengthen a community that means so much to all of us,” says employee Erik Moore.
The unbreakable human-animal bond
“This was one of the most amazing, gratifying and emotional experiences I’ve ever had.” These words sum up the 10-day volunteer experience at two animal shelters in the Houston area of Jay Tischendorf, a veterinarian for Animal Health. Many of the animal health products used at the shelters were donated by Animal Health.
“It was heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time,” says Jay. “The animals were arriving by the truckload. Some were strays. Others had been separated from their human families. Animals are a huge part of our lives. Next to gravity, the human-animal bond may be the most powerful force on earth.”
From her Arizona home, Debera Butler could not stop watching the news. “cried when saw people in Texas take their dogs into the helicopters or boats. just knew had to do something to help.” 
Debera, another veterinarian for Animal Health, applied for an emergency veterinary license in Texas. Soon, she was on her way to the George Brown Convention Center in Houston, the only facility that allowed individuals to keep their pets with them.
For four days, Debera provided vaccines and medicine for animals and “lots of hugs for the humans.” 
When Denise Rebeor, an associate sales director for the west coast of Florida, learned about an urgent situation in a Florida community, she swung into action to help families impacted by Hurricane Irma. Little did she know, a big surprise was around the corner. 
Denise and her 14-year-old daughter set aside their own concerns about power loss and storm damage at their Fort Myers home to help families in Bonita Springs, Florida. While there, Denise met the pastor of a local church, who helped her team up with other volunteers to package and deliver food, water, sheets diapers and other needed supplies to some of the poorest areas in the community.  
“At one point, the pastor lifted his sunglasses and said, ‘know you.’ Turns out it was Charles Roth, a former employee who worked in sales training with me 18 years ago,” says Denise. “cannot believe our paths crossed.”
Denise and her daughter spent a week in the area and will never forget the experience.
“We came upon a young woman who was very pregnant living in a shed because her house had been overturned. There were so many people in need and so many who showed up to help. The human spirit is fragile but resilient and compassionate.”

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
As a psycho-oncology counselor, Arlene Houldin knows first-hand just how devastating a diagnosis of melanoma can be. “Stress, fear, and anxiety are perfectly normal,” she notes. But as the patient advocates in this video can attest, there are options and there are resources. diagnosis of melanoma doesn’t mean you have to face it alone.
In honor of May being Melanoma/Skin Cancer Detection and Prevention Month, we want to celebrate the patient advocates and organizations who share, inspire, and empower others on this journey.
Melanoma patient advocacy organizations offer people living with melanoma access to a full spectrum of services and information.
They provide patients and their loved ones with resources that offer emotional and/or financial assistance; information on treatment options, products in development and clinical trials; and information on prevention and early detection, among other topics.
The Melanoma International Foundation (MIF) is one such organization. Founded by Catherine Poole after her diagnosis of melanoma, aims to help those living with the disease, as well as their support networks.
Patients really need to hear from other melanoma patients and their experiences, and what helped them cope and find the best direction for their treatment.
Although Jamie Goldfarb grieved after her diagnosis and subsequent treatment, she found strength through the love and support of others. She now pays it forward as a patient advocate.
The love that you experience, that you feel and that is given to you is — it’s like nothing anywhere else. think what has surprised me along the way is how much beauty is in this journey.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
After my lung cancer diagnosis, was sad and angry. But came to realize that survived to make a difference in the lives of others fighting this disease.
Although more people die of lung cancer each year than colon, breast and prostate cancers combined, there’s still a widely held belief that it is a self-inflicted disease.
The guilt and blame associated with lung cancer may prevent people from talking about their illness and even visiting their doctors for treatment. And because there have only been incremental gains in the survival rate for the past 40 years, unfortunately there isn't an army of survivors who can become the public face of the disease.
This places survivors in a unique position to right misperceptions about lung cancer being a “smoker’s disease” and to advocate for others impacted by the number one cancer killer worldwide. Today, four survivors are lending their voices to 
, an awareness campaign focused on helping people with cancer and their loved ones tackle the emotional well-being, health/nutrition and communication challenges along their journey.
Graduate student and patient advocate Taylor Bell Duck knows that anyone with lungs can get lung cancer. star soccer player who never smoked, Duck’s lung cancer diagnosis at age 21 came as a shock to her and her family. 
In 2005, Duck arrived at college expecting to play for the Division 1 team, but her health started to become an issue. She experienced painful numbness in her feet and recurring pneumonia that forced her to quit the sport she loved. During her junior year, a stomach pain resulted in a trip to the ER, where she learned that her left lung was completely collapsed and had a large mass. After undergoing surgery to remove part of her lung, Duck has shown no evidence of disease for the past nine years.
Now cancer-free, Duck brings inspiration and hope to others though her work with advocacy groups and most recently

We believe in the work we do and are working with the entire cancer community to help people with cancer and their caregivers better navigate their journeys.
Ultimately, our work in changing the outcomes of cancer would not be possible without: …the participation of patients in clinical trials
…the support and involvement of the physicians who believe in the importance of advancing the care for patients through innovative clinical trials
We’re pushing the boundaries of science with the hope and 
 expectation that the medicines and vaccines we invent will lead to
 better health for society for generations to come.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
 At Merck, we believe having a diverse workforce — comprised of people from different races, genders, ethnicities, cultures, ages, disabilities, religions, gender identities, gender expressions, and veteran status — is fundamental to our company’s success.
Our dedication to diversity and inclusion creates a competitive advantage for our people and for our customers, and is accomplished in partnership with Merck’s Global Diversity and Inclusion (GD&I) Center of Excellence (CoE). The Cois a specialized team within Human Resources that strives to create a workplace where diversity and inclusion exist as a natural part of our day-to-day operations and decisions.
September is Merck’s third annual GD&Experience month. Throughout the month, we’ll be celebrating different aspects of Diversity and Inclusion and highlighting the employees and leaders who make our company so unique. They include:
virtual reality experience that allows participants to put themselves in someone else’s shoes to experience and feel bias firsthand. 
talk by a veteran and Paralympic snowboarding champion, Kirstie Ennis.  helicopter gunner, Ennis lost her leg in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan in 2012.  She’s overcome enormous challenges and obstacles like climbing Mount Kilimanjaro.
An interactive session on Navigating Conflict and Tricky Conversations, where attendees will learn how to manage productive vs. nonproductive conflict; effective strategies to giving/receiving feedback; and understanding how to build a culture of trust by navigating ‘tricky’ conversations. 
An Employee Business Resource Group summit where attendees will build business knowledge and skills while enhancing leadership capabilities as they commit to lead inclusively.
The Interfaith Organization will sponsor a meal-packing event in Upper Gwynedd for the international hunger relief organization, 
, which distributes food and life-changing aid to the world’s most vulnerable.
We are deeply committed to fostering an inclusive environment that embraces different perspectives and values the contributions of each individual. Having a globally and locally diverse workforce makes us a more innovative and agile company—and one better attuned to the needs of our customers, health care providers and patients who ultimately use our products.
Merck’s Employee Business Resource Groups (EBRGs)
At Merck, we've taken a pioneering and global approach to our diversity strategy through the creation of Employee Business Resource Groups (EBRGs). These groups represent the diverse constituencies in our company, our customers and society, in general. The members represent different geographies, cultures and areas of expertise. Together they reflect employees and customers globally. They are:

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Our suppliers should reflect the people we are in business to serve... our customers.
At Merck, we believe that having a diverse supplier base helps us better understand and anticipate the needs of the people we serve.  That is why we cast a wide net in search of talent, seeking qualified suppliers from all segments of the global community.  Our supplier diversity program includes Minority-, Women-, Veteran-, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender- and Disability-owned business enterprises as well as small businesses.
Interested in becoming a supplier? Here's what we'll expect from you:
We hold our suppliers to the same standards to which we hold our own employees.  We expect our suppliers to: 
provide top-quality  products and services along with the highest level of service;  
demonstrate that they are proactive, innovative and able to think strategically; and
We seek to create sustainable, mutually beneficial relationships with diverse suppliers. To do this, we establish annual procurement goals for goods and services from Minority-, Women-, Veteran-, Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT)- and Disability-owned businesses.
In addition to setting specific targets, we have implemented other tools and programs to help us build a world-class program and work to ensure the growth, sustainability and increased competitiveness of our diverse suppliers.  These include sustainability planning, mentoring, a robust second-tier program, and scholarships and other external educational opportunities for suppliers.
It is policy to provide maximum practical opportunity to diverse suppliers to provide goods and services to the company as a part of our corporate procurement process.  The use of diverse suppliers is an integral part of our purchasing procedures, just as equal opportunity employment is central to our personnel policies and procedures.  We recognize that supplier diversity creates a competitive advantage for our company and positively impacts the global community.  We believe that the success of the company and society depends on enabling diverse businesses to share and grow in the global market.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
We innovate through the diversity of our teams and the power of inclusion.
Our Global Diversity and Inclusion Center of Excellence oversees diversity and inclusion in all of our business practices. 
We have more than 10,000 global members of Employee Business Resource Groups (EBRGs) who help to drive employee engagement and achieve powerful business results.
EBRGs are employee volunteer groups of diverse constituencies that support talent acquisition, share business insights, and enhance the company’s reputation as employer of choice. They provide leadership development, networking forums and mentoring opportunities for employees.

Expanding Patient Access to Merck's Investigational Medicines
When results from clinical trials suggest that one of our investigational medicines may offer benefits for patients facing life-threatening conditions, is committed to bringing that medicine to those patients as quickly and equitably as possible. Participation in clinical trials should be the primary route by which patients get access to investigational medicines and contribute to the collection of safety and efficacy data needed to support regulatory approval worldwide. These clinical studies are needed to demonstrate that the medicine meets the standards for safety and efficacy that government regulatory agencies have established for granting approval. Gaining regulatory approval for a medicine is the best way to bring rapid access to the greatest number of patients who may benefit.
For patients with a serious or life-threatening disease who are ineligible or unable to participate in a clinical trial, use of an expanded access program 
 an option. Depending on country regulations and the program criteria, access to investigational medicines may be provided through Expanded Access Programs (EAP) (known as compassionate use programs in certain jurisdictions), or Country-Specific Authorization to Use cohorts.
The following criteria must be met before will consider establishing an for a investigational product:
There is an unmet medical need that cannot be met by existing products
The benefit-risk profile of the drug in the indication and the patient population is positive
There is a good understanding of the likely indication to be approved
There are definite plans to file and commercialize the drug in the region
The program will be fairly and equitably available to the population of the region in question
The program is compliant with local rules and laws
There are adequate supplies of investigational product to meet the needs of the without impairing the clinical trials program
The program must be discontinued as soon as feasible when approval of the drug is achieved in the country
Patients should consult with their healthcare provider about their eligibility to enroll in any of Merck's clinical trials and expanded access programs. To get more information about available clinical trials, vist 
If the physician feels that the patient is not able to participate in an available clinical trial and that an expanded access program may be suitable for the patient, the physician should contact to make the request on behalf of the patient. This will enable the physician to work with experts within the company to determine the appropriate course of action. Physicians seeking help on behalf of their patients in the may contact the 
. If a program exists, information will be provided to the requestor at the time of the call. If no program exists, the request will be acknowledged and noted.

From developing new therapies that treat and prevent disease to helping people in need, 
is committed to improving health and well-being around the world. 
 is one way our company is acting on this commitment. Each year, as many as 30 Fellows are selected to work with non-profit organizations for a three-month assignment.  Fellows are referred to as Richard Clark (RTC) Fellows in honor of retired Chairman and Richard Clark.
Between 2012 and 2018, 188 Fellows from 34 countries have worked with 36 non-governmental organization (NGO) partners.  The program has touched thousands of lives in underserved communities around the world.
This year, employees left their regular posts to travel to South Africa for a week-long onboarding session. Now, they are taking on this important hands-on leadership experience to work with partners in sub-Saharan Africa, Central Asia, India and the United States. The Fellows will provide strategic and tactical support to their partners and will use their expertise to help the organizations solve pressing health care challenges by working to build capacity and provide increased access to health products, services and education in the communities they serve.
Advancing the Sustainable Development Goals 
In 2015, world leaders gathered in New York City for the 70th United Nations General Assembly, during which they formally adopted the 
. These goals - 17 in total - represent the internation community's aspirations for improving the lives of the world's poortest people by 2030.
The Fellowship for Global Health directly contributes to:
Our company is committed to discovering smart, sustainable ways to expand access to health care, especially in areas with limited infrastructure and resources.
 Given the significance of this challenge, it is only by working in partnership with others—governments, donors, patient organizations, health care professionals, NGOs, academic institutions, multilateral organizations and the private sector—that we can we make the strongest contribution. The Fellowship for Global Health is built on the notion of partnering to strengthen the capacity and reach of nonprofit organizations which, in turn, will ultimately solve some of the world’s greatest healthcare challenges.
The program continues to make valuable contributions to improve global health. 
The 2017 results of our annual impact survey show that all partners are extremely or very likely to implement the Fellows’ recommendations and 90 percent reported extraordinary or substantial capacity gains as a result of the Fellows’ work.
For more than a century, our company has been inventing for life, bringing forward medicines for many of the world's most challenging diseases .. .The Fellowship program underscores our commitment to overcoming the greatest obstacles to health and well-being. The Fellows apply their scientific, operational and technical expertise to achieve long-term solutions that, ultimately, have meaningful impact and broaden the reach of advances in health care."

Taking Population Health to Employees - Good Health is Smart Business
Cathryn Gunther, associate vice president, Global Population Health, Population Health is an approach that aims to materially improve the health of specific populations.  At Merck, known as outside the and Canada, we apply population health principles to improve the health of our global workforce of more than 69,000 employees.   In keeping with our company’s business mission to save and improve lives, we are committed to helping our employees be healthy and stay safe.
The classic definition of population health is:
 “The health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of such outcomes within the group.” 
At Merck, we know that good health goes beyond physical well-being to include emotional, social and financial well-being. Only when our employees feel at their best, in all aspects of their lives, can they perform at their best.
We provide employees with access to a wide variety of health services, programs, resources and tools to support their health and well-being. 
 was introduced in the in Sept. 2011 to bring together the health and wellness offerings under one platform. 
 - Holistic Approach to Wellbeing Designed by and for Employees Their Families
 as a foundation for building a local culture of well-being. In Canada, for example, we demonstrated improvements in biometrics, fitness and emotional health, accompanied by fewer self-reported absences. 
 has launched to 53,000 employees in 40 countries, representing over 75 percent of the workforce. 
At Merck, we define a culture of well-being as a deliberate and resourced effort to establish a workforce culture that promotes health, wellness and safety and is focused on creating healthy daily habits. It embeds health and safety into the daily fabric of the workplace. We recognize that a sustainable culture of health requires strong leadership support, a grass-roots champion network (dedicated and passionate employee volunteers), a workplace environment that supports healthful decision-making and a strong and lasting commitment to market the value of being well within and across the organization. 
There are many benefits to this approach. First, the health and well-being of our workforce have a direct link to optimal employee performance. Whether work is done at the office or at home, sickness, injury and stress can affect a person’s ability to perform and contribute effectively. 
Second, there is increasing evidence that a healthy and safe workforce can provide a competitive advantage in the marketplace. has an opportunity to be an example for other companies by sharing learnings, best practices and evidence that supports the hypothesis that good health is smart business. We also believe that a constructive approach to our employees' health and overall well-being helps to recruit and retain top and diverse talent. Aspiring to play a leadership role, is leveraging internal assets and external expertise to promote health and build a corporate culture of health.  
Because at we are 
 to promote optimal health, we must lead by example. We must be healthy ourselves to do the important work of saving and improving the lives of others.

How Will You Invent the Future?
My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
is working to save and improve lives around the world by inventing breakthrough medicines and vaccines – and ensuring they are available and affordable to patients who need them.
We have invested more than 
 in research and development since 2010. 
Our investments fund the pursuit of life-changing discoveries to address critical medical needs in diseases that affect so many, including cancer and infectious diseases. 
Medicines and Vaccines Benefit People and the
Medicines and vaccines created by innovative pharmaceutical companies including are allowing millions of people worldwide to live longer, healthier, more productive lives. Medicines and vaccines also benefit health care systems and society because of their potential to reduce other costs in the system. 
Innovative medicines have played an integral role in improving life expectancy over the last century.
In addition to reducing the burden of disease and saving lives, 
The value of reductions in work days lost and hospital admissions in the thanks to pharmaceutical innovation is estimated to be 
 than the cost of new drugs used. 
one percent increase in the number of prescriptions filled would cause Medicare’s spending on medical services to fall by 
 according to a 2012 study by the Congressional Budget Office. 
Generic Medicines: Providing Value for the Long Term
Every generic drug on the market today started as an innovative, branded medicine. The process of patent-protected medicines becoming low-priced generics is one of the greatest aspects of our health care system in the United States. 
Generics help create budget offsets to fund new innovative treatments, while at the same time enabling spending on medicines to remain a small share of overall health care spending. That’s why we’re proud that in 2016, more than 42 million Americans benefited from discoveries that are now generic medicines. 
 Americans benefited from discoveries that are now generic medicines. 
For years, spending on all prescription medicines (branded and generic) has remained at 
 of total health expenditures in the United States.
We Recognize That More Needs to Be Done to
Overall health care spending is predicted to grow to 20 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2025. In addition, the out-of-pocket costs paid by consumers for health care services are projected to increase each year through 2025. These trends are not sustainable, and is working with others to find solutions that will result in better health outcomes and lower costs. 
Both in the United States and globally, we are working with a broad range of stakeholders to help develop and advance innovative financing and payment models with the objective of improving access. 
We support policy solutions that will directly address incentives in the health care system that cause many patients to pay high out-of-pocket costs for their medicines. We support the role of generic drug manufacturers in providing low cost products once intellectual property rights have expired. 
In 2017, we introduced our first biosimilar in the United States at a list price 35 percent below the list price of its reference product. We also support policy changes to encourage greater biosimilar adoption.
In the United States, where patients share in the cost of their health care, we have 
 to help eligible patients who cannot afford their medications. 
“We understand that we can only be successful when the people who need our medicines and vaccines can get them. That’s why we are working so hard to address the affordability of medicines – and the cost of health care in general.”
We are Committed to Responsible Pricing Practices 
 We have a long history of responsibly pricing our medicines and vaccines to reflect their value to patients, payers and society. 
 was the first pharmaceutical company to 
 a multi-year report about our pricing practices, including the rebates and discounts we provide to payers in the United States. 
In 2018, we committed to not increase the average net price across our portfolio of products in the by more than inflation annually. 
We are committed to inventing medicines and vaccines that save and improve lives around the world. It’s the most important thing we do. And we know we have to make sure that our inventions get into the hands of people who need them. That’s why we’re committed to addressing access and affordability – and ensuring that we can continue to invest in the next generation of inventions.

We work with these groups because they represent the pharmaceutical industry and business community in debates led by governments and other stakeholders, and because they are important in helping to reach industry consensus on policy issues. At times we may not share the views of our peers or associations. representatives on the boards and committees of industry groups and associations ensure that we voice questions or concerns we may have about policy or related activities. We may even recuse ourselves from related association or industry group activities.

Looking to become a supplier? This is the first step. 
Merck’s procurement professionals use several sources to identify qualified suppliers, as the need arises. Our supplier diversity database is the first stop in our supplier searches.
Ensure that we have your most up-to-date business information.
Enable you to upload files that will help us fully understand your company's capabilities.
Confirm that your company satisfies our “proof of certification” requirements.
You will receive an e-mail confirming that your registration is complete.
We will contact you if we have questions or need additional information.
We will contact you regarding next steps only if opportunities at exist that match the products and/or services that you provide.
Please note:  Registration in our Supplier Diversity database does not certify a supplier as an approved, qualified or authorized supplier; guarantee award of a contract; obligate 
                            to solicit a request for quotation; or indicate that your company will be considered to bid on procurement opportunities.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
							Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) — diseases that can’t be transmitted from person to person — are the leading causes of death and disability worldwide.
The five main types of NCD
(such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma)
While systems in the developed world to address NCDs are relatively advanced, NCDs continue to pose an increasing burden on health and economic development in developing countries — where 80 percent of NCD-related deaths take place.
To help address this challenge, is proud to be a founding member of 
 — a global initiative to advance access to non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention and care in low and lower-middle income countries (LICs and LMICs). Launched during the World Economic Forum 2017 Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Access Accelerated brings together 22 biopharmaceutical companies that will work in partnership with the World Bank and the Union of International Cancer Control (UICC).
Merck’s Past and Future Commitment to Care
New medicines and vaccines are essential in the effort to address the public health burden of NCDs.
Throughout our long history, has pioneered numerous novel approaches to prevent and treat NCDs — particularly in diabetes, cancer and cardiovascular disease. In 2017, our research and development expenses were $10.2 billion for conditions including NCDs.
We have a responsibility not only to discover innovative medicines, but also to innovate in how we improve them, how we use technology, and how we partner with the health community to bring them to the people who need them. All stakeholders – governments, industry, civil society, patients and caregivers — need to engage in creative and collaborative partnerships to address NCDs.
We are committed to broadening the number of solutions available to patients and helping decrease the affliction of NCDs.
The surest remedy for any disease is to invent the best medicine or vaccine and ensure that the broadest number of patients have access to it.
— Ken Frazier, Chairman CEO, Helping to Achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represent the international community’s aspirations for improving the lives of the world’s poorest people. To date, there has been no greater effort to overcome extreme poverty, poor health, hunger and other development challenges. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes NCDs as a major challenge for sustainable development and aims to reduce by one third premature mortality from NCDs by 2030.
and commitment to supporting the SDG
Merck's Access to Health Statement of Guiding Principles
Access to health supports Merck’s overall mission to discover, develop and produce innovative products and services that save and improve lives around the world. To guide our efforts, we follow our companywide 
, which articulates our approach and aspirations in the areas of Research and Development, Manufacturing and Supply, Registration, Commercialization, and Community Investment.

My Career Journey @Frank Clyburn
Engaging in Public Policy Responsibly
is committed to participating constructively and responsibly in the political process. Government proposals to regulate the health care system may directly affect the company's business and incentives for pharmaceutical innovation. Also, there are important policy initiatives that can further the company's goals with respect to increasing patient access to medicines and vaccines -- particularly for patients in disadvantaged communities and regions -- and, most importantly, to health care insurance coverage. It is appropriate for the company to help inform the debate on these issues in the United States and in other countries, and to do so in a responsible and ethical way.
Merck's participation in the political process is guided by the following principles:
Improving patient access to health care, including to medicines and vaccines, and
Encouraging innovation, including by protecting intellectual property rights; through government support of basic research; and by supporting efficient and effective regulatory systems.
Merck's Executive Committee has overall governing responsibility for Merck's public policy strategy, as guided by Merck's Board Committee on Public Policy and Social Responsibility. Merck's Global Public Policy Leadership Team, headed by the Vice President of Global Public Policy Corporate Responsibility, leads the development and communication of policy positions on major issues. Position statements summarizing Merck's position on key public policy issues are posted on our
