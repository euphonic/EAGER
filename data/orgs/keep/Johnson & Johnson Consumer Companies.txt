Robert Wood Johnson, former chairman from 1932 to 1963 and a member of the Company’s founding family, crafted Our Credo himself in 1943, just before became a publicly traded company. This was long before anyone ever heard the term “corporate social responsibility.” Our Credo is more than just a moral compass. We believe it’s a recipe for business success.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the defining scientific, health and economic challenges of our time. Without urgent and meaningful action to address specific diseases and system-level issues, patients, families and communities around the world will face a tremendous threat in the years ahead from untreatable infections.
