Environment, Health and Safety Policy

Our Credo states we must ensure working conditions are clean, orderly and safe; encourage better health and education; and maintain in good order the property we are privileged to use, protecting the environment and natural resources.
The pharmaceutical and personal care industries recognize the concerns raised by stakeholders regarding the presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment (PIE) and personal care products in the environment (PCPE). The major source of pharmaceuticals entering the environment is via patient excretion following use of medicine that is taken to prevent, cure or alleviate a medical condition.
