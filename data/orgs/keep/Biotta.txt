The name is symbolic of its origin. ‘Bio’ signifies organic in Switzerland and is synonymous with the quality of our superior products. Tagerwilen is the village in Switzerland where our juices are produced. Put together, ‘Bio’ and Ta’ became Biotta, an organic Swiss company/brand.
Founded in Switzerland in 1931 by Dr. Hugo Brandenberger, the organic beverage company, Biotta, has remained dedicated to our original goal of producing top-quality juice from vegetables and fruits just as nature intended–fresh from the field into the bottle.
produced and launched our first line of juices in 1957. Over the years, has farmed more than 1,700 acres of chemical-, fertilizer-, and toxic-free land — a very rare find among today’s farmland.
Along with three generations of family farmers, has established reliable and scientific organic growing techniques, protecting the natural wholesomeness and taste of all ingredients. juices use only natural and physical processing methods as opposed to commonly used chemical methods. Production routines at have a direct impact on the quality of the juices: the fewer processing steps, the higher the nutritional value.
Established in business for 60 years, including 40 years in the U.S., is one of the top selling functional juice brands in the world.  The taste of Biotta’s quality juices, along with their focus on health and wellness, are widely accepted and exported to more than 40 countries.
In 1951, committed itself to organic farming — harvesting its vegetables and fruits from healthy, living soil and organic production, both according to Swiss Organic Standards — many years before the enthusiasm for organic food really took hold. At Biotta, top quality means organic vegetables and fruit grown as nature intended. First-class raw products and painstakingly careful processing are the key to the natural flavor of juices, which are all rich with natural minerals and vitamins, to promote good health. We guarantee that no artificial additives are used. juices are 100% natural and are not made from concentrate or diluted with water.
For Biotta, the development of organic farming has been decisively shaped by two men. Dr. Rudolf Steiner, the founder of Anthroposophy, laid the foundations of what was then known as organic-dynamic farming back in the 1920s with soil management techniques. In the 1940s, Dr. Hans Müller developed the organic-biological farming method. This method is now widely used throughout the world, and is also followed by Biotta.
Quality Production
In order to produce excellent, high-quality organic juices, we place great value on research, development, production and quality assurance. The focus here is not merely on developing new products, but also on continually improving existing juice varieties. To ensure our customers are consistently offered only the very best quality, we have created teams dedicated to the development, production and quality of juices.
All organic juices are made from naturally grown vegetables and fruits. The quality of Biotta’s produce is the foundation of the nutritional value of our juices. All vegetables and fruits are field- / vine-ripened and are selected using the highest quality standards in relation to flavor and content. After thorough washing and inspection of the raw materials, the selected vegetables and fruits are placed in a closed manufacturing process. The next time oxygen and the product will meet is when the consumer opens the bottle. This process is the first of three key steps that result in Biotta’s exceptional quality.
The second key to Biotta’s quality is decanting. Instead of pressing the vegetable or fruit, where it may lose some nutritional value due to the rough process, pulls the juice out of the vegetables and fruits through a gentle process of centrifugation. Decanting separates the juice from the mash and takes only a couple of minutes, allowing maximum nutrition to be maintained in all of Biotta’s juices.
The third and final key to Biotta’s quality is our pasteurization process. juices are pasteurized at a lower temperature vs. conventional processing. The lower heat levels permit Biotta’s juices to retain high nutritional value, fresh taste and long shelf life.
During juice production, each batch is carefully monitored and regularly checked to detect any deviations in quality at the earliest possible stage.  To ensure that all these very important quality measures run smoothly, also operates a comprehensive Quality Control system, which covers the entire production process.
not only believes in producing high quality, functional juices, but also places great value on being environmentally conscious. We do so by:
Selling the unusable by-products from the processed vegetables and fruits to farmers for use as organic animal feed, ensuring that every element of the crop is put to good use.
Using only glass bottles, providing the best product protection and allowing for full retention of flavor, content and nutrients as well as recyclability.
Printing labels on FSC-certified paper in an effort to meet the social, economic and ecological needs of present and future generations.
It is of the utmost importance to us that the entire organic cycle, from cultivation to processing and production remains intact. To guarantee this to you, our products are certified by, or fulfill the requirements of the following organizations:
National Organic Program (NOP)
