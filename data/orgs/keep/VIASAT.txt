We extend the reach of networks beyond terrestrial connections with our satellite communication systems. The success of Ka-band satellite Internet in the and Europe is leading to further expansion in global markets. We support more Ka-band satellite capacity than anyone else and continue to push the state-of-the-art in network performance, applications, and economics. We also build network systems for efficient satellite data backhaul and cellular network extension.

Yonder ® high-speed mobile Internet is a global network serving business jets, maritime vessels, trains, and government customers. Our maritime partner Industries is the market leader. We believe Ka-band is the future for mobile satellite too. Our high-capacity Ka-band network is hosting in-flight broadband for commercial airlines , with JetBlue and United as inaugural customers. Piggybacking on our Exede service network, we offer portable services using compact vehicle-mounted terminals or one that packs into a case small enough to be hand carried or checked as standard-sized luggage. An office-like, two-way broadband connection to virtually any location in the and Canada opens up new possibilities for broadcast journalists, emergency first responders, law enforcement, government agencies, and live event producers.

We’re transforming satellite broadband with our high-capacity satellite system. Service providers in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and Australia have selected our systems to provide faster speeds and quicker response than ever thought possible for internet over satellite. Speed that is 10 times faster than previous satellite internet service. Our high-capacity system offers the economics, ability to serve mass markets, and the consumer experience that meets today’s demands for high-bandwidth online media and content. Launched in January 2012 using Viasat-1, the highest capacity satellite in the world, our Exede Internet service is building on subscriber base of nearly 700,000 households.

Completing the connection from satellite to the ground requires tying the satellite network into the terrestrial grid. We engineer and manufacture the large antenna systems that accomplish that task. Applications include digital television, satellite imaging, military communications, broadband networks, telemetry, satellite tracking, and teleports. We also design and produce small antennas for mobile and transportable satellite communications.

We help tactical warfighters and emergency first responders access and share trusted information from any location to make better decisions faster. Defense and homeland security organizations count on us for satcom products and capabilities at many frequency bands. Our network building blocks bring the efficiency of commercial satellite technology to milsatcom. The modem is the new military standard for the Wideband Global Satellite (WGS) system. Now designated a Current Force Modem, our LinkWay ® mesh system has eclipsed all other high-speed satellite modem installations combined. And the Joint Modem (JIPM) is the only bandwidth efficient modem certified to new military standards for networking among all forces. In addition, sthe 1990s we have been the market leader for satcom equipment.

Tactical Data Links and Line-of-Sight Networks
We’re also more than a satellite company. Link 16 tactical data links is one of our largest business areas. This joint military system gives all combatants greater situational awareness in any battle space by collecting information and combining it into a digital view of the battlefield. As one of only two qualified suppliers, has captured the lead in the global market for “MIDS” terminals and the new software-programmable Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS) version is now in full production. We also supply digital video links for unmanned systems (UAS) that increase the range, security and effectiveness of UAVs as they become a greater part of military strategy.

Cybersecurity and Information Assurance
As government and military communications have migrated to Internet Protocol (including IPv6) there’s a corresponding need to secure data traveling over the internet or other public networks or residing in digital data storage devices such as hard drives. Building primarily around the development of the High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryption Interoperability Standard (® IS), we are successfully growing its market share for Docybersecurity, encryption, and information assurance systems with both stand-alone products and modular, embeddable security.

Airborne and Command and Control on-the-move (C2OTM) are fast growing segments of our business that use the same technology as our commercial Yonder ® mobile satellite network. More capable cameras and sensors create the need for megabit speeds and video, driving the desire for performance as good as a wired cable or high-speed modem as troops move in vehicles, airplanes, and helicopters. We have also successfully won the equipment and service provider role for the next generation of Blue Force Tracking, a potential $1 billion market. The BFT-2 situational awareness network increases safety for highly mobile forces in combat.
