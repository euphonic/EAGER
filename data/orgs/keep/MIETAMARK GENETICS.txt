Metamark: Past, Present, and Future 
determine the need for initial/repeat biopsy
Always looking forward, Metamark believes that its advanced proteomics platform, together with its demonstrated expertise in biomarker identification, proteomics signature discovery, and clinical study design, will be applicable across multiple tumor types and other diseases where tissue is available.
Metamark’s executive leadership team has industry-leading experience in discovering, validating and commercializing novel diagnostic and prognostic tests. With guidance from its world-class scientific and clinical advisors, and the support of a board of directors with extensive experience in building transformational life sciences companies, Metamark is leading a shift in urological cancer care, to a world in which patients and their physicians make more informed treatment decisions based on the latest proteomic science.
Compared to other commercially available diagnostic and prognostic test platforms, Metamark's cutting-edge, proprietary quantitative multiplex in situ imaging (QMPI) technology has distinct advantages, including sensitivity and accuracy, ability to predict progression risk at very early-stage disease, ability to overcome challenges of tumor heterogeneity, and fully automated, digitalized tissue analyses independent of subjective interpretations.
In contrast to standard gene-based tests where the tissue sample is ground up and levels of individual genes in diseased tissue are diluted with normal tissue values, Metamark measures protein biomarkers in the regions of the intact tissue where they are altered during disease. This enables detection of even very small changes in a biomarker, and requires much less tissue to run the test than what is routinely required for genetics-based tests.
Predicting Progression Risk at Early Disease Stage
Metamark can not only measure protein levels, but also protein activity states in intact tissues. In contrast to a majority of genetic alterations that usually occur in a fraction of patients with a particular disease and usually at later stages of disease, certain core proteins have deregulated activity at an early stage of disease and therefore are informative for virtually 100% of patients with a particular disease.
The ability to measure multiple proteins at the same time on intact tissue is crucial to relate the proteins to the same stage and grade of disease. If biomarkers are measured individually from different parts of the tumor, the biomarkers would represent different disease grades and it would not be possible to combine the biomarkers into a signature that accurately predicts progression risk.
The Metamark platform does not rely on subjective interpretation of which regions of the tissue sample should be used for the biomaker measurements. The measurements are made in molecularly defined "regions-of-interest", and therefore are fully reproducible and objective.
Metamark's comprehensive proprietary approach gives physicians and patients information they need to make better informed decisions.
Metamark's molecular test information gives greater specificity than testing alone.
Metamark's molecular tests can be more sensitive, as they are less prone to "geographic sampling error".
