On behalf of Humanetics, would like to sincerely thank you for being our valued customer and for your continued support as we strive to serve you better.   It is our wish to thank you and also provide an update of our company’s performance as we have done on several occasions during the past few years.  At the time of our merger in 2010, we communicated to our customers worldwide and made key promises that we would accomplish certain goals.  These promises included:
 Improving the financial stability of our company to ensure long-term stability for  our customers;
 commitment to re-invest back into our business to improve customer service,  while continuing the development of existing and new safety products and;
 continued commitment to the improvement of both quality & delivery.  
Today, I’m very happy to report our progress related to these promises, as follows: Financial Stability In recent years, we have been able to consolidate within our facilities and standardize engineering & manufacturing systems and related processes to achieve higher efficiencies, reduce lead times and improve quality in our manufacturing operations.  By partnering with our investment group, we have been able to collectively invest over $60 million back into the business.  This continued investment has secured financial stability and enables to invest in development and manufacturing as occupant safety continues to advance worldwide.  No other ATD, instrumentation, or ‘crash test’ supplier has ever reinvested this level of long term financial commitment to insure continued stability for our customers.
Re-investment in Company: As promised, reinvested back into the business to: 1. Improve manufacturing performance, 2. Increase engineering capabilities; and 3. Improve customer service.  For example, we invested over $30 million in new manufacturing equipment and capital expenditures to improve our quality, on-time delivery and reduce lead times.  has added over 188 new employees worldwide, including 43 within Engineering and Program Management, to support existing and new product development.   has invested over $7 million per year in Research & Development and Engineering of new products such as and World In total, has invested over $35 million in the past few years for Research & Development and Engineering of new products to satisfy the advancing safety requirements of future crash safety.
has significantly improved our service commitments to our customers and expanded support for new ATDs such as the THOR, WorldSID, PLEX-and Dummies, while striving for a new level of communication, transparency, and customer satisfaction.  We've established new worldwide in-house training programs, both for our customers and our internal staff. These sessions cover a broad range of topics including dummy background, handling, data processing, certification, and disassembly with multiple training sessions available throughout the year in the US, Europe, and Asia. We've expanded our service staff to accommodate the growth of the new advanced dummies and improve the care customers receive. This year we introduced an Complexity Reduction Program in order to simplify the purchasing process for integrated ATDs by offering tiers of standardized option menus. Our new Maintenance Program is a comprehensive care and savings package for our customers.
Improved Quality & Delivery:  Based on recent investments of over $6 million, has improved quality by 39.5% and reduced delivery time by an additional 14%.  Humantics introduced the Platinum Express spare parts program providing our global customers immediate shipment of the most common spare parts for our ATDs within 24 hours of ordering.  has also positioned over $2 million in common spare stock throughout our global offices worldwide.  This increase in spare stock, coupled with our substantial capacity improvements, has allowed to yield an average spare delivery of less than four weeks.  In fact, many customers have recently reported spare part delivery in less than one week!

 - to become the exclusive provider of the dummy positioning and pre- and post-crash measurement systems.
Innovative Solutions, Inc., the global leader in the development of biofidelic crash test dummies and custom sensor solutions, today announced it has signed a commercial agreement with 3Systems GmbH, a leading provider of optical camera-based 3measuring systems acquired by Hexagon in 2016.  Under the agreement, becomes the exclusive provider of AICON’s Dummy Positioning System (DPS) and pre- and post-crash measurement system (ProCam Crash) to the global marketplace. The combination of and the systems allow to provide customers a broader range of vehicle safety testing systems.
Using the DPS, crash test dummies can be positioned for complete vehicle crashes, sled testing and calibration with minimum preparation time, leading to cost savings for the customer. Its advantages include speed and accuracy, since all the points marked on the crash test dummy (head, H-point, knees) are simultaneously captured and deviations from the target position are displayed in real-time. The hand-held ProCam system is used for the pre- and post-crash measurement of crash vehicles to detect interior and exterior deformations. The seamless combination of the ProCam and significantly improves the efficiency of the pre-crash preparation and post-crash measurement processes.
“The safety products are natural additions to our portfolio of advanced safety products and add significant value for our customers,” said Christopher O’Connor, of Humanetics. “The Dummy Positioning System is a critical tool that dramatically reduces pre-crash set-up time, while offering robust and repeatable results. The ProCam system offers customer a highly flexible alternative to a conventional or articulated arm for pre- and post-crash measurements.”
Werner Boseman, of added, “As the leading manufacturer of crash test dummies, is the perfect partner to promote these two systems. While will continue to provide its core 3camera technology for both products, has the scale, global network, and sector experience to make these two products market leaders in the vehicle safety testing sector.”
