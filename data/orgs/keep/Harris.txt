The 2,408 mile flight was 600 miles more than Charles Lindbergh's previous transatlantic flight.

In 2017, a group of #HarrisCorp employees created a new oyster bagging machine which slashed the time it takes to fill individual bags with oyster shells.
This weekend, more employees used that same machine to complete 741 shell bags, exceeding their goal of 700.
These efforts help to restore and preserve the Indian River Lagoon. Oysters, which used to be plentiful but now have small naturally occurring populations, are excellent for the lagoon because their filter feeding cleans the water.
Great work, team!
Don't worry, we'll tweet the answers on Wednesday!
#HarrisCorp presented its annual donation to #Thetoday during the organization’s winter conference. The donation will help members by providing additional training and education.

Innovation has been the cornerstone of Harris’ success since its founding more than 125 years ago – and it remains the driving force behind everything we do. From its printing-press roots, has transformed itself into a leading technology innovator, solving customers’ toughest mission-critical challenges by providing solutions that connect, inform and protect. The company today provides a wide range of differentiated technologies to support government and commercial customers in more than 100 countries, and has more than $6 billion in annual revenue.
The Early Days
Harris’ innovative spirit was spawned out of necessity by two entrepreneurs whose first invention – a faster printing press – launched the Automatic Press Company.
The company went on to create many new innovations, merged with two other printing equipment companies, and by midcentury emerged as one of the world's largest printing equipment manufacturers.
As the Space era arrived, began transforming into an electronic communications company with the acquisition of Radiation Inc., a premier developer of miniaturized electronic tracking and pulse code technologies for America's fledgling space program. The nation's earliest communication and weather satellites, military missile systems, manned space flights and Apollo moon missions all relied on Radiation technologies to complete their missions.
In the 1970’s, the renamed moved its headquarters to Melbourne, Florida. And by the turn of the century, had celebrated its centennial and completed its transition from a printing company into a global communications and information technology company.
In 2015, continued its transformation by acquiring Exelis Inc., creating a company with greater scale, capabilities, and core franchises focused primarily on and international government markets where the company provides differentiated technologies.
“Continually pushing the boundaries of technology through innovation has always been an essential part of Harris’ culture.”
Chairman, President and CEO
Innovation, Focus, Execution
today is a proven leader in

Space and Intelligence Systems
Harris’ innovation is driven by the passion, hard work and dedication of our 7,900 engineers and scientists who routinely push technology boundaries and invent solutions to solve our customer’s most critical challenges.
To fuel their innovative spirit, invests an industry-leading 5-plus percent of revenues in research and development and creates advanced facilities that promote innovation and collaboration – such as the Global Innovation Center and Technology Center in Florida and the world's most advanced tactical radio manufacturing center in New York.
Technology Center in Palm Bay, Florida
Global Innovation Center in Melbourne, Florida
Jefferson Road Operations Center in Rochester, New York
also invests to foster the next generation of innovators – with the company contributing millions of dollars and employees volunteering thousands of hours to support Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) related initiatives at every grade level. Examples include training elementary students in skills to help them prepare for business careers, sponsoring a high school in a national astronaut challenge and funding a university innovation incubator program.
