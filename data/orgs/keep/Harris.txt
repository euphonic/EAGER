“wanted the flight just to contribute. could only hope one more passage across that part of the Pacific would mark a little more clearly the pathway over which an air service of the future will inevitably ply,” said Earhart on the flight.
#HarrisCorp joined 18 companies and entities across 8 countries at Hudson Institute to develop the first-ever standards for quantum key distribution (QKD), laying the foundation of a more secure internet.
“The submission of the first global and Quantum Random Number Generator recommendations is a vital step in the transition to the future of quantum communications and adoption of industry standards,” said CTO, Ross Niebergall.
#HarrisCorp congratulates Alachua County Sheriff's Office Dispatcher, Jeff Andress. Jeff was honored with the Dispatcher of the Year Award this week at the Florida Sheriffs Association winter conference in Washington, D.C.
“The work of a dispatcher is truly heroic. They play such an important role during people’s most vital times of need,” – Max Green, vice president Public Safety and Professional Communications sales.
In 2017, a group of #HarrisCorp employees created a new oyster bagging machine which slashed the time it takes to fill individual bags with oyster shells.
This weekend, more employees used that same machine to complete 741 shell bags, exceeding their goal of 700.
These efforts help to restore and preserve the Indian River Lagoon. Oysters, which used to be plentiful but now have small naturally occurring populations, are excellent for the lagoon because their filter feeding cleans the water.

Innovation has been the cornerstone of Harris’ success since its founding more than 125 years ago – and it remains the driving force behind everything we do. From its printing-press roots, has transformed itself into a leading technology innovator, solving customers’ toughest mission-critical challenges by providing solutions that connect, inform and protect. The company today provides a wide range of differentiated technologies to support government and commercial customers in more than 100 countries, and has more than $6 billion in annual revenue.
Harris’ innovative spirit was spawned out of necessity by two entrepreneurs whose first invention – a faster printing press – launched the Automatic Press Company.
The company went on to create many new innovations, merged with two other printing equipment companies, and by midcentury emerged as one of the world's largest printing equipment manufacturers.
As the Space era arrived, began transforming into an electronic communications company with the acquisition of Radiation Inc., a premier developer of miniaturized electronic tracking and pulse code technologies for America's fledgling space program. The nation's earliest communication and weather satellites, military missile systems, manned space flights and Apollo moon missions all relied on Radiation technologies to complete their missions.
In the 1970’s, the renamed moved its headquarters to Melbourne, Florida. And by the turn of the century, had celebrated its centennial and completed its transition from a printing company into a global communications and information technology company.
In 2015, continued its transformation by acquiring Exelis Inc., creating a company with greater scale, capabilities, and core franchises focused primarily on and international government markets where the company provides differentiated technologies.
“Continually pushing the boundaries of technology through innovation has always been an essential part of Harris’ culture.”
today is a proven leader in 
. We deliver these solutions through three business segments: 
Harris’ innovation is driven by the passion, hard work and dedication of our 7,900 engineers and scientists who routinely push technology boundaries and invent solutions to solve our customer’s most critical challenges.
To fuel their innovative spirit, invests an industry-leading 5-plus percent of revenues in research and development and creates advanced facilities that promote innovation and collaboration – such as the Global Innovation Center and Technology Center in Florida and the world's most advanced tactical radio manufacturing center in New York.
Technology Center in Palm Bay, Florida
Global Innovation Center in Melbourne, Florida
also invests to foster the next generation of innovators – with the company contributing millions of dollars and employees volunteering thousands of hours to support Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) related initiatives at every grade level. Examples include training elementary students in skills to help them prepare for business careers, sponsoring a high school in a national astronaut challenge and funding a university innovation incubator program.

Brothers Invent First Automatic Printing Press Feeder
Frustrated by the slow pace of getting flyers printed for their jewelry business, Charles and Alfred build a sheet feeder for printing presses that automated what had been a slow, manual process.
The Automatic Press Company incorporates and goes into business Dec. 23, 1895 in two rooms in an old house in Niles, Ohio in which President McKinley had been born.
The first automatic press, called the E-1, ships to Brooks Printing in November 1897. This was a huge breakthrough that could deliver the unbelievable amount of 15,000 cards or envelopes an hour - 10 times what the most skilled pressmen could feed by hand. 
Charles dies in June 1910. His brother, Alfred Harris, continues to run the business. 
pair of the world's first two-color offset lithographic presses sell for $50,000 to the Traung Brothers Company, representing pivotal adoption of the new technology.
The Automatic Press Companies merges with Seybold Machine Company of Dayton, Ohio and the Premier-Potter Company of Derby, Connecticut. The name of the company changes to Harris-Seybold-Potter. The merger combines talents and patents for advancing technologies.
The printing industry did not escape the shock of the Great Depression, Harris' survival depends on the loyalty of dedicated employees. The Traung Brothers came to Alfred Harris. "We want you to build us a four-color press", they said. Harris' four-color presses begins moving into commercial printing and publishing.
Alfred Harris' son, Alfred Stull Harris, becomes president (fifth, counter-clockwise from lower right). Stull later founds the Chemical Research Labratory for quality control of chemicals and plates used in lithography, giving a great lead over competitors as the only offset press manufacturer who thoroughly understood the process.
In support of war efforts, developed the bombsight that enabled precision bombing from high altitudes, tecchnology that helped hasten the end of WWII.
The company continues to transform the printing industry by introducing advanced offset lithography technology.
Alfred Stull dies and George Dively (standing) takes the helm at Harris. Dively joined in 1937. He was a Harvard business school graduate and a man of vision.
