Grabit Revolutionizes Factory and Warehouse Automation with Flex
Grabit Revolutionizes Factory and Warehouse Automation with Flex
Today’s factories and warehouses need automation technologies that can handle fragile electronics such as flat-screen TVs and solar panels. Until recently, robotics offered only two options: suction and mechanical gripping. Both were limited and often called for expensive, part-specific customizations. Grabit invented a new technology to revolutionize factory and warehouse automation, a multibillion-dollar market. But it had to undergo rigorous testing before it could launch.
Grabit, an industrial automation and material handling startup, wanted to bring its innovative, patented, electroadhesion gripping technology to market. It needed a partner with deep manufacturing experience and supply-chain solutions expertise. Grabit found the ideal partner in Flex Lab IX® startup incubator, which helps emerging technology startups bring solutions to market that make tomorrow’s disruptive products possible.
By working with the Lab startup incubator, Grabit was able to accelerate time to build connections, speed its time to market and secure funding from Flex to further develop electroadhesion-based products for industrial robotics and warehouse logistics.
Electroadhesion grippers

“Flex brings a wealth of manufacturing experience and supply chain solutions expertise to support our growth.”
Charlie Duncheon, former and co-founder of Grabit Inc
Accelerating the pace of innovation
Grabit worked with our electrostatic discharge experts at the 
 in Austin, Texas, where they performed testing and characterization of the grippers to reveal potential issues — ultimately demonstrating that the technology could offer a flexible, energy-saving way to handle delicate and hard-to-grasp items.
Catalyzing business connections
After testing, Grabit and Flex co-developed a white paper to show prospective customers how the grippers would excel in a variety of conditions affected by temperature, humidity and other factors. Our team leveraged its cross-industry partnerships to make key introductions between Grabit and leading companies with specialty manufacturing and warehousing needs.
Today, Grabit is poised to fundamentally change factory and warehouse automation with its cost and energy-saving technology.

mobile diabetes management system 
The inspiration for the world’s first e-connected mobile diabetes management system came from the most unlikely of places: Space. Dr. Julian Shapley, Cellnovo’s Founder and Chief Scientific Officer, was working with astronauts at in the United States when he became intrigued by the properties of a paraffin wax pump used in satellites. Its high level of accuracy and precision in the delivery of fluids seemed well adapted for use in healthcare applications.  
Scaling from start-up volumes to mass production is a test many young companies face, and it is exactly this challenge that the Franco-Welsh medical device company was confronted with in 2014. Cellnovo originally set up a production facility in South Wales. Quickly, demand outstripped supply and the company struggled to keep pace with orders for its product. After a successful in Paris in 2015, Cellnovo set its sights on industrializing production to enable it to meet this growing demand. Being able to reliably supply the disposable insulin cartridges in greater volumes was key to success.

- Sophie Baratte, CEO, Cellnovo
  - Chris Townsend, Chief Operating Officer, Cellnovo
The highly-experienced engineering team, working closely with Cellnovo, assessed the suitability of the existing designs for volume manufacture, and where necessary, helped re-design components. 
Unit cost was also a major consideration, and the design team’s understanding of materials, manufacturing processes and medical device regulations ensured the new specifications were optimized for cost, reliability and performance.   
Improvements in the manufacturing process for the lead frame and the pinned circuit board immediately led to capacity improvements.
Partnering with Flex enables Cellnovo to focus on its core competencies: Innovation and the differentiation of its product, and bringing superior value to patients, their families and care teams.
It also means Cellnovo is now capable of delivering a 12-fold increase in the number of insulin cartridges produced per annum. In 2019, a second production line is planned to go live at Flex in Timisoara, Romania, which would dramatically increase Cellnovo’s insulin cartridge production.
Because Flex produces medical devices to the highest international quality standards, Cellnovo’s management team are assured that the production complies with international regulatory and safety standards.
We partner with healthcare companies to deliver an intelligent, HIPAA-compliant medical-grade platform that complies with critical security regulations.                    Learn More
