The MedCart product line, previously called MedCart, originated at Modern Metal in Greensboro, North Carolina, which once served as a manufacturing division for X-Ray. In 1999, all divisions relocated to Houston, where we opened a modern 155,000 square foot manufacturing facility.
and illuminators and motorized viewers help automate film interpretation in radiology reading rooms worldwide. The sophistication of these machines extends to the user interface, as radiologists comfortable with stationary light boxes easily adapt to RADX’s horizontal belt systems and X-Ray’s vertical panel and belt viewers. Most recent product offerings include the Digital Viewing Station and the Mammography Workstation. Both of these allow radiology departments to transition easily from film to a fully digital environment, using an ergonomically designed, functional workstation. The lower section of these stations support monitors for evaluating digital images, while the upper part holds a motorized viewer or a standard illuminator for comparing newer images to earlier hard-copy images.
