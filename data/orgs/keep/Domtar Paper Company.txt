Montreal (Québec) H31L6Managing Our Waste Byproducts
We are constantly striving to send less waste to landfills. Thanks to our continuous improvement initiatives and engineering innovations, we are turning more raw materials into saleable products. We are also finding innovative uses for our manufacturing byproducts that have historically been viewed as “waste,” and our culture of sharing and replicating best practices has enabled us to accelerate our progress in diverting these materials from landfills. We can now envision a future with virtually zero waste going to landfills.
Created with Highcharts 4.2.7
Agricultural and Silvicultural Soll Improvement 36%
Energy Generation 25%
Manufactured Soil/Compost 3%
in waste to landfill at pulp and mills since 2013
Waste reduction efforts include source reduction and beneficial re-use programs. Our progress in diverting materials from landfills has accelerated in the past few years, driven by a consistent approach to defining, measuring and reporting byproduct streams.
manufacturing byproducts beneficially reused in 2017
This figure is up from 58 percent in 2013.  The industry average is 47 percent. Seventy-four percent of what was previously considered waste is now being beneficially reused.
Turning Waste Into Nutrients
Farmers in eastern North Carolina are excited about a fertilizer option available from Domtar’s  Plymouth Mill . Plymouth K-Lime is a potassium (periodic table symbol: K) and lime blend that’s creating healthier crops, saving farmers money and reducing the amount of waste being sent to the landfill by the mill. It’s a win-win-win situation that has captured the attention of the industry and has earned two awards for environmental leadership.
Our Other WebsitesWe recognize that water is a local resource. Our facilities develop site-specific management strategies using their understanding of the unique environmental and socio-economic characteristics of their watersheds. We are developing additional tools, such as a full cost of water model, to enable our facilities to be even better stewards of our shared water resources.
in water use at our mills since 2013
Pulp and manufacturing requires a lot of water. Fortunately, all of our mills are located in watersheds with ample water supplies. We treat and return about 90 percent of the water we use to the watersheds where we operate. The remainder returns to the atmosphere through evaporation, and a small amount remains in the products we manufacture.
water is reused in a mill
Given our access to abundant, inexpensive water supplies, we do not want to fall into the trap of taking the resource for granted. That is why we are developing models that our mills can use to better understand the full cost of using water in their operations. This will enable our mills to make smarter decisions to lower our manufacturing costs and water access risks.
Improving Water Quality From the Ground Up
Pulp and manufacturing requires a lot of water. Fortunately, pulp and mills are located in watersheds with ample water supplies. However, with good fortune comes great responsibility, and we are committed to protecting water quality at all of our manufacturing locations.
