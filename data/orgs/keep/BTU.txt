Utilities in Bryan became municipally owned in 1909 following a fire that burned down Bryan City Hall and Opera House. The failure of the privately owned Bryan Ice, Water & Light to put out the blaze spurred the City to run the utility system itself to prevent such issues in the future.
In 1911 the City of Bryan purchased its first electric distribution system from Bryan Ice, Water & Light for $7,650, and street lights on Main Street in Downtown Bryan were installed.
In 1913, Bryan Ice, Water & Light posted their first profit of $874, at a time when milk was $0.13 per gallon. The company also installed their first diesel engine generator.
The citizen of Bryan officially owned, what was then called the Bryan Power Company, as of 1919. At this time there were approximately 768 customers being served by the company, primarily for lighting.
Between 1921 and 1925 streetlights were installed in certain residential areas of Bryan, including east and west 26th Street, Bryan Hospital, and Fannin School.
As Bryan continued to grow, it became clear to City Commissioners that another generation unit was needed to produce enough electricity for the citizens. In 1925 the city power plant ordered an additional unit.
As the Great Depression began coming to a close, the City of Bryan joined in the relief efforts by obtaining a loan from the Rural Electric Administration (REA) to establish a Rural Electric division in 1938. The service territory was expanded to customers in Brazos, Burleson, and Robertson counties. Approximately 800 miles of powerline were installed, and the rural division extended as far west as Tunis in Burleson County, and as far north as Wheelock in Robertson County.
The Bryan Municipal Power Plant was built on Atkins Street, beginning with one steam electric unit. It would eventually be home to seven generating units.
By the time the City of Bryan entered the 70’s, had grown to well over 1200 municipal and residential customer. It became clear that a more modern generating facility was needed. The Roland Dansby Power Plant, named for former Mayor Dansby, was built 5 miles north of the City of Bryan in 1978 with one steam unit, powered by natural gas with a fuel oil backup system. Lake Bryan was built as the cooling source for the plant.
join three other municipally owned utilities, Garland, Greenville, Denton, to form the Texas Municipal Power Agency (TMPA) a cooperatively built the Gibbons Creek Power Plant in Carlos Texas. The 470 lignite coal fired steam unit expanded BTU’s generation by over 100 MW.
Gibbon’s Creek abandoned lignite mining in favor of using the more economical option, western fired coal.
Dansby Power Plant received a new environmentally sensitive, and cost-effective, generating unit in 2004 to serve the growing customer base, bringing the generation capacity of the plant to 115 MW.
Atkins Power Plant was decommissioned in 2006, at the end of its lifespan.
In 2009, celebrated 100 years of serving the community with a special exhibit at the Children’s Museum of the Brazos Valley. The same year, a third generating unit was installed at Dansby Power Plant, providing even more generation to the customers of BTU.
In 2010, Automated Metering Infrastructure (AMI), also known as ‘Smart Meters’, was installed throughout the service territory. By 2012 all customer meter data was being wirelessly transmitted.
was the only public power utility in Texas in 2014 to receive the American Public Power Association’s (APPA) Reliable Public Power Provider (RP3) Diamond award. This three year designation is awarded to public power utilities who demonstrate the highest degree of reliable and safe electric service.
40 mile 138ktransmission project, which began in 2009, was completed at the end of 2014, and provided increased capacity to the existing 120 miles of infrastructure. The South Loop Project also included the construction of three new substations, Wellborn, Koppe Bridge, and Millican Switch, all located in southern Brazos County.
was recognized for a second three-year term in 2017 as an RP3 Diamond award designee.
In 2017, proudly donated a new exhibit to the Children’s Museum of the Brazos Valley called the ‘Bryan Texas Utilities Illumination Station’. The exhibit features a 4 foot by 4 foot lighted peg board, where children can exercise their creativity while also enhancing their fine motor skills. The exhibit was officially opened on August 5 for the enjoyment of all children in the Brazos Valley.

There are many areas where utilities look to remain up-to-date with technology, industry trends, innovative ideas, service offerings and research of what the future may bring. Professional trade associations are important for these reasons and many others.
The ability to network with others within the same industry allows people to share ideas, see what works for other utilities and what does not, and very importantly to remain current with regulatory, legislative and other matters that affect the public power industry.
participates with trade associations, two of the more influential ones being Texas Public Power Association (TPPA) and American Public Power Association (APPA). Trade associations are important to those of us at many public power utility systems and is no exception. employees are involved and have been involved with the associations for many years on several levels, from leadership roles to attending training courses to participating in surveys. In many cases time and money have been saved by by our association with these professional trade associations and with individuals involved in sharing experiences, ideas and research.
employees are not only involved at the state and national level through trade associations, but several employees are and have been involved with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) at leadership levels. Our former General Manager, Dan Wilkerson, served two terms on the Board of Directors, Kean Register sits on the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) and Lee Starr was Chair of the Commercial Operations Committee (COPS). Many other employees have attended training and several participate daily, minute-by-minute, with buying and selling of power.
Find out more about TPPA, and below.
Texas Public Power Association (TPPA)
Formed in 1978, the Texas Public Power Association (TPPA) represents the interests of public power providers in the state of Texas including municipally owned electric utilities, river authorities, joint action agencies, and some electric cooperatives. provides resources through which members may extend their influence on public policy matters affecting the public power industry.

Our member systems range in size from Energy of San Antonio (the largest), to the City of Goldsmith (the smallest). Together municipal utilities provide electric service to over 3 million Texans, or nearly 15% of the state’s retail electric customers.
provides news and information on issues impacting the public power industry in Texas and across the country. The Newsletter is a monthly publication designed to keep our members informed on the events, regulatory actions and legislative initiatives that affect our member systems on a daily basis.
Members section is made available to employees, boards, and/or elected officials of member systems. Eligible members have access to useful information including detailed legislative updates, committee information, marketing promotions and informational materials, and targeted Public Power education campaigns.
Public Power Systems = Low Rates and Community Value
The mission of municipally owned electric utilities is to provide value to their communities. This value premise makes public power systems fundamentally different from all other electric utilities.
Municipal utilities are locally owned and managed, with rates and policies set by city councils or citizen boards. On average, municipal utility rates are among the lowest in the state. In addition, municipal utility revenues stay in the local community, helping to keep other taxes lower. portion of these revenues are dedicated to fund general municipal services like public safety, parks and libraries.
As you can see offers a variety of services, experience, representation and leadership. Many of these tasks are accomplished through the coordination of committees. There are five ongoing committees that have support and coordination from and are led by employees of public power utilities in Texas. These committees are valuable to public power systems through discussion, research, when needed they determine direction and offer leadership which addresses current topics and issues relating to public power.
coordinates an Annual Meeting for member systems and interested parties that highlights current issues. also coordinates a Marketing and Customer Service Conference to address related topics.
The website offers information about the association and links to important sites that relate to ongoing business, www.tppa.com.
Texas Public Utility Commission
American Public Power Association (APPA)
The American Public Power Association (APPA), based in Washington, D.C., is the service organization for the nation’s more than 2,000 community-owned electric utilities. Collectively, these utilities serve more than 45 million Americans.
was created in 1940 as a nonprofit, non-partisan organization to advance the public policy interests of its members and their consumers, and provide member services to ensure adequate, reliable electricity at a reasonable price with the proper protection of the environment.
Policy positions emphasize the importance of hometown decision making that puts customers first and ensures a stable supply of electricity while protecting the environment. Since two-thirds of public power systems do not generate their own electricity and instead buy it on the wholesale market for distribution to customers, securing competitively priced and reliable wholesale power is a priority.
participates in a wide range of legislative and regulatory forums. It advocates policies that:
Ensure reliable electricity service at competitive costs.
Advance diversity and equity in the electric utility industry.
Promote effective competition in the wholesale electricity marketplace.
protect the environment and the health and safety of electricity consumers.
Safeguard the ability of communities to provide infrastructure services that their consumers require.
is governed by a regionally representative Board of Directors. About 60 staff members carry out policies and programs.
Public power is a collection of more than 2,000 community-owned electric utilities, serving over 45 million people or about 14 percent of the nation’s electricity consumers.
Public power utilities are operated by local governments to provide communities with reliable, responsive, not-for-profit electric service. Public power utilities are directly accountable to the people they serve through local elected or appointed officials.
Some of the nation’s largest cities – Los Angeles, San Antonio, Seattle and Orlando – operate publicly owned electric utilities, but many public power communities are small with their utilities serving 3,000 or fewer customers.
Benefits Public Power
Public power today is an important, contemporary American institution. From small towns to big cities, wherever public power exists, it is an expression of the American ideal of local people working together to meet local needs. It is an expression of the local control that is at the heart of our federalism system.
Public power is also a strong competitive force that provides a “yardstick” for consumers and regulators to measure the performance and rates of private power companies. This continuous competition helps all electric consumers, not just those served by public power.
However, a public power utility has many distinct characteristics that benefit the consumers of the individual community it serves. These benefits include:
Efficient service – lowest cost consistent with reliability, community goals and sound business practices.
Responsiveness to customer concerns – every citizen is an owner with a direct say in policies.
Emphasis on long-term community goals.
Quick response from crews located in the community.
Not-for-profit status – lower costs and no split allegiance between customers and stockholders.
Greater portion of revenues stay in community.
Utility purchases from local establishments, including use of local financial institutions.
Tax payments, payments-in-lieu-of-taxes , and / or transfers to the community’s general fund.
Access to tax-exempt financing for capital projects.
Cash flow of the utility, which may be channeled through local government treasury.
Opportunity for efficiency through integrated utility operations (e.g., operation with electric, water, sewer, garbage, gas, cable, telecommunications).
Improved local government efficiency through sharing of personnel, equipment and supplies.
Local management and operations bring added community leadership for innovation and development.
Recognized commitment to conservation, safety and the environment.
Local control over special programs (energy conservation, rate relief for certain customer classes, etc.)
Local control over the electric distribution system aesthetics and design.
Local control that allows matching local resources to local needs.
No economic bias toward high cost, capital intensive techniques or technologies.
Innovative techniques and technology to meet energy needs.
Primary mission of providing least-cost, reliable service over maximizing profit.
competitive standard against which the service of all utilities may be measured.

These step-by-step instructions will guide you through setting up your online payment profile in BTU’s new online payment system, and will show you how to set up automatically recurring payments, and how to sign up for paperless billing.
Log in to your existing online account
, or if you are not already an online customer, 
, and then log in to your online account.
Once you’re logged in to your online account, click on the “Recurring Payments / E-bills” button on your account summary screen.
Follow the instructions to sign in to the new payment system, or if you are a first-time visitor, follow the instructions to register in the new system.
4. Linking Your Accounts
(This is only an option if you are registering multiple accounts in the new payment system. If you only have one account, please skip to Step 5.)
Each account is tied to the email address that is entered when the account is registered in the new payment system.
However, if you have multiple different accounts that are going to be registered in the new payment system 
 you are going to use the same email address to register these accounts, then you will have the option to link all of your accounts into one dashboard so you can manage them more efficiently. You will see this screen to begin linking your accounts when you go to register your second account and then again on registering all future accounts. You are not required to link your accounts.
Welcome to your payment profile dashboard. From here, you can make online payments by credit card or e-check, set up automatically recurring payments, manage paperless billing, enable paying by text, schedule upcoming payments, and lots more. In the next section, we’ll find out how to use all of these great features.
