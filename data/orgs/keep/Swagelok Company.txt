Our Founder
was founded in 1947 by Fred Lennon (1905-1998), with a $500 loan and the promise of a colleague’s design for an easy-to-install, leak-tight tube fitting. His mantra was, “Make the best product possible to help customers succeed, and keep making it better.” From the beginning, our founder insisted on core values – Quality, Respect for the Individual, Integrity and Customer Focus – and these live on with us today.

phrase that we use a lot at is "Zero Customer Disappointments." It's a goal that is always before us.
We want our customers to have the perfect experience with every product. It works the first time. It's the same as the one before it, and the one after. It must deliver on our promise of safety and total peace of mind.
The same must be true of all of the services that surround the product – from quote input and labeling to shipping and delivery.
"Quality" is one of our six core values. It is a fundamental part of our culture. So is "Continuous Improvement." Even as we attain one target, we are setting our sights on the next one.

In many projects, fluid system components are the last to be ordered, and they are often needed next week, this week, or even today. We plan for these scenarios by staying in tune with our customers’ needs at the local level and maintaining a robust supply of Make to Stock (MTS) products – 6,200 standard products in inventory and readily available at more than 220 sales and service centers worldwide.
We also keep a large inventory of components at our main assembly plant – a considerable investment that we make for customers – so we can provide short lead times on Assemble to Order (ATO) products.
Our product availability and 99.99% shipping and inventory accuracy rate help us keep our commitment to being a resource that our customers can always rely on.
Capital Projects is dedicated exclusively to managing global coordination and all of the related issues for new construction projects around the world.

Commitment to Safety
Operating safely is a key component of one of our most deeply held values – respect for the individual – and our associates live it every day. We audit work areas three times each year to keep them clean, safe, and hazard-free. We regularly share “Clean & Safe” communications to address these issues, and we challenge associates to identify ways to improve safety.
We continue to be in the top quartile in safety metrics among our peers as we drive toward top decile performance. In 2017, lost workdays due to injury were down more than 25 percent from the previous year and were the lowest in the past six years.
Our associates take pride in maintaining safe practices throughout our facilities, some of which have gone an entire decade without a single safety incident.

Download a Short Bio
Manufacturing is in my DNA: five of six siblings in my family are engineers. I’ve strived to understand how things work for as long as can remember. There’s no doubt that my love of manufacturing environments developed through the lens of my dad’s 46 years of service as a tool and die maker at a Ford Motor engine plant in Brook Park, Ohio.
An early test of my mechanical aptitude came at age 14, when started a lawn mower repair business. serviced and sold the various brands of mowers that people would discard as trash. Within about a year, expanded my knowledge by working on heavy equipment. mentor and would go to auctions where we’d find tractors and bulldozers to weld, fix, and use or sell.
In my first job at Swagelok, ran a screw machine for a few months while finishing my engineering degree at Cleveland State University. Some people might see running a piece of equipment as mindless work. It’s not. There’s a special aptitude required to get in sync with a machine’s cadence. For me, the experience was invaluable. It was my orientation to manufacturing, and I’ve been serving ever since. Following my start on the manufacturing shop floor, served the and our customers through management and leadership roles in engineering, production, and plant management.
Today I’m responsible for our global manufacturing strategy and the methodologies we use to make products. My team watches and manages continuous improvement, new technology, the safety of our people, and the company’s sustainability goals. Swagelok’s name is built on world-class quality, and our manufacturing processes must ensure that we live up to those high standards.
One of the most important parts of my job is ensuring the broader manufacturing organization knows and understands our manufacturing strategies. That comprehension allows individuals within every plant and service group to work together on vitally important continuous improvement efforts.
When I’m giving back to the community to help others it’s often tied to the well-being of kids. served as a Big Brothers Big Sisters match for 10 years, and because my mom was a type 1 diabetic from age 10, help with diabetes groups such as

Suppliers We Can Count On
So many times in business it comes down to a date. is able to hit this date time and again due to the quality of our supply base and inventory programs.
We look long and hard to find our suppliers and apply enormous amounts of scrutiny in evaluating them. We’re looking not just at the product and quality systems, but also their values and quality of leadership.
With so much riding on our suppliers, we ask them to take extraordinary measures – in some cases, to keep their proprietary information in escrow – in others, to keep extra inventory on hand.
We take further precautions ourselves. For example, we keep significant amounts of raw materials on hand in case our supplier’s own supply chains are interrupted. And we build in redundancies with multiple suppliers for the same product.
We must do everything we can to ensure an uninterrupted flow of goods and services. That’s our promise to customers.
Suppliers We Can Count On
maintains a high performing supplier base that delivers the proper balance of cost, quality, and service to ensure we have stock on hand to meet our customers’ orders.
Supplier Code of Ethics
believes deeply in the importance of doing business with the utmost integrity. The Supplier Code of Ethics outlines the behavior and standards we expect of our business partners and ourselves.
is committed to ensuring that its suppliers do not engage in human trafficking or the use of slave labor.
Risk Management Program
proactively manages risk with a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management/Business Continuity Program. It focuses on potential threats to organizational value (physical, financial, tangible, and intangible).

We buy our bar stock direct from the mills, and then in our own manufacturing plants we forge, machine, electropolish, weld, assemble, and test, among other processes.
In other words, we own the manufacturing process from start to finish. This way we can control the maximum number of variables and ensure product quality.
We start by being very deliberate about the machines we buy because these decisions will have long-term consequences. We’re looking not just at the purchase price, but also the total cost of ownership.
In addition, we are disciplined about routine service. And we run a predictive maintenance program that addresses repairs before there is a breakdown.
We are driven to such measures by our desire for Zero Customer Disappointments, as well as our concern for the safety of our fellow associates.
owns the manufacturing process from start to finish so we can control the maximum number of variables, ensuring product quality.
ensures our equipment is as reliable as our products and services with a predictive maintenance program that delivers reliability excellence.

Download a Short Bio
As a leader, seek to do two things. First, think it’s important to have a clear vision and to be able to share that vision with the team. I’ve never been in a position where there’s been a lack of opportunity. In fact, it’s always that there are too many opportunities. So as a leader, think it’s my job to help teams focus and align behind the critical few opportunities and drive those across the finish line. That’s exciting to me and, think, to the team as well.
Second, for me, leadership is about helping people develop—being a servant leader. Several people who worked for me early in their careers are presidents or CEOs today. It’s wonderful, and it makes me so proud. think that’s where the legacy lies.
Staying true to these principles helps me make an impact every day—on the business and on my teams.
Everything I’ve done up to this point has prepared me for my current role. grew up installing equipment and turning compression fittings for my dad, who owned an in a small, North Carolina farm town. That kind of work teaches you the value of high quality and of doing things right the first time; like to say we made our living using our hands and our wit.  
But like a lot of kids, didn’t know what wanted to do for a career; didn’t have a particular calling. So after high school, enlisted in the Navy—which makes you grow up a little bit and helps you transition to becoming an adult. It’s also how paid for college.
After serving in the Navy, moved to Illinois for a job. It turned out to be a significant move, because also met and married my wife, started a family, and earned my degree at Elmhurst College.
It’s different for everyone, but at some point in your career, you start getting a line of sight. You start thinking about what you really want to do, where you think your gift lies, and where you can make the biggest impact. For me, that time came in the late 1990s. had held a few jobs by then and was working as a general manager for a climate control company; liked what was doing, and had a talent for it. That’s when knew wanted to run companies. 
That realization helped me map out my future in a purposeful way. It inspired me to challenge myself and pursue an at the University of Chicago. It also helped me take stock of my work experiences. had learned how to do acquisitions at my first couple of companies. At the next company, learned how to implement lean processes, and really developed a deep understanding of continuous improvement. looked at each future career move as an opportunity to learn a new skill and see where it led me. 
I’ve learned something from each organization I’ve worked in and in each position I’ve held, but the most important thing I’ve learned is to seek to understand—what is being done and why it is being done the way it is. Every organization has its own way of doing things, and none of them is necessarily wrong or right.
I’ve learned personal lessons, too, such as the importance of a strong support system. All of my opportunities and experiences required me to travel—a lot, and I’ve moved my family many times. couldn’t have reached my career goals without the unwavering support of my wife and two daughters, who were on their own much more than would have ever hoped.
That amazing support system and my own persistence are the two most important factors in my career so far. believe it’s about showing up every day, doing the best you can, and having a bigger vision to do what it takes.
My vision and my persistence also drive my interest in serving the community. currently serve on the board of the 
Great Lakes Science Center
, which encourages innovative thinking by making science, technology, engineering, and math accessible to all.

Download a Short Bio
As a leader, I’m always thinking about ways to get people different opportunities to stretch themselves. I’ve been fortunate, and I’ve seen how being open to opportunities can make a difference.
My family moved from Cleveland, Ohio, when was young because my dad followed an opportunity. He was a social worker, who had a chance to lead a small agency in Las Vegas, Nevada. don’t think my parents had been west of the Mississippi before we moved there, and it turned out to be a great place to grow up.
When was young, enjoyed taking apart my toys and putting them back together. quickly learned that when you had pieces left over, the toy didn’t quite work the same way. So think that’s what started me down this path of engineering.
also enjoyed math and science. So talked to my parents—a social worker and a librarian—and they helped me find an engineering camp to attend before my senior year in high school. It was a three-week program called The Making of an Engineer and was a great opportunity for me to try a lot of different activities. It’s where learned that was a lot more excited about mechanical engineering than was about electrical engineering or computer science. Plus, it gave my parents confidence to invest in an engineering degree.
One of the things that attracted me to Case Western Reserve University was their strong engineering co-op program. During my sophomore year, started interviewing with different companies, and one of them was Swagelok. left the interview thinking that a valve and fitting was much more interesting than ever imagined.
Since joining as a co-op in 1996, I’ve never looked back. Throughout my career, I’ve had opportunities to explore, learn, and grow—both as an engineer and as a leader.
After earning my degree, joined the assembly engineering group. Thanks to my co-op experience, knew had a lot of passion for new product development and talked to my boss about moving in that direction. About a year later, was asked to take part in a new rotational program for product engineers. It wasn’t exactly the new product development role was hoping for, but took the opportunity.
As a product engineer, learned what it takes to support a successful product in the field. learned what our customers struggle with, what manufacturing struggles with, what the tech service team struggles with—this role exposed me to so many groups across the organization and prepared me for a role in new product development.
One of my favorite projects in new product development was being the lead design engineer for a new stream selection valve. We were starting with a blank sheet of paper, with the goal to develop a new product that really met the needs of the marketplace. think the whole team had fun on the project, and we earned a couple of patents along the way. To this day, I’m always excited when go in the field and see that product in use.
Although tried to display personal leadership as much as could without being in a formal leadership role, was excited when an opportunity opened to lead the design engineering group. Two years later, was leading the whole new product development team. It was definitely a challenging assignment, but we had a lot of fun developing products like the medium-pressure ball valve and the series diaphragm valve.
To become a better leader, wanted to improve my communication skills. So was excited to be offered an opportunity in customer service where interacted daily with customers and distributors. grew a lot from this experience, and was promoted to director of outbound supply chain.
Next, returned to engineering as director of engineering innovations, leading all of the customer-facing areas of corporate engineering. It was a great opportunity for the team to consider how we could be more agile, take on challenges, and get closer to our markets.
continued to develop my business acumen and customer focus, serving as director of general industrial marketing and then director of operations for the fitting services group. enjoyed bringing a little more commercial acumen to operations and collaborating across the to focus on the highest priorities.
Now as vice president of engineering, want to continue to hone Swagelok’s focus on innovation. There are so many opportunities for us. It’s important for us to work closely with distributors and customers to make sure we are focusing on the right opportunities.
Along with innovation, I’m committed to continued diligence in the quality and design of our products. We occupy a space in the market that enables us to create a premium product with premium workers and processes. It’s a great place to be, and when talk to customers, they’re always appreciative that we provide products that meet their expectations. You realize that provides so much more to our customers—peace of mind and performance that enables their products and applications to do far more than they ever expected.
Outside of work, enjoy hiking and playing tennis with my two children and my wife Karie, who’s amazing; she has her Phfrom Case and is a proud member of the sociology department.
serve on the board of a small non-profit called 
Progress with Chess
. It’s really neat to see the impact that playing chess can make on children’s lives by helping them understand more about strategic thinking. also served on the grant committee for 
Komen Northeast Ohio
 and am now proud to be a member of their board.

Growing up a Army brat and watching my father interact with soldiers taught me a lot about respect. He was a senior officer, but you wouldn’t know it. His manners, actions, and emotional connection with his troops revealed a dedication to truly knowing people and building a team with a sense of mission.
The diversity and brilliance of my peers at Georgetown University and Harvard Business School taught me humility at a young age. Those college years opened my eyes to the fact that the way approach problems is one of several options – not the only way. I’ve carried that perspective throughout my career in service to the Army and subsequently for Ford Motor and Progressive Insurance, as an entrepreneur and now for Swagelok.
Effective managers and leaders are open, collaborative, trusting, and empowering. They pay attention to details with a sharp focus, while remaining flexible enough to see new facts and make adjustments. One of my earliest professional leadership tests was a change mission in the Army. was assigned to an underperforming platoon after a leader was dismissed for cause. It turned out that many of the soldiers were unmotivated to strive for success because they didn’t see how their individual efforts helped the organization. My two big lessons learned: organizations always have hidden talent and connecting people with an organization’s goals will create positive momentum.
discovered the competitive difference that organizational agility can make during my time at Progressive, where managing the knowledge cycle – making decisions, seeing results and adjusting quickly – allowed people to succeed with above average frequency and learn from failure rather than fear it.
In my current role as vice president and chief financial officer, my goal is to foster enterprise-wide financial acumen to help drive sound decision making. As a function, finance excels when it can shorten the distance between operational decisions and financial results. We have stretch goals for Swagelok’s growth and to achieve them we need a foundation that allows for scalability. It’s not as simple as hiring two of everybody or asking customers to buy double to spur growth. Our competition is getting better every day. We have to find new ways to understand customers and deliver new levels of value.
My passion for learning, continuous improvement, and our youth – tomorrow’s business leaders – motivated my involvement and board membership with 
Junior Achievement of Greater Cleveland.
 love helping kids begin to see how values such as integrity, respect, innovation, and customer focus influence a company’s standing in the marketplace.

Download a Short Bio
Born on a Air Force base in Nebraska, raised in Biloxi, Mississippi, educated in Okinawa, Japan, grew up as a multicultural kid in a multicultural environment. No surprise that my professional life would be multicultural too.
was always interested in science and technology – particularly chemistry – and how people used it or how businesses made it useful. So, after graduating from Michigan Technological University with a chemical engineering degree, joined Shell Chemical as a technical sales representative.
In addition to selling resins to adhesives, paints, and coatings, began helping customers develop new applications. One was a spray-up molding for airfoils on trucks. My customer was having shrinkage problems with polyester molding, so helped them switch to epoxy. Soon after, began helping with larger, more complex applications, such as aerospace and transportation composites.
Although was young and just learning how to sell, knew liked helping customers solve problems and creating value for them. enjoyed thinking about new and novel ways of helping them get things done. At the time, didn’t realize that it was my introduction to marketing.
Years later, after earning an and a master’s in Asian studies (to learn more about business in my mother’s native Japan), joined Arthur Little as a global management consultant. My work included operational diagnostics and improvements, segmentation, portfolio management, and valuation for mergers and acquisitions. For one project, spent a year in Korea, working with two large petrochemical companies, learning their business practices and doing valuations to prepare them to merge.
It was a good experience for my time later at Grace, where participated in acquisitions. That work took me around the world to China, Thailand, Japan, Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico, Germany, Spain, Russia …. Eventually, helped the acquire three businesses globally.
left my business development role to serve as global marketing director of the company’s packaging technologies division. It was my first marketing leadership position, and it reinforced the importance of customer focus. According to can and bottle manufacturers (our direct customers), we were in the sealants business. But according to beverage brand owners (our indirect customers), we were in the “taste control” business. And, ultimately, brand owners were the decision makers. To be “taste neutral” and to ensure beverages stayed “fresh tasting,” we made product and process improvements. That not only secured our relationship with brand owners but also positioned us to enter adjacent markets.
Some may call it marketing, but fundamentally it was the same thing I’d always done: study applications and figure out how my business or products could add more value for customers.
That’s what do today as vice president of marketing at Swagelok. want to lead our sales and marketing teams to look deeper into our customers and their applications and find new ways to provide value for them – and then focus on the industries and technical challenges that fit best with our values and capabilities. We need to constantly push the boundaries and provide better products that take customers where they need to go.
The role of marketing is making connections – between need and solution, and between supplier, distributor, and customer – so we all win together.

Download a Short Bio
My dad always encouraged me to look outside of the family business—a plumbing contracting company—to see what could accomplish on my own. By the time was in high school, had a serious girlfriend who would later become my wife, so had a practical reason for choosing a stable profession.
attended John Carroll University, and when took my first accounting class, decided to pursue a career in the field. While in college, worked at a small firm close to the school. We did tax work for a lot of small companies—mostly pizza shops. would do the business work, and the partners would do the individual tax work for the owners. That experience gave me a good base, helped me get my arms around the business, and reinforced that accounting was what wanted to do.
After graduation, joined Ernst & Young and held various positions in the auditing and tax departments during my nine years with the company. My work at E&helped me develop a clear thinking style. learned to envision the optimal outcome, and then determine the steps needed to take to reach the desired conclusion. That clarity of thought has proved beneficial throughout my career. was also lucky to work with really good people—good partners and good clients, including Swagelok.
In 1993, one of the partners at E&told me that wanted to talk to me about coming on board to start a tax department. had only one interview with Swagelok. It was a two-hour interview with Mr. Fred Lennon, the company’s founder. He focused on personal aspects—asking me about growing up and family. He talked about his philosophy and some of the management team at the time. It was a very interesting interview.
Joining was an easy decision. had that “it” factor, and “it” was the people. Being a consultant, had seen the financials and knew how successful the was, but there was something about the people that made me feel good. What didn’t know is that when fully came on board, it would be even better than imagined.
So joined as director of tax. started a tax function at the and learned that reviewing the company’s tax work was much different than figuring out the systems, getting the records together, and making it all work. had one person to help me, and taught her to do our consolidated tax return. We made it work.
Over the years, I’ve taken on more and broader responsibilities. was appointed treasurer in 1999 and promoted to in 2000. In 2012, was named executive vice president, finance and administration, and am responsible for overseeing the financial, customer service, supply chain, legal, global sourcing and logistics, and information technology functions of the organization.
I’ve always considered myself a fiduciary for the company, and take my responsibilities seriously. am always looking at what is best for the business overall, and hope that people who have worked with me would say they learned from me.
Outside of Swagelok, enjoy helping others through my participation on several boards, including Cleveland Central Catholic High School. It’s an inner city school whose students are nearly all at the poverty level, yet almost 90% of graduates go to college. The school saves lives, basically. We led a capital campaign and saw all of the goals—including adding classroom space and a football stadium—come to fruition. It’s a great story.
am also a member of the Ohio Society of CPAs, the Northeast Ohio Alumni Advisory Council for Ernst & Young, the Cleveland Advisory Board of Global, the Conrad Companies Board of Advisors, the Advisory Board of Inc. and the Advisory Board.

feel fortunate to have grown up in a family that valued work ethic, honesty, integrity, and treating people right. think that foundation is what made feel like home for me from the first day.
When took a job as a machine operator at a small facility, assumed it would be a temporary position.  After all, was finishing up my degree in education for the multiple handicapped. But had just completed my student teaching, and the experience was not what had envisioned. In fact, was a little disillusioned and was thinking about changing to a different education discipline. So while was running a chucker machine making hose ends, was also thinking about my future.
About two months into the job at Swagelok, was approached by a manager who knew was planning to go back to school. He told me that would pay for my education if switched majors. So kept my full-time job as a machine operator, went to school full-time at night, obtained a degree in business/finance, and began my career at Swagelok.
Swagelok’s commitment to education, training, and development has taught me the importance of being a life-long learner. There are so many opportunities available, but you have to be willing to grow and try new things—and I’ve done just that throughout my career.  
moved into supervision early on and was later asked to take on the role of building superintendent. loved being so connected to our products. In fact, one of things like most about is that we make things that are tangible. Years after we are personally gone, our products will still be here, and there is a certain sense of pride or accomplishment when it comes to watching product flow out the door.
was then asked to lead a project to realign Swagelok’s manufacturing footprint. It was a fabulous opportunity to learn about every part of as we conducted assessments to understand how we could optimize product flow or footprint. This work was a precursor to building our order fulfillment center and developing our Highland campus, and was fortunate to be a member of those project teams as a result.
This experience led to my first big promotion, which was becoming manager of corporate facilities and risk management. knew it would be a challenging transition from the operations side of the business to a more esoteric area, but it was a chance for me to show how quickly could learn. The risk component was really interesting and fun to learn about, and corporate facilities work fit into my passion for building things. Once again, ended up loving what was doing and was later promoted to director. 
Around this same time, was asked to lead an initiative to assess a we acquired on the Isle of Man; we needed to determine which products should continue to be manufactured there and which products should be moved to Solon. This project was probably one of the toughest for me because it was very emotional for the people involved, but it gave me a healthy respect for the role of corporate communications. For the project to be successful, it was critical for associates to understand that the restructuring was not only important to Swagelok, but also to the associates on the Isle of Man. We wanted to make sure we were putting them in the best possible position to succeed while integrating them into our culture and our policies.  I’m proud of the work did to articulate that vision to associates, get alignment, and move the initiative forward. 
then moved into my first customer-facing role as a director in customer service. Once again, knew had an opportunity to learn more, and did. Everything that is right with can be found in that department: the enthusiasm, the commitment to the customer, the desire to do what’s right. Our associates’ passion is infectious, and have to admit get a lot of energy from that kind of lively environment.
The next step in my journey came as a bit of surprise: was named treasurer. The opportunity dovetailed nicely with finishing the executive program at Case Western Reserve University. Still, the responsibilities seemed a bit overwhelming at first. There was a lot to learn and do, including establishing relationships and credibility with our vendors and money managers, plus a fair amount of academic learning. But then stopped to think about where was. Every time had transitioned, was surrounded by people who helped me succeed. The people at are committed to one another, and in this environment, you are almost destined to succeed.
Now, in my role as vice president, corporate communications, I’m focused on the clarity of our messages—both to our associates and to our customers—because communications is just as important for increasing associate engagement as it is to moving our brand forward. I’m also excited about continuing to integrate communications with the business to ensure consistent messaging, as well as to executing on our digital strategy to interact with our customers in new ways.
Outside of work, enjoy spending time with my wife and two daughters, as well as giving back to the community. think it’s important that we remind ourselves that we are a part of something bigger, and serving on non-profit boards is one way to make an impact. After seven years, recently rotated off the 
 Board, which is a non-profit that employs disabled people, and joined the 
 Board. I’m passionate about their work with the underserved community, as well as their Level 1 Trauma Center and burn unit that provide key services to badly injured people. am also a member of the Foundation Board.

always had a pretty good head for business – even in high school and early college, when managed a Carvel ice cream parlor in Brooklyn, Knowing the customer was key to that operation, just like at today. So was knowing how to treat customers and employees. And being responsible with finances. And making sure processes followed standards, to maintain quality.
In 1980, earned a degree in economics and accounting from the City University of New York. got offers from a few firms, but felt most comfortable with the gentler, Midwestern values of Ernst & Ernst. They hired me as an entry-level accountant in their small New York office. By age 24, transferred to the firm’s headquarters in Cleveland where had exposure to more senior leaders.
worked my way up the ranks, dealing with all kinds of interesting client companies. was always the guy willing to take on a new adventure, a new assignment. In addition to tax work, handled initial public offerings, due diligence, mergers and acquisitions, and more.
Eventually, ran a regional financial services practice for what was then called Ernst & Young. group of 100-some people, we served major banks, investment companies and manufacturing companies around Cleveland, Toledo and Detroit.
Soon after, became a partner in the firm, one of my proudest accomplishments.
By 1998, was ready for something new – some exposure to disciplines outside accounting and finance. gave me the opportunity, inviting me to become chief financial officer.
came on board and took over Swagelok’s finance and areas, but also was encouraged to get involved in even more: manufacturing, marketing, supply chain, In 2000, helped ramp up Swagelok’s business in the semiconductor industry, particularly with supply chain planning. worked with to put in a new system to better allocate products and better understand customer demand.
was so focused on trying to do a good job as CFO, that didn’t expect to be named president and chief operating officer one year later. In 2003, became chief executive officer.
One of my biggest successes as has been picking a good team – one that shows the respect and integrity so important to this company. Here, it’s not only what you do, but how you do it.
With their help, I’ve seen become better at listening to customers and offering them custom solutions. We’ve become more nimble, adopting lean manufacturing principles – because it’s the right, responsible thing to do.
try to instill in my leaders a devotion to service, rather than a devotion to self. That’s helped become as strong as it is today. And it’s helped make us a good corporate citizen. Everyone on our management team gives back to the community by serving outside Swagelok.

My grandfather and my dad were two tremendous influences who impacted my choice of career pathways early on.  will always have fond memories of working with my grandfather in his wood-working shop.  He loved to create and build with his hands, and he passed that love down to me.  From my dad, learned the value of hard work and the importance of loving what you do.  My dad’s career led to us moving around quite a bit; through it all watched him balance his passion for work and love of family.
Even though I’ve lived in other places—Montreal, Detroit, South Carolina, Florida, and Washington D.C.—I’ve always considered Cleveland my home. In fact, think my Cleveland roots are one of the biggest influences in what do today.
As a kid, enjoyed sports, both as a participant and as a spectator. My family and were big Cleveland Browns fans, and some of my best memories are going to Browns games with my grandfather who was a season ticket holder since the 1960s. I’m still a fan today, and take my sons to the games now. Being a Cleveland sports fan makes you tough; it requires a lot of optimism and tremendous loyalty.
When graduated from Miami University with an engineering degree, joined Price Waterhouse as an consultant. The opportunity to travel and work with different clients was a great experience out of college. From there, worked as a contractor for a number of clients who were augmenting their teams.  Eventually, joined an Internet start-up in Alexandria, VA, right outside of Washington D.C. 
My time with the start-up was an amazing experience because had to wear so many hats in order to build something from the ground up and make it profitable. It was also my first real cut at leadership, managing the website development team. The climb to profitability had many bumps along the way, requiring me to learn quickly and adapt to new situations.
Although enjoyed what was doing, had a growing desire to get into manufacturing in order to lead bigger teams, solve complex problems, and be part of making something tangible.  short while later, the time seemed right to change careers.  The first step was attending Case Western Reserve University full-time, and graduated with my in 2006. This move also enabled me to move my growing family to Cleveland.
was fortunate to connect with after graduating and began my career as a business analyst in the corporate raw materials warehouse. gained leadership experience as a scheduling supervisor and shop floor supervisor before moving into managerial positions in planning, operations, and engineering within the organization’s fitting services group.
Then was presented with a significant stretch opportunity when was promoted to a director position in It was so different from the operations side of the business. learned a lot about a much different aspect of the organization and was challenged to adapt my style as a leader during those 18 months. had a new perspective when returned to operations as a director of the fitting services group.
has provided me with so many opportunities to work with talented people, learn from great leaders, and put my own leadership skills to use. I’ve had the chance to build strong working relationships across the organization and to develop strong teams. All of these experiences have prepared me for my current role as vice president, global sourcing and logistics.
The purchase and supply of material, components, and services are critical to what we do each day and to the value we provide to our customers. If you think about the responsibility of the global sourcing and logistics team, it’s to mitigate any supply chain risk and enable value through our supply chain. We have to make sure that we have a talented team leveraging robust processes to enable results through our supplier relationships.
Outside of work, enjoy spending time with my family in their many activities. am also proud to serve on the board of a non-profit called 
, whose mission is to empower individuals to gain and maintain employment. Being able to help people develop basic job skills and establish careers so that they can take care of themselves and their families is rewarding. I’m proud of Cleveland, and like being a part of making it better.

Download a Short Bio
Working at a carwash as a kid one summer taught me so much about serving customers. Every customer was different. Some were quiet; some would talk your ear off. Some voiced complaints; others were pressed for time. Engaging with customers from all walks of life back then produced early lessons about the art of communication and listening. enjoyed the challenge of providing a memorable customer experience, no matter how challenging the situation.
Majoring in management information systems at the University of Dayton served and expanded my interests in computer science and working with people. As programmer for a Dayton-based retailer, coded systems for purchase-order processing and accounts payable. Writing security software for a VC-funded accelerated my understanding of sales cycles and pricing. It provided insight into the realities of running a small business and prepared me for a move into financial services. For five years, worked in Bank One’s electronic banking group, writing software that let retailers authorize and credit card transactions. The experience exposed me to the banking industry and the challenges of acquiring other financial institutions.
In time, found myself wanting greater involvement in the development and definition of business requirements – not just required programming. An opportunity with Ernst & Young’s consulting business offered a fitting new challenge. One of my biggest projects at E&was helping KeyCorp implement a new database of customer information so they could understand and serve customers better. This work taught me the importance of integrity in building strong relationships and influencing people. Similar to my experience at Bank One, these years were marked by the support of mentors and colleagues who truly cared about my development.
When learned about Swagelok, the company’s focus on customers and integrity stood out immediately. Every associate that met was consistent about doing the right thing. Upon joining Swagelok, was able to leverage my technology background while taking every opportunity to understand the challenges of a global manufacturing company. first served in three information systems roles, including My desire to help get closer to customers – to demonstrate a passion for customers – led to my assignment as vice president, customer service and supply chain. didn’t grow up in these critical functions, so it was an opportunity to learn and grow. Our teams always sought to listen intently to better understand and serve customers.
Today serve as vice president, distributor support services, a function that connects distributors and customers to the factory. Our team is committed to listening and understanding the challenges facing our distributor network. Under One Swagelok, insights will be shared and actions taken to drive the overall customer experience to new and higher levels by leveraging our local and global capabilities.

Download a Short Bio
The values that my parents and mentors instilled in me as grew up—the importance of hard work…always doing your best…challenging yourself to go a little further…helping and encouraging others—guide me to this day.
My parents used work opportunities to teach my two brothers, sister and me life lessons. Our responsibilities included maintaining the family garden, cutting the lawn and other household jobs. We even worked with our dad as a lawn maintenance crew at area Columbia Gas locations—a little side business he started in addition to working fulltime for the company. Along the way, also had a paper route and when was in high school, worked at my mom’s restaurant. These early experiences built the foundation of who am today.
After seeing the high price my parents were paying for my dorm at Akron University, convinced them to cosign on the purchase of near-campus house letting them know that had four guys ready to move in and pay rent. That experience taught me a lot about budgeting, marketing and communicating well with many different kinds of people.
During college also interned at Swagelok. The environment was outstanding and met great people. Right before graduated, landed a job conducting intake interviews with Swagelok’s human resources. After about a month on the job, founder Fred Lennon stopped by my desk. He said, “You have a very important position with us, Dave. You’re the first touch point with people looking for a job at our and our associates are a very important asset. want you to know how vital your role is here.” From there on, knew was the right place for me.
Throughout my career at Swagelok, I’ve had many great opportunities to grow. One of the most challenging and rewarding was leading our Business Systems Transformation (BST) program which redesigned business processes and combined several of our legacy business systems into one. The personal accomplishment felt was tremendous and it was exciting to see how the effort transformed associates on the team—how they advanced their abilities and evolved with the program. Hopefully, my leadership helped encourage that growth.
In my current role, I’m applying all the good lessons I’ve learned along the way. These include making sure we have the right processes in place, challenging associates to be accountable for their efforts and push to grow their skills, employing a straightforward approach to reach goals and always looking at best practices. 
Well over half of what we do in Information Services (IS) is making sure the systems are available for the business. We call this “protecting the core” which means the servers have to operate efficiently and the networks have to keep running. Having a very structured, standard work mindset is necessary. But at the same point, technology moves so fast, we can’t just bury our heads and say we’re going to keep doing it this way. It changes all the time. So while process is important, it’s equally important for us to have the vision of the future and know the big picture. The path to success is taking simple steps—focusing on the next one-to-three things that move us in the right direction.
At the end of the day, get a lot of satisfaction out of my work and helping others reach personal and professional goals. And try to pass on those great values that my parents and mentors have taught me—to my fellow associates, my family and through my efforts as a board member at

Download a Short Bio
I’m naturally curious and always want to know more, and think those characteristics have served me well in my career. Tell me more, tell me what you’ve done, tell me how we could do it differently. love to hear new ideas and to dig deep, and I’m passionate about our work in corporate communications. 
For as long as can remember, wanted to be a writer. Specifically, wanted to be a journalist—asking questions and learning more. Because also loved sports, planned on becoming a sports journalist. In fact, was sports editor for John Carroll University’s newspaper for a time.
During my junior year of college, however, started an internship at St. Vincent Charity Hospital in downtown Cleveland. While working for the director of public relations and communications, fell in love with the profession. loved being inside a business and working to tell its story—not only to the outside world, but also to the patients, doctors, nurses, and everyone who made the hospital run. relied on my natural curiosity and my writing ability to develop research proposals, coordinate events, and handle media relations. It was truly a phenomenal hands-on experience that led me on a new career path.
When graduated, accepted a job with a public relations agency, who had worked with at the hospital.  knew this opportunity would give me a broad base of experience, and it did. did plenty of writing and learned the importance of client services. used the investigational skills that learned in my journalism classes to get to know the clients and their challenges and used that information to create new solutions for them.
But didn’t know that working at the agency would lead me to the next “aha moment” on my career path. It was here that fell in love with business-to-business communications. The opportunity to get in, ask questions, and understand a manufacturing environment energized me. Knowing that could take what learned and make it real through storytelling, marketing materials, and events—it was like a whole new world had opened to me.
My love for the b-to-b world brought me to as a writer and senior public relations specialist in 2007. was entrusted with so many wonderful opportunities that helped me learn and grow. One of the most memorable was helping apply for—and ultimately win—Industry Week’s Best Plant Award. There’s not one part of the organization that the application doesn’t ask you to represent, so was literally set loose to network and gather information across the organization. It was the perfect assignment for someone who wanted to know more, and learned so much. And it was so exciting when we won—it was such a moment for all associates to see that we are one of the top ten plants in North America. It was amazing to be a part of that process.
I’ve been fortunate to have opportunities to explore various aspects of the communications function—live events, marketing communications, corporate communications, and global brand strategy. We’ve done a lot of good foundational work to create a positive associate engagement experience, our digital experience is on track, and the customer experience is emerging. Now, we have an opportunity to ask questions and consider how these experiences converge. I’m excited to share my passion with the team so that we can all move forward together and take our good work to the next level.
is a community anchor for manufacturing in this area, and as a member of the Foundation, I’m excited to be involved in supporting the community. also see an opportunity to tell more of Swagelok’s story. My vision is for our community and our customers to know Swagelok—and to want to know even more. 
Outside of work, enjoy reading, sewing, and most of all, spending time with my family. have a wonderful husband, Steve, and two children, a daughter and a son. don’t think you can excel in a career—let alone advance—if you don’t have a supportive partner. And Steve is truly a partner.

Giving Back to Our Communities
As a company, we continue to increase our involvement with local charities and boards. provides support to organizations such as Harvest for Hunger, Susan Komen®, and Habitat for Humanity®. Our charitable foundations and trusts support local charities with $5 million in annual donations.
On an individual and group basis, our associates provide countless volunteer hours and other means of support to a wide variety of causes. Our sales and service centers have a strong community focus and are active in improving the regions in which they operate.
Reducing Energy Use and Waste
Although our manufacturing output has increased significantly since 2010, our level of energy use has remained virtually the same. Recent investments in our facilities have included new lighting, air compressors, boilers, chillers, and other more energy-efficient equipment.
We minimize our use of hazardous chemicals by seeking safer chemicals and other materials for our manufacturing processes and products. Each year at our facilities, we recycle more than 15-million lbs. of alloys, and we divert more than 50% of general waste from landfills.
Outside our facilities, we have planted gardens of wildflowers and native prairie grass to reduce fertilizer use and emissions from mowers.

Download a Short Bio
grew up in our family business of running service stations and actually ran a Sunoco station during college. While pumping gas, checking oil and washing windows, learned the details of running a business. learned how to serve customers, standing face-to-face with them.
But knew my future wasn't in service stations. In 1985, earned a degree in computer science and got hired at as a programmer in the distributor systems area. With my service background, distributors’ jobs resonated with me. As gained experience, discovered what liked most, though, was being part of projects — using information systems (IS) to move the business forward.
After getting my in 2000, was ready for a challenge outside the computer center: director of distribution and logistics.
For six years, led distribution centers in the U.S., Japan, Europe and Australia. Soon, my group combined with the factory customer service group. That’s when helped start the World-Class Customer Service Programs like the Service Summit. For the Service Summit, we invited distributor staff for a week long visit to our factory — then sent our staff out to visit distributorships. Everyone learned what life was like at the other end of the phone. Kind of a face-to-face customer service lesson, like at the service station. still does it today.
Then the got a big idea: building a new Order Fulfillment Center where most of our inventory and assembly people would work together. From 2004 to 2006, led that program, the largest one had ever done. 
For that work, earned a Kerzner Award for Project Management Excellence. The award is in my office, but more important to me is the picture right next to it: the picture of our program team. 
Then and now, people are my focus. know if they’re happy personally, they’ll do their best. “Listen, Learn, Help and Lead” is a phrase that picked up years ago. It still holds true for me today. Listen with the intent of learning, and learn with the intent of helping.
Leading project teams is what love doing. If somebody said, “Here are the five toughest projects critical for the company,” I’d take all five, get a team and get them done. love working with other people, helping them solve problems and accomplishing big things. It’s a great way to be involved in moving the forward.
Leading Swagelok’s Business System Transformation (BST) was another great opportunity to help the company. This initiative established a foundation for operational excellence in process and systems. Today, our work continues to make a significant difference in how we satisfy our customers. And that’s very rewarding. 
Currently, ensuring has a healthy supply chain and is providing world class service are key responsibilities. When customers need our products and services, we need to provide them as promised. What’s more, when customers need additional help, we need to be there for them. Swagelok’s supply chain and service systems help us deliver the quality, innovation and other 
While always want my teams to get the “Super Bowl ring,” thirty years in martial arts have taught me that you can’t control winning and losing. You 
 control effort and attitude, though, and that’s what drives continuous improvement. “Every day, a little better.” focus on that with black belts as well as myself and my teams—and to those involved with the

Developing Innovative Products and Services
Throughout Swagelok’s history, our engineering teams have developed high-quality products, processes, and services designed to meet the evolving needs of our customers.
Over the last several years, we’ve worked to deepen our understanding of our customers’ needs and develop innovative solutions to meet them each step of the way. In addition to gathering regular feedback from our Analytical Instrumentation Customer Advisory Board, we have expanded our innovation, technology, and field engineering teams, are leveraging new ways of connecting with customers, and have further incorporated innovation into our daily operations.
As part of our innovation initiative, we invested in an in-house makerspace where associates can collaborate with peers from around the organization to create new ideas, quickly take new ideas to concept, and physically produce prototypes. We also invested in an online crowdsourcing tool – we call it ideaspace – to boost our ability to collaborate across the global organization and speed the identification of viable solutions to significant business challenges. 
Customer-Focused Solutions
Our grab sampling solution, developed after years of experience in helping customers troubleshoot existing assemblies, allows chemical plants and refineries to confidently configure and order local assemblies that address their pressing needs.
We also developed a quick qualification or “Quick Qual” process specifically for OEMs in the semiconductor industry that needed customized products in a short period of time. Multiple teams work in parallel to design, test, and manufacture a prototype product in two to four weeks instead of the traditional eight to 10 weeks. In the semiconductor industry, speed to market is essential to success, and we are helping customers get there faster.
Capital Projects is dedicated exclusively to managing global coordination and all of the related issues for new construction projects around the world.
