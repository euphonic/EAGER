is the principal teaching hospital of University School of Medicine.
Floating Hospital for Children is the full-service children's hospital of Center. 
New England Quality Care Alliance is the award winning, not for profit, physician network of Center.
History of Center's proud and distinguished tradition began in 1796, when a group of public-spirited Bostonians, including patriots Paul Revere and Samuel Adams, established the Boston Dispensary as the third permanent facility in the country and the first New England. The Dispensary’s founders funded tickets that enabled the city's poor to receive care; one of the original tickets signed by Revere can still be seen today at the Massachusetts Historical Society.
Providing care for the poor
Using the Bible’s “Good Samaritan” parable as its model, the Dispensary grew rapidly and continued to find new and innovative ways to care for the city’s underserved working and poor population. Some of the more notable innovations included: having volunteer doctors and nurses provide free visits to district residents that needed care; creating dental and nutrition clinics; and most famously, starting an evening clinic that was partially employer funded and was designed to treat the city’s “working poor.” The Boston Dispensary provided high-quality, patient-centered care, pioneering many new therapies and health care delivery improvements. It was the first to initiate a number of practices that are now commonplace today.
Emerging partnerships
Over the ensuing years, the Boston Dispensary developed mutually beneficial affiliations with a number of compatible institutions, most notably, its partnership with the Boston Floating Hospital for Children (New England’s first pediatric hospital) in 1930. At about the same time, the Dispensary became the primary teaching hospital for University’s and Dental schools. Then, in 1946, the 100-bed Pratt Diagnostic Clinic, the world’s largest clinic of its kind at the time of its opening, joined the partnership as well. In 1968, this set of affiliations was formerly organized as New England Center; in 2008, the name was shortened to Center, to better reflect the hospital’s close relationship with University.
Tradition of world-class care and research continued today
The current-day campus remains in the downtown Boston neighborhood where the original Boston Dispensary was founded over 200 years ago. is proud of its leadership role in America’s development of modern medicine. It continues to be molded by its historic mission, never losing the perspective of being a community based, world class adult and pediatric teaching and research hospital. It remains true to its mission statement which reads in part: “We dedicate ourselves to furthering our rich tradition of health care innovation, leadership, charity and the highest standard of care and service to all in our community.”

Groundbreaking Research That Touches Every Stage of Life
(MC) and Floating Hospital for Children provide care for patients through infancy and childhood and into adulthood. This dedication to exceptional adult and pediatric care also inspires and drives our research: our institutes and centers continuously explore and develop new and advanced diagnostics, therapies and methods that touch people in every stage of their lives.
Research Leadership in Boston — and on the National Stage
Research at and Floating Hospital for Children stands out, even in a national hub of medicine like Boston. few of our many achievements include:
studies have led to the discovery of drugs that prevent the body’s rejection of transplanted organs, coining the term "immunosuppression,” and Illuminated the link between obesity and heart disease.
We rank in the top 10 percent of all institutions receiving National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding.
MC's Molecular Cardiology Research Institute (MCRI) scientists are exploring sex differences in cardiovascular disease, aging-associated high blood pressure, signaling pathways within the heart muscle relevant to heart failure, and developing and evaluating circulatory-support devices. 
The Mother Infant Research Institute focuses on improving the health of pregnant women and their children and also is home to one of the world’s most respected sub-specialty journals, Prenatal Diagnosis.
researchers, supported by a five-year, $40 million grant, are leading a large, multi-trial to study whether vitamin can stop pre-diabetes from progressing to diabetes.

Our Mission: to Help People Lead Healthy, Fulfilling Lives
The common thread tying together all of our research is patient well-being. While a number of our programs and clinical studies are born in the imaginations of our investigators, many of our efforts begin with a patient’s or parent’s question: Will able to walk on my own again? Will my daughter be able to go back to school?
For more than 200 years, our researchers have made a difference by relentlessly pursuing the answers to questions like these, and they will leave no stone unturned to help people today — and future generations —  enjoy the healthiest lives possible.

Thinking ahead for patients in need of a complex brain surgery
An awake craniotomy, or brain surgery while the patient is awake, is not your everyday procedure. That is, unless you are Penny Liu, , the Director of Neurosurgical Anesthesia  at Center. Dr. Liu works in a pre-operation clinic that prepares patients for their awake craniotomy.
Awake craniotomies are typically used to treat patients who have a lesion or brain tumor that has spread to what is said to be the “eloquent” areas of the brain, meaning that it is in a part of the brain that may affect speech, movement, or cognizance. 
Having the patient awake is the best way to monitor progress, says Dr. Liu. “We want them to be able to talk to us so that if they suddenly stop talking, have slurred speech, or can’t name an everyday object, we know we are in a dangerous area.”
step-by-step guide before the surgery
thinks ahead for patients by scheduling them to see Dr. Liu before their surgery. During the appointment Dr. Liu describes the surgery and what to expect. “want the patient to know exactly who is going to be working with them,” she said. “want all of those anxieties gone before the day of the surgery.” 
Dr. Liu is straightforward with her patients and describes each step of the surgery in detail. “want to be very honest with patients. need them to have the proper understanding of the surgery so that nothing comes up in the operating room that could prevent us from finishing,” explains Dr. Liu. Patients know what pictures they will be shown, what questions they will be asked, and most importantly, are familiarized with everybody that will be in the room with them. 
“We are the only people a patient will see during surgery” said Dr. Liu of herself and her colleagues. “They may hear their surgeon’s voice from behind them, but they see our faces the whole time. We get comfortable with each other.” Dr. Liu says that she has seen this practice truly pay off with her patients. If a patient is comfortable with their doctors ahead of time, they are more comfortable during the procedure. 
The art of caring for patients before, during and after surgery
The continuity of care that these patients feel is critical to this process, according to Dr. Liu. “We are not a part of that case unless we are there for the very first step,” she said. This includes, doctors, surgeons, and even anesthesiologists. “Sometimes, caring for patients is art,” said Dr. Liu. “The way you care for them, the way you treat them, this is entirely critical for our surgeries to be successful.”

The award recognizes as in the top 10 of participating academic centers nationwide, demonstrating superior quality and safety performance in more than 100 quality measures. The award was presented on Thursday, Oct. 4 during the 2018 Vizient Connections Summit held in Las Vegas.
“We are honored to receive this award and to be recognized as one of the very best academic centers in the U.S.,” said Deeb Salem, MD, Co-Interim at and Chair of the Department of Medicine. “This award is the result of outstanding effort day in and day out by our clinical and support staff which tirelessly and consistently put our patients first.” 
This year, 99 academic centers, 100 complex teaching centers and 93 community hospitals were included in the Vizient Quality and Accountability Study which has been conducted annually since 2005. Vizient’s study measures data for safety, timeliness, effectiveness, efficiency, equity and patient centeredness – 112 measures in total. The award is based on how well academic centers like are caring for patients, including their overall outcomes, surgical infection and mortality rates and readmissions. 
“This is an especially meaningful award because it looks at the measures that really matter in health care – the quality and safety of the care patients receive and the experience they have while receiving it,” said Terry Hudson-Jinks, RN, MSN, Co-Interim at and Senior Vice President of Patient Care Services. “Hospitals are under increasing pressure from consumers, employers, government and payers to rein in costs. At Center, everyone is on the care team and all have worked hard to improve efficiency while always thinking ahead to what our patients need next, ensuring the best clinical outcomes possible. This award shows our strategy is working.” 
has received five stars, Vizient’s top honor, twice before, most recently in 2015. is among an elite group of academic centers in the country, and the only one in New England, to earn five stars. Strong teamwork across MC’s entire organization propelled the to the top after scoring four stars in 2017, improving in seven of nine measurement categories including: reducing surgical site infections and central line associated bloodstream infections; reducing length of stay, improving mortality and surgical complications rates; preventing avoidable readmissions and preventing patients from returning to the emergency department within 30 days of discharge. Specifically, improved quality by partnering with post-acute care facilities, working with palliative care clinicians, ensuring that patients have filled prescriptions when they go home, and making follow up calls and appointments, especially for high-risk patients.  
The Vizient Quality and Accountability Study helps academic centers, complex teaching centers and community hospitals identify structures and processes associated with high performance in quality and safety across a broad spectrum of patient care activity. is honored to be 10th among the 11 top-performing academic centers, including Mayo Rochester, Rush University, Langone, University of Texas Galveston, University of Kansas, University of Pennsylvania, University of Utah Health, Houston Methodist, Memorial Hermann and Morristown.

Five stars for MC
At Center, we are Always Thinking Ahead. Five steps ahead, that is. 
 (formerly known as University HealthSystem Consortium) announced that earned its top award of five stars for quality and patient safety in its annual, national study. We are among the top 10 adult academic centers (AMCs), and the only one in New England, to receive five stars and the Bernard Birnbaum, MD, Quality Leadership Award, out of 99 AMCs from across the that participated in this year’s Vizient Quality and Accountability Study.
Teamwork for our patients
This achievement is due to the very hard work of all of our employees every day to improve how we are Always Thinking Ahead and caring for our patients and their families. Strong teamwork, reaching every level of our organization, propelled us to the top. The comprehensive Vizient study looks at data for safety, timeliness, effectiveness, efficiency, equity and patient centeredness—more than 100 measures in total, focused on adult patients. It is especially meaningful because this award compares us to other AMCs and is about getting all the parts of care right: quality, safety and patient experience.
Caring for our patients
The award is based on how well we care for patients and what type of outcomes patients seeking care with us have. The measures include surgical complications, length of stay and mortality rates, all of which are excellent, especially because we have a very high case mix index, meaning we do a terrific job of caring for very, very sick patients. Teams across and Floating Hospital work to document severity of illness, manage patient care, prevent avoidable readmissions, make sure data is flowing properly so it can be captured and keep an eye on all of the data so we can use it to continually improve, to name just a few.

and seven other trusted hospital brands joined forces today to require third-party vendors to adopt standard cyber security measures and achieve certification to demonstrate their products and services are safe and secure for use in a hospital or other patient care settings. Center, along with its Wellforce partners, and Cleveland Clinic, University of Florida Health, UPMC, Alleghany Health Network and University of Rochester have teamed up to collaboratively define, adopt, and promote standards for vendors whose equipment or services interact with patients and their personal information.  The group, named the Provider Third Party Risk Management Council, will begin requiring certification for these types of vendors within the next 24 months.  
“We have seen an increase in threats by cybercriminals, compromising the networks and systems purchased by hospitals through third parties.  As health information technology continues to move to the Cloud and the role of third parties grows, these threats will increase.  We must insist patients and their information is guarded under the best programs available,” said Taylor Lehmann, Chief Information Security Officer at Wellforce and Center.  “Through the Council and our third parties, we will build a more secure and safer healthcare system and one that will benefit every hospital and third party across the industry – regardless of their size or sophistication.” 
Most providers and hospital systems already use a set of information security standards when evaluating whether a third party is qualified to receive patient information. Those standards can range widely, and can lead to many hours or days of work on both sides as they try to come to an understanding of security protocols. Vendors often withstand many different evaluation processes between the health care systems they are looking to do business with.   The Council is looking to address that issue as well.
“Having all of the third parties who receive information about our patients get certified with the same framework means we can stop this waste, give our vendors a clear message on what is required, and improve our processes to investigate and monitor the security of any given platform,” said John Houston, Esq. and Chief Information Security Officer at , a Council member. “If a third party provides a certificate showing it has met these requirements, we are more assured that theirs is an acceptable product with no further verification needed.” 
Regulations and consumer expectations around protection of health records continue to change.  For example, nearly every state has different requirements when a data breach occurs. In addition, many states are adopting specific security and privacy rules which complement a myriad of existing federal laws. The complexity of the laws, regulations, and standards an organization needs to comply with are overwhelming. The Council has partnered with the Assurance Program , which provides guidance and is a certifying body, to guide vendors through this process.

Researchers receive award to integrate targeted genomic sequencing into neonatal diagnosis and care
researchers have received a five-year grant award for more than $8 million from the National For Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to study the integration of targeted genomic sequencing into neonatal diagnosis and care. Funding for the national clinical trial, “Precision Medicine in the Diagnosis of Genetic Disorders in Neonates,” begins today.
The first-of-its-kind, six-site Trial Innovation Network study will recruit 400 newborns with a wide variety of possible genetic disorders, but who were unable to receive a diagnosis using standard testing. Each infant will receive whole genome sequencing, as well as targeted genomic sequencing, which analyzes 1,722 genetic disorders known to affect newborns. The researchers will then compare the two approaches for accuracy and effectiveness in identifying genetic disorders, and determine whether the targeted panel, which is being developed in conjunction with Quest Diagnostics , can be safely integrated into newborn care. 
“When a newborn’s entire genome is sequenced, unintended information may be learned, including potential issues that could affect the child later in life,” said Jill Maron, , Executive Director of the Mother Infant Research Institute  at Floating Hospital for Children at Center, Vice Chair of Pediatric Research at Floating Hospital and Co-Principal Investigator of the study. “Since the targeted panel only screens for genetic disorders that appear in the newborn stage and can be addressed immediately, its use would eliminate any ethical dilemmas for physicians and avoid burdening families with information on adult onset diseases they may not want to know about.”
The study also will conduct statistical and health economic analyses to determine if, and how much, targeted genomic testing would save the health care system if it is integrated into newborn care. Since targeted screening is much less costly than sequencing the whole genome, there is potential for substantial health savings and a new, improved standard of care.
“This study is a unique opportunity to dramatically improve outcomes for newborns with a genetic disorder by drastically speeding up the time to a diagnosis and treatment, while simultaneously lowering the cost of care,” said Jonathan Davis, , Chief of Newborn Medicine  at Floating Hospital for Children at and Co-Principal Investigator of the study. “We hope this innovative precision medicine approach to diagnosis and treatment of fragile newborns allows us to care for these infants in a faster, cheaper and better way.”

The Massachusetts Health & Hospital Association (MHA) and Center, working with hospital clinicians and operational staff in Massachusetts and other states, have developed two documents to help hospitals develop internal policies to prevent opioid misuse by patients admitted for care and treatment. The new Inpatient Opioid Misuse Prevention Guidelines and Patient and Family Agreement on Opioids are now available on MHA’s PatientCareLink website.
Current opioid epidemic
“Our nation’s opioid epidemic has become the great equalizer. No zip code, no income level, no background, is immune from its devastating reach. It will take all of our best and collective efforts to solve this complex problem that has already taken far too many lives. Hospitals on the front lines of this battle are committed to using our resources and expertise to develop and effect solutions.  We’ve led the way on implementing prescription limits, which is beginning to make a significant difference in reducing access to opioids,” said Steve Walsh, President & of “We are gravely concerned knowing that addicted patients bring heroin or non-prescribed opioids with them to the hospital, or try to obtain illegal drugs during their stay.  Today, we announce a new component in our initiative to prevent unlawful and dangerous opioid use within hospitals. We are working in tandem with our member hospitals and other concerned groups to launch inpatient guidelines and a patient/family agreement to provide a first-in-the-nation, comprehensive, statewide framework to screen, manage, and treat patients with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) .”
“How we manage this epidemic inside our hospitals is of utmost importance. Hospitalized individuals with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) are at increased risk of leaving against advice, suffering painful withdrawal symptoms, and dying from an overdose post-discharge if their tolerance for opioids goes down during hospitalization,” said Deeb Salem, , co-interim and chair of the Department of Medicine at University School of Medicine. Dr. Salem co-authored the documents with Steven Defossez, MD, MHA’s Vice President for Clinical Integration, 
University School of Medicine student Ifeanyi Chinedozi, and University student Megan Fernandez, now at University of Massachusetts School.
“We want to assist hospital-based clinicians to care for patients with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) with both evidence-based best practices and compassion,” Dr. Defossez said. 
The Inpatient Opioid Misuse Prevention Guidelines identify best practices (clinical practices and operational policies) to optimize patient care. These include specific instructions regarding:
Screening for opioid use disorder among patients admitted for inpatient level care;
Prevention of inpatient acute opioid withdrawal through medication assisted therapy;
Prevention of and response to an opioid overdose ;
Management of acute pain in the setting of chronic opioid use;
Preventing patients from bringing opioids into a hospital ;
Working with visitors to prevent inappropriate opioid use or bringing in opioids during visitation;
Educating patients on the risks of opioid misuse;
Care coordination for patients refusing to follow zero-tolerance of opioid misuse.
The Patient and Family Agreement on Opioids was written specifically for patients, families, and visitors. It states that the care team is committed to the patient’s recovery and wellness, and that facilities offer patients options to assist them on their road to recovery.  This includes medications to keep them from going into withdrawal while they are hospitalized as well as assistance in finding available services following their discharge, if they so choose. The document also spells out the obligations of a patient’s family and visitors to help achieve this goal, including a patient-centered zero tolerance for inpatient opioid misuse. Included in the document are a template consent form for the patient to sign and a separate template consent form for family members and visitors of patients suffering from 
The latest opioid guidance builds on efforts from and the hospital community to curb the opioid crisis. Previously, convened a task force that included a multi-disciplinary group of clinicians and operational staff to develop and issue an array of guidance and informational sheets to help improve opioid prescribing practices within hospitals.  The materials also provide standards for screening patients seeking opioid prescriptions, offer information on appropriate pain management and treatment, and help identify resources for patients needing substance use disorder treatment. The materials include patient and provider fact sheets about the risk and harm of opioids, suggestions for the proper storage and disposal of opioids, and suggestions on improving internal education of clinicians to help them limit and find alternatives to using opioid pain medications.   All of these materials, as well as this recent set of guidance documents, are available on the MHA’s PatientCareLink website .

Neurosurgeons at are now using a laser to destroy abnormal brain tissue that causes seizures.
The procedure, called Stereotactic Laser Interstitial Thermal Therapy (LITT) uses intense light energy to heat and eliminate areas of the brain that set off seizures.  Surgeons use real time guided technology to pinpoint the precise brain tissue that needs the treatment, leaving surrounding tissue unharmed.
“This new technique will shift the way we treat seizures,” said James Kryzanski, , Chief of the Division of Epilepsy Surgery at Center. “It is minimally invasive and incredibly precise, which translates to better outcomes for our patients.”
This approach has many benefits compared to the current gold standard surgical procedure - Anterior Temporal Lobectomy (ATL), Dr. Kryzanski explained. is an open surgical procedure involving a large incision and the removal of part of the Anterior Temporal Lobe. With The newer procedure, the imaging allows surgeons to locate the exact area of tissue with a small incision and tiny fiber probe. The result is fewer complications and quicker recovery. Patients also experience less pain.
Studies suggest that the effectiveness of the newer procedure is comparable to open surgery with at least half of patients who undergo Stereotactic Laser Therapy experiencing complete freedom from seizures over time.
About one percent of the population is affected by epilepsy, and about one-third of those patients are unable to control seizures with current medications.
“For many of those who have uncontrolled seizures, this new procedure will be life-changing,” noted Dr. Kryzanski.
To contact the Epilepsy at Center, call 617-636-5848.

On June 6, 2018, reached a landmark milestone in cardiac transplantation when cardiac surgeons, led by Senior Cardiothoracic Surgeon Hassan Rastegar, , performed the 500th heart transplant at (see photo on left). The patient, Frank Lalli, 61, from Portsmouth, RI, is recovering well from the procedure.
About the 500th heart transplant
“am proud to have been a part of the team that was present during the first-ever heart transplant at in 1985,” said Deeb Salem, , Co-Interim at (see photo below). “The program has grown exponentially in 33 years and now represents the gold standard for cardiac transplantation in all of New England. It is extremely gratifying to have attained this level of excellence and reaching this milestone only further validates our heart transplant program’s standing among the very best in the country.”
“None of these heart transplants would  have been possible without the generosity of the donor family, the organization, speed and collaboration of the New England Organ Bank and the dedication and flexibility of the entire team,” said Gregory Couper, , Surgical Director of the Advanced Heart Failure Program  at Center. “It takes all these people working together skillfully, efficiently and expediently to perform a heart transplant. The fact that our program now has accomplished this objective 500 times is truly an affirmation of the outstanding efforts of the countless people who made it possible for more than three decades.”
History of heart transplants at MC
Since the year 2000, has performed the most heart transplants in New England (405), more than 50 more than any other hospital in the region. In 2016, completed 56 heart transplants, a New England record that ranked among the top-10 heart transplant programs in the country for volume. According to the most recent Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients (SRTR) data, one-year survival for Center’s heart transplant patients exceeds 95 percent, well above the national average of 91 percent.
“Our nationally-recognized heart transplant volumes and outcomes have allowed us to establish confidence and collaboration within the community,” said David DeNofrio, MD, Director of the Advanced Heart Failure Program at Center. “This trust has helped us cultivate and grow community partnerships built on communication, mutual goals and delivering results.” 
“We strengthen the heart failure programs of our physician partners throughout the region and keep as much care local as possible,” said Amanda Vest, MBBS,  Director of the Cardiac Transplantation Program at Center. “This grassroots effort has led to a dramatic expansion of our referral network, which now stretches across New England and into upstate New York.” 
Center’s expert heart failure care expands beyond just cardiac transplantation. The is also a national leader in the placement of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) - mechanical heart pumps used for treating patients with end-stage heart failure. has been an innovator in the field of mechanical circulatory support and is a leading enroller in clinical trials that have resulted in approval of novel technologies for use in heart failure patients. 
“LVADs can be used for either short- or intermediate-term heart support to keep patients alive while awaiting heart transplantation, or as a long-term or permanent therapy in patients with advanced heart disease who are not eligible for transplantation,” said Michael Kiernan, , Director of the Ventricular Assist Device Program at Center. “These devices have been demonstrated to prolong life and improve quality of life and functionality in patients with end-stage heart failure.” 
To provide this depth and breadth of advanced heart failure expertise, has assembled a dedicated multidisciplinary team of physicians, surgeons, anesthesiologists, infectious disease specialists, nurses, social workers, nutritionists, administrators, perfusionists and technicians, all working together to deliver optimal patient care and produce best-possible outcomes.

approval of kidney drug "a game changer" for patients
Claudia Iliescu’s youthful appearance belies her actual age of 47. Unfortunately, Claudia’s kidneys have not aged nearly as gracefully. Claudia suffers from autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease  (ADPKD), a chronic, hereditary condition in which cysts grow inside the kidneys, reducing kidney function, and ultimately resulting in kidney failure and a premature need for dialysis or transplant. 
About and a new treatment
“It’s a devastating disease that impacts multiple family members for generations,” said Claudia. “My 70-year-old mother has been on dialysis for the past 10 years. My grandmother died at 56 from complications. And have many aunts, uncles and cousins on my mother’s side who have been affected by this disease.”
There is no cure for ADPKD, but now there is reason for optimism for Claudia and other patients. On April 24, 2018, the Food and Drug Administration approved Tolvaptan , the first-ever disease-modifying drug for Tolvaptan slows the growth of kidney cysts and prolongs kidney function.
Seeking treatment 
Claudia was diagnosed with at age 22, but didn’t start experiencing symptoms until her 30s. Starting in 2010, she began having occasional sharp pain and discomfort in her abdomen. Due to a combination of kidney and liver disease, it became difficult for her to eat or bend over.
In early 2012, Claudia entered a three-year clinical trial at – on the recommendation of her nephrologist, Associate Chief of the Division of Nephrology   Ronald Perrone,  – to test the effectiveness of Tolvaptan for Dr. Perrone served as the Principal Investigator at the study site and helped design the study and monitor its progress. While a bit skeptical at first, Claudia was thrilled with the results. 
“Tolvaptan prevented my pain from getting worse and slowed the growth of the cysts in my kidneys,” she said. “And now the approval confirms that Tolvaptan works. am very hopeful that it will help me and other people diagnosed with enjoy many more years without needing dialysis or a kidney transplant.” 
“This is a major breakthrough,” said Dr. Perrone. “is the fourth-leading cause of kidney failure in the U.S.; it greatly impacts quality of life and can lead to other serious health complications. Now, a single pill taken twice per day can slow the disease’s progression, allowing patients to be able to enjoy additional years of adequate kidney function before requiring additional intervention. That’s a game-changer for these patients.” 
The for Polycystic Kidney Disease  at Center, the only in Boston, has extensive experience in diagnosing and managing chronic kidney disease. For more information, or to make an appointment, call 617-636-5866.

Our Background and History
Boston is home to over 26,000 Asian residents , representing 9% of the city’s population, and constituting one of the fast-growing groups in the city. Asian immigrants tend to underutilize health care services, and often lack the information, time or resources necessary to practice preventive health maintenance. This can be attributed in part to cultural differences and linguistic barriers, as well as financial concerns, such as lack of health insurance.
In response to the health needs of Boston’s Asian community, Center, in consultation with the South Cove/Chinatown Neighborhood Council, established the Asian Health Initiative (AHI) and its advisory committee in 1995.  The identifies public health issues of particular prevalence or concern to the local Asian community and seeks to work collaboratively with local community-based organizations to help address those health issues in a culturally and linguistically appropriate setting.
Since its inception, funded programs and projects have addressed: tuberculosis, hypertension, hepatitis B, chronic disease prevention, domestic and family violence, smoking cessation and prevention, and the importance of primary care and understanding the American health care system, among other health issues. Because of the diversity of the programs and organizations supported, the has been able to reach a broad segment of the Asian community, from toddlers to senior citizens.
As of 2011, the Asian/Pacific Islander community is the fastest growing group nationally. It now comprises 5.8% of the total population nationally , 5.3% of the total population in Massachusetts , and 8.9% in the city of Boston. Within the state there is a high concentration in the Greater Boston area, especially in Quincy, Malden, Brookline, Cambridge and Newton. In addition, Lowell, Worcester, Fall River, and Springfield also have sizable and diverse Asian populations.
In 2012, 46.4% of Boston Asian and Pacific Island language-speaking households were considered linguistically isolated , or had no one within the household 14 years of age and older who spoke English only, or spoke English well. This can present a significant barrier  to health care services and education.
Health data for Boston’s Asian community suggests that while Asian residents enjoy a longer life expectancy (88.8 years vs. 79.9 years for Boston residents overall), they experience certain preventable diseases at higher rates than other communities, including lung cancer (42.1 cases per 100,000 Asian residents vs. 39.1 in Boston overall) and Hepatitis (325.4 cases per 100,000 Asian residents vs. 57.9 in Boston overall).
The Boston Public Health Commission’s  Health of Boston  report identified lung cancer as the leading cause of death among Boston’s Asian population in 2012. Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and can exacerbate many chronic illnesses such as heart disease, diabetes, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.
Smoking is particularly prevalent in foreign-born Asian American men. According to a  2002 study  by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, in Massachusetts, foreign born Asian American men were more than three times more likely to smoke than Asian Americans born in the US.
The 2017-2019 Asian Health Initiative funded programs will be addressing the challenging issue of smoking and its associated health risks. 
The Asian American Civic Association  is disseminating health information through its Sampan Newspaper, publishing 24 bilingual health-focused editions for each year. The health columns will focus primarily on smoking, prevention, cessation and long-term effects. Sampan will also publish and distribute a bilingual smoking cessation help directory, which will list all available information and treatment centers for quitting smoking. Sampan is partnering with the Clean Up Chinatown Committee for additional outreach and awareness efforts in the community. 
The Boston Asian: Youth Essential Service  is offering “Smoke-Free Healthy You & Me,” a youth-led anti-smoking prevention and education program aimed at raising awareness among community youth, residents and other community members of the health risks and serious illnesses caused by cigarette smoking and second-hand smoke. The program will engage twelve youth in a 10-week training that will cover tobacco and cigarette smoking facts and fiction, tobacco industry adverting tactics targeting youth and low-income people.  Youth will learn about addiction and why people start, and other relevant information.   An additional twenty youth will also be trained to plan and implement anti-smoking campaign activities. 
The Boston Chinatown Neighborhood  is offering the Smoke Free Chinatown program in an effort to directly engage members of the Chinatown community in educational activities on the health effects of smoking and smoking-cessation resources. The program will use a number of its existing programs and communication channels to disseminate smoking information to the children, youth, adults, and families who access services at the neighborhood center. The program offers a family-centered approach, engaging children and adults with age-appropriate activities including after-school education and family workshops.
The Greater Boston Chinese Golden Age  is offering a Smoke-Free Living Program to provide workshops to 200 Chinese-American adults to help them understand the problems of tobacco usage and the negative effects on one’s health.  Those who attend the workshops will be able to introduce and refer other tobacco users to the program, especially those eager to quit smoking and adopt a healthier lifestyle. The workshops will provide intensive discussions and advice on smoking issues and health-related problems. smoke-free health fair will be held at the end of the year in order to help facilitate the creation of a smoke-free environment for healthy living. 
Josiah Quincy Elementary School is implementing a comprehensive tobacco prevention program for its students. They will implement an evidence-based health education curriculum for approximately 900 students targeting 3rd, 4th and 5th grade students. Classes will be led by a full-time health educator and conducted throughout the school year.  The school is also addressing smoking within the home by inviting families to two Family Night events, which will offer smoking cessation resources and education.
The Rose Kennedy Greenway and the Asian American Civic Association are partnering to offer a culturally sensitive smoking cessation program that will tackle the problem of chronic smoking in the Mary Soo Hoo Park. The Asian American Civic Association will address the issue of widespread smoking addiction in Chinese Americans who use the park as a social gathering spot. An English, Cantonese and Mandarin-speaking Smoking Specialist will provide individual counseling in person and through a help phone line to smokers in the park. The specialist will also work with the Greenway to install bilingual signs as well as design and distribute educational materials to educate smokers about health risks and options they have to help quit smoking including aids. 
The Wang of Chinatown  offered the No-Smoke Program from 2016-2017, which targeted community members across a wide age range but with a special emphasis on Chinese male restaurant workers who had been identified as at-risk and in need of intervention assistance. The Wang used outreach and worksite visits to bring health education and information to workers in Chinatown and nearby suburban Chinese restaurants. The program also engaged families to provide education about 2nd and 3rd hand smoke that may be found in a smoker’s home, which impact the health of other family members, especially children.

Two Research Studies are being recognized in 2018 Clinical Research Forum Top Ten
The Clinical Research (CR) Forum recently announced the important and groundbreaking clinical research studies that will be recognized at the 2018 Top Ten Clinical Research Achievement Awards at the National Press Club in Washington, on April 18.
Two studies were recognized as awardees:
Effect of Intra-articular Triamcinolone vs Saline on Knee Cartilage Volume and Pain,” led by Timothy McAlindon, MD, MPH,  Chief of the Division of Rheumatology
Long-Term Outcomes of Patent Foramen Ovale Closure or Therapy after Stroke,” led by David Thaler, MD, PhD, , Neurologist-in-Chief
Dr. McAlindon's study
Dr. McAlindon’s study was conducted to determine if corticosteroid injections administered to knee osteoarthritis patients every three months for two years would reduce cartilage damage and benefit pain and functional ability, as well as learn whether the injections would damage joint structures. Dr. McAlindon’s team enrolled 140 patients for the study; half received the steroid intervention and half received a placebo injection.
“What we found there was no benefit for receiving the corticosteroid injection in regards to pain or physical function, and in fact, the group who got the corticosteroid injections exhibited more cartilage loss,” said Dr. McAlindon. “Overall, this study does not support the use of repeated corticosteroid injections for treating osteoarthritis of the knee joint.”
Dr. Thaler's study
Dr. Thaler studied a specific stroke mechanism that typically happens in younger people, related to a hole in the heart known as a Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO). His team randomized 1,000 patients; some were treated by implanting a small device into the heart to close the hole, while others were treated with therapy such as blood-thinning medication and risk factor modification.
“We found that the benefit for stroke prevention, and in particular for preventing the kind of stroke related to PFO, was greater in the device group,” said Dr. Thaler. “This led to the approval of the first device indicated for stroke prevention in patients with stroke and PFO.”
Selected among the top ten
Following a nationwide call for nominations, Dr. McAlindon and Dr. Thaler’s studies were among the ten selected by the Forum Board of Directors based on the degree of innovation and novelty involved in the advancement of science; contribution to the understanding of human disease and/or physiology; and potential impact upon the diagnosis, prevention, and/or treatment of disease. 
“This year, we were gratified to see a tremendous increase in nominations, and the level of scientific rigor, quality, and innovation was truly outstanding,” said Harry Selker, MD, MSPH, Chair of the Forum Board of Directors. “It was a very difficult decision-making process, but as a result, we can say with confidence that these ten studies are truly remarkable.”
On April 18, Drs. McAlindon and Thaler will join their fellow awardees for a gala dinner and reception at the National Press Club in Washington, 
Awardees will have the opportunity to meet with policymakers the day after the ceremony to discuss their findings and the critical role of federal funding for clinical research.
