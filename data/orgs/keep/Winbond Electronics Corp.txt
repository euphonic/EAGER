Quality Management Program
The purpose of Quality Management Program at is to establish the control
s needed to assure that the quality and reliability of our products fully satisfy our customers. We strive to deliver competitive products free from defects and to provide our customers with prompt, professional service. Our Quality Management Program focuses on three major areas: quality control, reliability assurance, and failure analysis.
has implemented a series of quality control functions that cover all the steps in manufacturing process. The main steps in this quality control procedure are:
Incoming materials inspection
Electrical characteristics testing
Chip assembly
Constant monitoring on all steps in the manufacturing process and information feedback at all levels allow fast and efficient detection of problems, evaluation and analysis, and corrective measures. We emphasize that each step in the manufacturing process should be undertaken with a "Do it right at the first time" attitude and must produce a defect-free output. The over-all result is a line of high-quality, reliable products.
At Winbond, the aim of reliability assurance testing is to assure high-level product performance throughout the intended life of the products. Each manufacturing phase is subject to continuous review, analysis, and evaluation, with modifications introduced to further improve quality and reliability. Our reliability system is based on three important sources of reliability data:
Real time monitor and conformity tests
Field failure information
Failure Analysis
Failure analysis, which determines the cause of product failures and proposes corrective action, is an important part of reliability assurance. At Winbond, scanning electron microscopes, diagnostic probe stations, optical microscopes, and many other precision instruments are used to perform failure analysis on devices submitted from various sources. Defective ICs are logged into the laboratory for inspection and for preparation of corrective action reports.
Packaging Technology And Subcontractor Management
works closely with assembly subcontractors to provide the best possible package form to maximize a device's performance and to meet customer's special demands. Our extensive subcontractor selection, qualification, and management program is strictly followed to insure the delivery of high-quality products from our subcontractors. In addition, conducts a rigid program to monitor package reliability which helps to insure the mechanical integrity of every package type produced by each production facility.

Verification and reduction of greenhouse gas emission
Target: Taking 2010 as the base year, 8% reduction of emissions per unit of product by 2020（≦ 15.1 kg CO
2017: emissions 313,177 ton CO
According to Protocol (The Greenhouse Gas Protocol) and 14064-1, has established the complete list of the greenhouse gas emission. The verification is ranging from, Scope 1-(direct emission of greenhouse gas), Scope 2-(indirect greenhouse emission), the verification of qualitative and quantity, Scope 3-other indirect greenhouse gas emission, the main emission qualitative verification. According to the statistics, the greenhouse gas emission of is mainly from the outsourced electric power that company demand. CO
 will be generated by the process. Also produce greenhouse gas while manufacturing semiconductor by using PFCs (Perfluorocarbons) including CF
, etc. The result of greenhouse gas emission quantities passes the examination, confirmed by the third party every year.
The mainly emission of manufacturing stage comes from PFCs and electric power. Therefore, focusing on reducing PFCs gas and electric power not only reduce the overall amount emission of greenhouse gas efficiently but also can reduce the carbon footprint of products.
The promotion of reducing PFCs plan and measurement, as follows:
The usage of tool and its prevention facilities measurement of reduction rate and improvement.
To carry out the evaluation of the usage of PFCs tool.
To carry out the selection evaluation of the new PFCs processing prevention facilities
Target: Electricity usage per unit of product by 2020 is lower than 2010（≦ 22.99 KWH/layer）
The plants are constructed based on energy-saving designs that help save energy in the plant management system. Using a supervisory control and data acquisition system (SCADA), energy use data are monitored and analyzed to achieve optimal management on energy reduction. Continuously promote energy-saving measures to reduce energy use.
Target: Water usage per unit of product is lower than 150 L/layer and water reuse rate is higher than 80% until 2020.
We establish a design for water supply and reclaim pipeline system; implement a 24-hour all-time control and monitoring system to monitor water use across the plant; renew water-saving plans annually and review effectiveness regularly.
Waste management
Target: Waste recycling rate is higher than 90% until 2020.
2017: Waste recycling rate 90%
We reduce the amount of waste by reducing the use, reuse and recycling of waste. Recycling and reuse are given a priority for consideration in waste disposal to minimize impacts on the environment. Make annual plans of waste abatement, and review the effectiveness on a regular basis.

Identification of Stakeholder Engagement
Aiming at sustainable development and long-term operation, identifies its stakeholders based on the five major principles of the AA1000 (Stakeholder Engagement Standard 2011), including Dependency, Responsibility, Influence, Tension, and Diverse Perspectives. Seven categories of key stakeholders are identified, including employees, government, clients/distributors, suppliers/subcontractors, shareholders/investors, banks/financial institutions, and media. In 2017, there was no difference categories of key stakeholders compared to 2016.
Identification of Material Aspects
Based on Winbond’s corporate culture and business philosophy and according to the definition and categorization of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) and the Sustainability Report Guideline (G4) published by the Global Sustainability Report Association (GRI), the Implementation Committee summarizes the sustainability issues from economic, environmental, and societal aspects.
To understand the stakeholders’ level of concern in terms of the sustainability issues, we conducted a survey with the corresponding organizations of the stakeholders by means of interview or questionnaire. The participants were asked to rate their “level of concern of sustainability issues” on a 5-point scale with 5-Extremely concerned, 4-highly concerned, 3-somewhat concerned, 2-slightly concerned, and 1-not at all concerned. During 2017, a total of 127 questionnaires were returned. Similarly, for the question “the impact of sustainability issues on Winbond’s operations,” the Company’s high level management were asked to rate the level of impact on a 5-point scale.
The substantial analytical results show that twelve issues were identified as material issues, including Economic Performance, Customer Health and Safety, Emissions, Customer Privacy, Water, Product and Service Labeling, Compliance (Environmental), Compliance(Social), Energy, Patent Right, Training and Education, Employment. When considering these material issues under the G4 guidelines, (Disclosure on Management Approach) and indicators related to management policy are selected as the main aspect for disclosure. For issues of low and medium concern, we continue to communicate and respond to our stakeholders and conduct management as well as demonstrate the results in the chapters concerning product responsibility, environmental sustainability and team accountability, including Compliance (Production), Procurement Practices, Overall, Effluents and Waste, Occupational Health and Safety, Equal Remuneration for Women and Men…etc.
