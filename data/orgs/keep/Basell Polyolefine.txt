Nearly 70 years of Innovation
With a nearly 70-year legacy of game-changing innovation, our company has developed new products and technologies that serve as the bedrock of the chemical industry. Below are some of our key contributions.
Predecessor company scientists Karl Ziegler and Giulio Natta make breakthrough discoveries in the creation of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). and resins are used today to make numerous products, including automobile parts, surgical gowns, children’s toys, wind turbines and water pipes. They were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1963.
Hoechst, a predecessor company, initiated industrial-scale production of in Frankfurt, Germany.
First Hostalen high density polyethylene (HDPE) process plant starts up.
completes start-up of the world’s largest low density polyethylene plant (LDPE) in Berre, France, with a single line capacity of 320,000 tons per year.
Lyondellbegins construction of the first commercial Hyperzone plant in La Porte, Texas, utilizing the company’s new proprietary technology. plastics produced using the Hyperzone process technology exhibit enhanced characteristics including superior toughness properties that make end-use products less likely to break or tear. Potential end-use products include healthcare packaging, high pressure pipe, children’s toys, household bottles and intermediate bulk containers.
Lyondell(NYSE: LYB) is one of the largest plastics, chemicals and refining companies in the world. Driven by its employees around the globe, Lyondellproduces materials and products that are key to advancing solutions to modern challenges like enhancing food safety through lightweight and flexible packaging, protecting the purity of water supplies through stronger and more versatile pipes, improving the safety, comfort and fuel efficiency of many of the cars and trucks on the road, and ensuring the safe and effective functionality in electronics and appliances.

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (the “Act”) entered into effect on January 1, 2012. The law requires manufacturers and retailers to make publicly available information related to their efforts to eradicate the risks of slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains. Although Lyondelldoes not currently:
verify product supply chains to evaluate and address these risks,
conduct audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards regarding these risks,
require all of our direct suppliers to certify that the materials incorporated in our products comply with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the countries where they do business,
maintain internal standards and processes for employees and contractors who fail to meet company standards regarding these risks,
provide training for employees who have direct responsibility for supply chain management on this subject matter,
Lyondellis committed to conducting business in an ethical and responsible manner, which includes complying with applicable slavery and human trafficking laws. Most of LyondellBasell’s direct suppliers are located in the United States or in Western European countries that have extensive laws prohibiting slavery and human trafficking.   Lyondelldoes not typically have direct relationships with suppliers in at-risk countries identified in the Department of State’s 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report and the Department of Labor’s 2016 List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor.
Below are the Lyondellprograms and standards that reflect the objectives of the Act:
Lyondellhas actively participated in the C-program since 2003. C-is a voluntary government program designed to increase security throughout the global supply chain. The C-program involves risk-based audits of the company and unannounced audits of suppliers. 
Lyondellhas actively participated in the program since 2010. Like C-TPAT, is a voluntary program administered by member countries that requires high quality internal processes to ensure the integrity of the global supply chain.  The program involves internal audits as well as verifications of supply chain security and random on-site audits performed by the customs authorities.
LyondellBasell’s purchase order terms and conditions require suppliers to comply with all applicable laws, including forced labor and human trafficking laws.
LyondellBasell’s Code of Conduct embodies our dedication to conducting business ethically and responsibly by obeying the law and enabling a safe and productive work environment. LyondellBasell’s Code states that “we take great care to uphold human rights in all of our operations and facilities, regardless of local custom.  Our Company does not use child or forced, indentured or involuntary labor.” 
All employees, officers, directors, and anyone doing business on behalf of Lyondellare expected to know and abide by this Code at all times. Rigorous training on the content and application of the Code is mandatory for each and every employee, and each employee must periodically acknowledge that they have read, understood, and agree to comply with the Code. Lyondelltakes seriously and fully investigates all potential Code violations. The failure to report any suspected Code violation or misconduct immediately may also be considered a violation of the Code. When an allegation of an employee Code violation is substantiated, the relevant management team reviews the investigation findings and determines disciplinary action consistent with the severity of the violation. Disciplinary action can include verbal or written warning, suspension with or without pay, demotion or, for the most serious offenses or repeated misconduct, employment termination. 
Our Leadership Team is comprised of senior executives that lead LyondellBasell’s businesses and staff functions. The Leadership Team oversees operational issues and the implementation of corporate strategies and provides vital support and expertise to our Chief Executive Officer.

 technology, which produces plastic resins that have improved characteristics. Startup of the plant is planned for 2019.
Additionally, plans for a world-scale propylene oxide and tertiary butyl alcohol (PO/TBA) plant at the company's Channelview site are progressing. The project is expected to produce 1 billion pounds-per-year of propylene oxide and 2.3 billion pounds-per-year of tertiary butyl alcohol.

EBITDA: $1.7 billion, a year-over-year increase in four segments
Acquired Schulman, Inc., creating the global leader in plastics compounding
Launched Advanced Polymer Solutions segment: a new platform for growth
Started construction on our new propylene oxide plant in Texas   
Issued dividends and repurchased shares totaling $720 million; 3.2 million shares repurchased during the third quarter
Comparisons with the prior quarter and third quarter 2017 are available in the following table:
(a) See the end of this release for an explanation of the Company's use of and Table 9 for reconciliations of to net income.
LyondellIndustries (NYSE: LYB) today announced net income for the third quarter 2018 of $1.1 billion, or $2.85 per share.  Integration activities related to the acquisition of Schulman are on schedule and estimated to have generated $32 million in forward annual run-rate synergies.  The quarter included $53 million of transaction and integration costs, which decreased earnings by $0.11 per share.  Third quarter 2018 was $1.7 billion.
"LyondellBasell's resilient global portfolio continued to deliver strong profitability, which generated third quarter that exceeded last year's quarterly results in four segments. Our olefins and polyolefins business in the Americas achieved improvements in chain margins and volumes that overcame third quarter headwinds from rising feedstock costs and new supply to drive increased profitability for the segment.  Robust global demand supported attractive margins and earnings for our Intermediates and Derivatives segment.  In our Technology segment, increased licensing of LyondellBasell's polyolefins technologies generated through the end of the third quarter that exceeded all previous full-year records while our focus on operational improvements at our refinery continued to yield meaningful results," said Bob Patel, LyondellCEO.
"Our company surpassed significant milestones on our value-driven growth initiatives during the third quarter.  In August, we completed the acquisition of Schulman, launched our new Advanced Polymer Solutions segment and advanced our organic growth program with the groundbreaking of our new propylene oxide plant," said Patel.
"LyondellBasell's feedstock flexibility and balanced portfolio of global businesses provides competitive advantage during these periods of increased volatility in energy, natural gas liquids pricing and global trade.   We are well-positioned to capture value with expanded access to markets and increased synergies from the integration of Schulman and the formation of our new Advanced Polymer Solutions segment.  During the fourth quarter, we will advance our growth projects and expect to drive further operational and business improvements in our Intermediates and Derivatives, Refining and Technology businesses," Patel said.
Lyondellmanages operations through six operating segments: 1) Olefins and Polyolefins - Americas; 2) Olefins and Polyolefins - Europe, Asia and International; 3) Intermediates and Derivatives; 4) Advanced Polymer Solutions; 5) Refining; and 6) Technology.  Third quarter results for our new Advanced Polymer Solutions segment represents a full quarter of results from the Lyondellpolypropylene compounds, Catalloy and polybutene-1 businesses as well as results for the businesses acquired from Schulman beginning on August 21, 2018.  Historical segment results for Olefins and Polyolefins - Americas and Olefins and Polyolefins - Europe, Asia and International were recast as a result of the shift of product lines to Advanced Polymer Solutions.
Olefins & Polyolefins - Americas (O&P-Americas) - Our O&P-Americas segment produces and markets Olefins & Co-products, polyethylene and polypropylene.
Three months ended September 30, 2018 versus three months ended June 30, 2018 - increased by $33 million versus the second quarter 2018.  Compared with the prior period, olefins results increased by approximately $120 million.  Ethylene margin improved as the ethylene price increased approximately 4 cents per pound.  Polyethylene results declined approximately $80 million primarily due to a decrease of approximately 6 cents per pound in the polyethylene spread over ethylene.
Three months ended September 30, 2018 versus three months ended September 30, 2017 - increased $113 million versus the third quarter 2017.  Compared with the prior period, olefins results increased by approximately $30 million.  Volume increased with the absence of third quarter 2017 Hurricane Harvey impacts partially offset by a decline in ethylene margin.  Polyolefin results increased by approximately $100 million driven by spread improvements in polyethylene and polypropylene over monomer of approximately 6 cents per pound and 3 cents per pound, respectively.  Joint venture equity income increased by $10 million.
Olefins & Polyolefins - Europe, Asia, International (O&P-EAI) - Our O&P-segment produces and markets Olefins and Co-products, polyethylene and polypropylene.
Three months ended September 30, 2018 versus three months ended June 30, 2018 - decreased by $93 million versus the second quarter 2018.  Compared with the prior period, olefins results decreased by approximately $55 million.  Volume declined with the start of planned maintenance at our cracker in Wesseling, Germany and margin decreased with higher feedstock costs outpacing olefins price improvements.  Combined polyolefins results decreased approximately $45 million primarily due to seasonal declines in volumes.  Joint venture equity income increased by $15 million.
Three months ended September 30, 2018 versus three months ended September 30, 2017 - decreased by $337 million versus the third quarter 2017, which included a gain of $108 million on the sale of our interest in Geosel.  Compared with the prior period, olefins results decreased approximately $100 million.  Margin declined as ethylene price improvement lagged feedstock cost increases and volume declined with the start of planned maintenance in the third quarter 2018.  Combined polyolefins results decreased approximately $110 million.  Polyolefin spreads declined approximately 3 cents per pound and sales volumes decreased due to unusually strong volumes in the third quarter of 2017.
Intermediates & Derivatives (I&D) - Our I&segment produces and markets Propylene Oxide & Derivatives, Oxyfuels and Related Products and Intermediate Chemicals, such as styrene monomer, acetyls, ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol.
Three months ended September 30, 2018 versus three months ended June 30, 2018 - decreased $138 million versus the record-setting second quarter 2018 results.  Compared with the prior period, Propylene Oxide & Derivatives results decreased approximately $50 million.  Volumes declined due to both planned and unplanned maintenance.  Margins declined due to lower seasonal demand.  Intermediate Chemicals results decreased approximately $35 million, primarily due to a decline in styrene margin of approximately 4 cents per pound.  Oxyfuels & Related Products results decreased $55 million, primarily driven by seasonal margin declines.
Three months ended September 30, 2018 versus three months ended September 30, 2017 - increased $102 million versus the third quarter 2017.  Compared with the prior period, Propylene Oxide & Derivatives results decreased approximately $10 million with volume losses from 2018 planned and unplanned maintenance exceeding hurricane impacts during the third quarter 2017.  Intermediate Chemicals results increased approximately $105 million driven by tight industry supplies and strong demand driving improved margins for acetyls, ethylene glycol and styrene.  Oxyfuels & Related Products increased by approximately $10 million.
Advanced Polymer Solutions (APS) - Our Advanced Polymer Solutions segment produces and markets in two lines of business: Compounding & Solutions and Advanced Polymers.  Compounding & Solutions includes polypropylene compounds, engineered plastics, masterbatches, engineered composites, colors and powders.  Advanced Polymers consists of Catalloy and polybutene-1.
Three months ended September 30, 2018 versus three months ended June 30, 2018 - decreased by $51 million versus the second quarter 2018.  Schulman was acquired on August 21, 2018 and results from the new business are included prospectively.  Transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition and assigned to the segment were $49 million during the third quarter 2018.  Compared with the prior period, Compounding & Solutions results were relatively unchanged.  The addition of new product lines from the acquisition offset seasonal volume and margin declines in polypropylene compounds.  Advanced Polymers results were relatively unchanged with some seasonal volume reductions.
Three months ended September 30, 2018 versus three months ended September 30, 2017 - decreased by $54 million versus the third quarter 2017.  Schulman was acquired on August 21, 2018 and results from the new business are included prospectively.  Transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition and assigned to the segment were $49 million during the third quarter 2018.  Compared with the prior period, Compounding & Solutions results were relatively unchanged.
