Among the organizations receiving a 2018 Foundation grant is the Nashville Public Library Foundation, which is receiving its third grant from the Foundation this year. The Nashville Public Library was named the 2017 Library of the Year by Library Journal Magazine, recognizing its profound service to the community, creativity, leadership and innovation in developing community programs. The library started the “Civil Rights and a Civil Society” program as a training experience for law enforcement officials, a platform for discussing complex community dynamics through a historical framework. Over the past year the program has expanded to include community organizations, schools, corporate groups and delegations from other cities. The Nashville Public Library will use its 2018 Foundation grant to support continued expansion of the program.
Another Foundation 2018 grantee is the Tanenbaum Center for Interreligious Understanding, a secularnonprofit that promotes mutual respect with practical programs that bridge religious difference and combat prejudice in schools, workplaces, health care settings and combat zones.

The resources include fact sheets on current issues such as white supremacy and the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar. Materials include targeted questions for use by teachers, religious leaders, community organizers and parents.
