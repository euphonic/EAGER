There's an optimism that comes with looking five or ten years ahead—to the ideas that signal the                       future. Our deep partnerships with innovative technology companies keep tomorrow’s innovations                       on track.
How We Do It
We inhabit two worlds: one that's nanometers in scale and one that's global. This micro                       and macro view gives us a unique perspective. We see electrons wave and industries transform.                       When you put deep science together with optimism, big things happen.
Last year we invested over $600 million in R&That's a measure of our commitment to                           solving the most daunting technical challenges. From our ground-breaking mask inspection                           tool in 1975 that signaled the dawn of semiconductor process control, to today's broadband                           plasma technology that discovers defects at the speed of light, we like to arrive first.
Active collaboration multiplies agile thinking. We put this approach into practice at                           strategic, technical and operational levels with our partners. Working side-by-side both                           geographically and intellectually, we maximize discovery and solutions.
We have a proven ability to go from concept to global marketplace. We invent in-house, make                           strategic acquisitions and share technology across systems to diversify our perspectives                           and widen the range of our solutions. Comprehensive service programs keep it all optimized.
We support a range of community and charitable initiatives with funding and volunteer                       opportunities: education, health and wellness programs, local aid and international                       disaster relief. We sponsor the Second Harvest Food Bank in Santa Clara County and fight river                       blindness in Africa. Not for profit, just for humanity.
