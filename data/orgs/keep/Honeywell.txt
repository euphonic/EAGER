Honeywell's story stretches back more than 130 years and encompasses several predecessor companies and the inspiring work of tens of thousands of people. But our core mission and values have been consistent:
vision for a secure, comfortable, cleaner, more efficient future...
steadfast belief in the power of innovation...
And a relentless drive for continuous improvement.
And they continue to inspire and guide us as we create new solutions for the challenges of tomorrow.
More than 130 Years of Innovation
Our roots reach to 1885, when an inventor named Albert Butz patented the furnace regulator and alarm. He formed the Butz Thermo-Electric Regulator Co., Minneapolis, in April 1886, and soon invented a device he called the "damper flapper” – an ingenious predecessor to the modern thermostat.
Here's how it worked. When a room cooled below a predetermined temperature, a thermostat closed the circuit and energized an armature. This pulled the stop from the motor gears, allowing a crank attached to the main motor shaft to turn one-half revolution. chain connected to the crank opened the furnace's air damper to let in air. This made the fire burn hotter. When the temperature rose to the preset level, the thermostat signaled the motor to turn another half revolution, closing the damper and damping the fire. The temperature correction was automatic. Over the years, many products have been based upon similar, but more complicated closed-loop systems.
The Consolidated Temperature Controlling Co. acquired Butz's patents and business, and by 1893, had renamed itself Electric Heat Regulator Co. In 1898, the company was purchased by Sweatt, who, by 1916, named the company Minneapolis Heat Regulator Company, expanded its product line and patented the first electric motor approved by Underwriters Laboratories.
Meanwhile, in Wabash, Indiana...
In 1904, a young engineer named Mark – from whom our name originated – was perfecting the heat generator as part of his plumbing and heating business. Two years later, he formed the Heating Specialty Co. Incorporated, specializing in hot water heat generators.
In 1927, Minneapolis Heat Regulator Company and Heating Specialty Co. merged to form the Minneapolis-Regulator Co., and became the largest producer of high-quality jeweled clocks. Sweatt became Chairman and Mark became President. The company quickly grew as it began to tackle more challenges, including industrial controls and indicators.
Business Around the World 
The company has been selling its products throughout the world for a long time. In 1934, the company acquired Time-O-Stat Controls Corporation and began establishing a track record of global expansion. We established offices in Toronto, the Netherlands, London and Stockholm. By 1941, The company had distributors in Chile, Panama, Trinidad, New Zealand, Argentina, and South Africa. By 1972, we operated 25 wholly-owned subsidiaries, 142 branch offices, and joint ventures in five countries outside the In 1993, the company opened affiliates in Abu Dhabi, China, Oman, Romania, and the Ukraine. By 1998, the company had operations in 95 countries.
Products, Developments and Acquisitions
Minneapolis-Regulator Co. leveraged its scientific and engineering talent to adapt to changing times. We radically improved mass production and added an array of aeronautical equipment to our portfolio. In 1942, we invented the electronic autopilot, which proved vital to the war effort.
In 1953, the company introduced the iconic T-86 "Round" thermostat, which replaced chunky, rectangular models. One of the world's most recognizable designs, it remains in production today and is used in more households around the world than any other thermostat.
In 1954, we began working to make gyroscopes more sensitive and precise while reducing their size and weight – and continued improving them over the next two decades.
In 1955, we established a partnership with Raytheon Corp., marking Honeywell's entry into the computer business.
In 1957, we began working on fire detection and alarm systems. In many North American cities, the red and black "Protected by Honeywell" window stickers and placards were nearly as recognizable as the “Round” thermostat. Today we are the global leader in the industry.
The company's name was officially changed to in 1963.
Six years later, instruments helped astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin land on the moon.
In 1970, merged its computer business with General Electric's to form Information Systems. In 1986, the personal computer emerged and the company formed Bull, a global joint venture with Compagnie des Machines Bull of France and Corporation of Japan. Its ownership level was gradually decreased until, in 1991, was no longer in the computer business. The company's digital computer knowledge lives on today in the field of automation control, integrating sensors, and activators.
During World War I, Germany controlled much of the world's chemical industry, causing shortages among the and our allies of critical drugs and dyes. In 1920, publisher Eugene Meyer and scientist William Nichols formed the Allied Chemical & Dye Corporation as a partnership of five American chemical companies.
In 1928, Allied opened a synthetic ammonia plant and quickly became the world's leading producer of ammonia .
After World War II, Allied began manufacturing other new products, including nylon 6 (used in manufacturing everything from tires to clothes) and refrigerants. 
In 1962, Allied bought Union Texas Natural Gas, which owned oil and gas properties throughout the Americas. Allied focused on it mainly as a supplier of raw materials for its chemical products, but this changed in the early 1970s when John Connor (secretary of commerce under Lyndon Johnson) began investing in oil and gas exploration. By 1979, when Edward Hennessy Jr. became CEO, Union Texas produced 80% of Allied's income.
Now Allied Corp., the company went on to purchase the Bendix Corp., an aerospace and automotive company, in 1983. By 1984, Bendix generated 50% of Allied's income, while oil and gas generated 38%.
In 1985, Allied merged with the Signal Companies, adding critical mass to its aerospace, automotive and engineered materials businesses. Signal was originally a California company that produced gasoline from natural gas and entered oil production in 1928.
Aerospace was now Allied-Signal's largest sector. In mid-1991, with new leadership in many key businesses, Allied-Signal began taking bold actions to become more efficient, increase productivity, and position the company as a global competitive force. The Allied-Signal name was changed to AlliedSignal in 1993 to reinforce a one-company image and signify the full integration of all of its businesses.
In 1992, the company sold its remaining interest in Union Texas through a public offering for $940 million in net proceeds.
In 1999, was acquired by AlliedSignal, who elected to retain the name for its brand recognition and the company's headquarters was moved to the AlliedSignal headquarters in Morristown, Together the companies share huge business interests in aerospace, chemical products, automotive parts, and building controls.
Then In 2000, the acquired Pittway to gain a greater share of the fire-protection and security systems market.  
In 2002, David Cote was named Chairman and of Honeywell. Under Cote's leadership, transformed from a company with three competing cultures from AlliedSignal, Pittway and the legacy to “One Honeywell,” a recognized global industrial leader that is making strategic investment in products, processes, people and geographies.
In 2018, Darius Adamczyk became Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Before then, he was President and Chief Executive Officer after serving for a year as Chief Operating Officer and holding a variety of positions sjoining in 2008.
His focus is on accelerating Honeywell’s organic growth, expanding margins, transforming the Company into a premier software-industrial, deploying capital effectively, and building a high-performance culture.
In 2018, completed spinoffs of its transportation business into Garrett Motion Inc and homes business into Resideo, which uses Home under a long-term, exclusive license.
Today, is headquartered in Morris Plains, with operations at about 970 sites in 70 countries. With more than 110,000 employees worldwide, including 18,000 engineers and 9,000 software developers, we build on our substantial legacy with a focus on growth, innovation, improved customer experience and shareowner value.SOLUTIONS
