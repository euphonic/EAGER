cornerstone of the Canadian forest innovation system is the innovation hub. 
has been a catalyst in creating an innovation hub for the forest sector involving the industry, governments, universities, suppliers and the innovation capacity of FPInnovations. 
The hub brings together stakeholders with diversified backgrounds who share one common bond – to see the industry thrive through the development and deployment of innovation and what that means for a sustainable future.
place where things come together, the hub enables the convergence of three essential strengths for our sector’s future development and market alignment, namely: industry initiative and capital, innovative R&and engineering resources, and financial support from government partners. 
The innovation hub has been playing a key role in achieving a common vision of a Canadian forest products industry that powers Canada’s new economy by being green, innovative and open to the world, as well as a place to grow and prosper.
entertains a special collaboration with Forest Products Association of Canada (FPAC), its goals and vision. fully supports FPAC's vision 20/20.

The Forest Innovation by Research and Education—FIBRE— is an organization that was established in October 2011 to build synergies among eight university networks funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) that are part of the Forest Sector R&Initiative. As major partners of FPInnovations, these university networks have become key players within the forest sector innovation system to help transform the Canadian forestry sector. Their role in the training of highly qualified professionals is crucial at a time when the sector faces major workforce challenges. 
Of the eight networks under FIBRE, seven are strategic networks: ForValueNet Network and Value Chain Optimization Network (both led by Laval University); Bioconversion Network (led by University of Guelph and University of British Columbia); LignoWorks (led by University of British Columbia); Green Fibre Network (led 
by McGill University); Sentinel Bioactive Paper Network (led by McMaster University); and NEWBuild(led by University of New Brunswick). The eighth network, ArboraNano—the Canadian Forest NanoProducts Network—is a Business-led Centre of Excellence.
FIBRE���s mandate comes from a partnership comprised of FPInnovations, NRCan, NSERC, and the Forest Products Association of Canada (FPAC). 
Technical and business development support with First Nations communities continue to be a priority in FPInnovations’ efforts to build a viable and sustainable forestry sector across the country. 
Technical support has been on-going for many years, most notably in provinces such as where FPInnovations’ First Nations Technical Support Program has been working with numerous Aboriginal communities since 2006.
In other parts of the country such as Québec and Labrador, cooperation agreements between FPInnovations, the First Nations of Québec and Labrador and Forêt modèle du Lac-Saint-Jean have been signed. They are considered to be an important first step in the acquisition and the sharing of technical knowledge in the fields of forestry operations, silviculture, transportation, primary and secondary transformation, and bioenergy.
And in Saskatchewan, work has been done with Western Economic Diversification Canada and the Saskatchewan government to help Aboriginal peoples and communities in Saskatchewan improve entrepreneurial efforts necessary tor marketplace success.
hopes to build on its experience with aboriginal communities and continue to grow its business relationships with First Nations groups in need of technical expertise.

The Forest Innovation by Research and Education—FIBRE— is an organization that was established in October 2011 to build synergies among eight university networks funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) that are part of the Forest Sector R&Initiative. As major partners of FPInnovations, these university networks have become key players within the forest sector innovation system to help transform the Canadian forestry sector. Their role in the training of highly qualified professionals is crucial at a time when the sector faces major workforce challenges. 
Of the eight networks under FIBRE, seven are strategic networks: ForValueNet Network and Value Chain Optimization Network (both led by Laval University); Bioconversion Network (led by University of Guelph and University of British Columbia); LignoWorks (led by University of British Columbia); Green Fibre Network (led 
by McGill University); Sentinel Bioactive Paper Network (led by McMaster University); and NEWBuild(led by University of New Brunswick). The eighth network, ArboraNano—the Canadian Forest NanoProducts Network—is a Business-led Centre of Excellence.
FIBRE���s mandate comes from a partnership comprised of FPInnovations, NRCan, NSERC, and the Forest Products Association of Canada (FPAC). 
Technical and business development support with First Nations communities continue to be a priority in FPInnovations’ efforts to build a viable and sustainable forestry sector across the country. 
Technical support has been on-going for many years, most notably in provinces such as where FPInnovations’ First Nations Technical Support Program has been working with numerous Aboriginal communities since 2006.
In other parts of the country such as Québec and Labrador, cooperation agreements between FPInnovations, the First Nations of Québec and Labrador and Forêt modèle du Lac-Saint-Jean have been signed. They are considered to be an important first step in the acquisition and the sharing of technical knowledge in the fields of forestry operations, silviculture, transportation, primary and secondary transformation, and bioenergy.
And in Saskatchewan, work has been done with Western Economic Diversification Canada and the Saskatchewan government to help Aboriginal peoples and communities in Saskatchewan improve entrepreneurial efforts necessary tor marketplace success.
hopes to build on its experience with aboriginal communities and continue to grow its business relationships with First Nations groups in need of technical expertise.

It takes an enormous amount of energy to make pulp and paper products. According to Statistics Canada and Natural Resources Canada, the pulp and paper sector accounts for 25 per cent of the total industrial energy consumption, where energy is 20 to 25 per cent of the industry’s manufacturing cost*. As one of Canada’s most energy intensive manufacturing industries, pulp and paper producers have been searching for ways to use energy more efficiently. This makes sound business sense, while also having a significant positive impact on the environment.
Process Integration and Energy Management
Between 2012 and 2017, made great strides towards improving energy efficiency and reducing fossil fuel consumption in nearly all of its member company pulp and paper mills. Partnering with CanmetENERGY, a Natural Resources Canada research center specializing in energy optimization, the team examined 15 pulp and paper mills across Canada. The process integration methodology used takes a global approach to analyzing the consumption and production of energy across the entire facility. In the end, recommendations for projects providing potential energy cost savings of over
$50 million annually were delivered to the participating mills.
On-going follow up with the mills found that they readily implemented low complexity and no capital expenditure solutions, but did not always follow through with all of the recommended projects due to resource or knowledge constraints. Significant potential savings were being left on the table. In November of 2017, teamed up with Allnorth, a multi-discipline engineering and technical services company. Collaboration with Allnorth brings added value to members and customers by allowing them to apply the energy intelligence provides to them. “It’s an ideal marriage of complementary skills for a complete solution,” explained Enrique Mateos-Espejel, Scientist, Energy – Process Integration. “and Canmetcarry out energy analyses providing customized lists of energy optimization projects, while Allnorth can provide cost estimates and engineering and project management expertise for implementing investment projects.”
Putting the Partnership into Practice
An FPInnovations’ member company recently had an energy study prepared for them and selected a number of attractive projects that address key energy challenges they have been facing: cutting back energy and water consumption, reducing greenhouse gases, and maximizing profits from power exports. Having an identified energy savings of 1.9 GJ/t and water savings of 7.2 m3/t, these projects will require serious consideration and management. Where assistance is needed, the mill can now engage Allnorth for support with capital cost estimations and for the engineering design and overall management of those projects.
Long-term Planning
Impressive progress has been made by the pulp and paper industry to offset its significant energy consumption. Fuel costs have been reduced by sourcing approximately 55 to 60 per cent of mills’ energy from biomass* and energy efficiency improvements have drastically reduced the sector’s energy use. However, more is still required for the industry’s long-term global competitiveness and environmental impact. This collaboration supports FPInnovations’ approach to identifying energy management opportunities by enabling the delivery of integrated solutions to mills across North America. As confirmed by former FPInnovations’ President and CEO, Pierre Lapointe, “Our partnership with Allnorth gets those powerful solutions into even more peoples’ hands, which is good news for our industry and the environment.”

Take advantage of major energy saving opportunities and improve mill sustainability
How Can We Help You?
Let our high qualified team support you or set up an appointment.
FPInnovations’ unique approach towards process integration allows substantially improving energy efficiency.
The approach considers the changes in operating conditions and configuration of the process, process variability, fuel prices, steam costs, power contracts, and the complexity of the multiple system interactions that take place within the water, energy, and utility network. As part of the approach, we perform benchmarking (energy, water, and process operation) to compare your mills with others and also develop a process and utility simulation that will allow you to better see the full picture of your operations.
By applying this approach in several North American pulp and paper mills, was able to help each mill save $1 to 4 million per year. The end result is:
reduced production costs,
increase productivity by identifying opportunities for short and
long-term energy savings, increased power production profitability, and improved mill sustainability from three perspectives: economic, energy, and environmental.
