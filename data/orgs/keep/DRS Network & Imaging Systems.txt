The term “ethics” is commonly defined as a set of principles that govern a person’s or group’s behavior.  Ethical behavior has less to do with what may be required by law, and more to do with adherence to established standards of right and wrong that prescribe what a person or group ought to do in a given situation.  In other words, doing what is right because it is the right thing to do. 
Code of Business Ethics Conduct
At Leonardo DRS, our goal is not solely to comply with the laws that affect our business, but to abide by the highest level of ethical conduct in our business affairs.  We place the utmost importance upon our reputation for honesty, integrity and high standards.  Our core standards are set forth in the Leonardo Code of Business Ethics and Conduct (“Code”) as well as various policies that reaffirm the importance of these standards.  The Code and supporting policies should be viewed as the true expression of the Company’s philosophy and intent. 
At Leonardo DRS, this philosophy starts at the top and permeates every level of the Leonardo organization.  As an initial matter, the Company's Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the effective implementation and execution of our Ethics Program.  To this end, the Board has created an Audit Ethics Committee which has been delegated authority for oversight of the Company’s Ethics Program.
In addition, the Company’s management team is personally committed to the ideas, principles and procedures described in the Code and supporting policies.  Within each operating unit of the Company, the chief executive of the unit has the overall responsibility for implementing, monitoring and enforcing the tenets set forth in our Code and related policies. 
Finally, our standards of right and wrong are maintained through the actions and conduct of all Leonardo personnel.  Our employees know it is their obligation to conduct themselves in a manner that ensures the maintenance of these standards. Leonardo employees are responsible for ensuring that their own conduct, as well as the conduct of those who report to them, comply with the Company’s principles of right and wrong. 
Our hard-earned reputation for the highest standards of business conduct is of the greatest importance to Leonardo and its employees and vigilant compliance with these standards assures the continuance of Leonardo DRS's reputation for integrity and fair dealing.
The Ethics HelpLine is a confidential resource you can use to let us know about situations where you believe the Company may not have lived up to its stated standards for ethical conduct, or where you believe an issue or concern you have previously reported is not being properly addressed.
The Ethics HelpLine is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Telephone numbers for the HelpLine are shown to the right.
When you call the Ethics HelpLine, a trained staff member will take detailed notes and send a confidential report to  These calls are not recorded.  uses a third party who specializes in operating and maintaining confidential reporting systems.

As a leading technology company, Leonardo considers energy-efficient facility operations and innovations among our highest priorities. It is in our culture to help our planet alongside our customers.
Sustainable practices products
Leonardo practices what we preach, working tirelessly to consistently provide the most energy efficient products on the market. But that’s just where it starts. From recycling chemicals and scrap metals to using earth-friendly light fixtures and insulation, Leonardo teams go the extra mile to create cleaner facilities and to create the very best products for our customers
Providing 504,000 gallons of yearly fuel savings
Navy Secretary, Ray Mabus, has challenged the Navy to sail a green fleet by 2016. Leonardo is here to help them. The Leonardo Hybrid Electric Drive (HED) system is designed to provide propulsion power at lower speeds by integrating the permanent magnet motor with the ship’s main reduction gear. What does this mean? Savings of more than $3 billion over the life of 66 ships. Plus, carbon dioxide emission savings of approximately 10.7 billion pounds. Now that’s energy efficiency.
Using 28 percent less fuel
Introducing the XM1124 Hybrid-Electric (HE) With all the same speed and performance of the standard M1113 HMWWV, this advanced series hybrid can operate in all-electric mode for up to ten miles. Or, it can operate in hybrid mode, recharging for electric drive, or powering air conditioning and field hospitals — which not only saves fuel, but reduces the need for additional generator convoys.
Putting extra heat to good use
In keeping with the Army’s waste recycling initiatives, the Combined Heating and Air Conditioning Medium Mobile Power System (CHAMMPS) eliminates waste by turning it into renewable energy. Using the heat off its own engine, uniquely supplies heating, air conditioning and power all in one unit. And that’s not all. Soon, it will be even more efficient, utilizing solar and wind power to limit dependency on fossil fuels.
Cutting fuel convoy trips in half
In the areas surrounding the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, fuel convoys are popular targets for insurgent attack. Leonardo needed to find a way to stop them. Or better yet, stop the convoys. The Leonardo Module Fuel System (MFS) enables a 2500-gallon fuel truck to haul as much as 5000 gallons at one time — receiving, storing and distributing fuel at a fraction of the time. That means fewer trips. And fewer drivers lost at the hands of insurgents.
Eliminating the need for generator convoys
In order to preserve fuel and protect soldiers, Leonardo discovered a way to generate power more efficiently. On-Board Vehicle Power (OBVP) substitutes generator electricity with vehicle power, connecting to the transmission integral generator of many military vehicles. With power-producing capabilities ranging from 10kto more than 125kW, actually increases mission capabilities — all within minutes of arrival and with the help of one single operator.
Reducing bottled water shipping volume by 90 percent
Often, convoys are used to ship bottled water to soldiers. In fact, water comprises 60 percent of convoy content. Not only does this cost fuel, but it puts soldiers’ lives at risk. To reduce the need for water convoys, Leonardo developed the Expeditionary Water Packaging System (EWPS). This onsite solution can easily be transported and connected to any approved, potable water source — producing the bottled water that keeps our troops safe and hydrated. Without the risk.MISSION
Despite their diverse backgrounds, Leonardo employees all have one thing in common: they have built their careers — and their lives — serving our country, our employees and our customers.
