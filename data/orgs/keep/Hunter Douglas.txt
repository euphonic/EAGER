Giving back, one community at a time
Ronald McDonald House Charities
has long been a partner with the Ronald McDonald House Charity and recently became involved with Camp Ronald McDonald For Good Times which provides a recreational, medically supervised camp getaway for kids and their families while they are receiving cancer treatment. created a new program called Shades of Happiness which was a contest that involved the kids in being able to submit drawings that conveyed ‘happiness.’ The winning drawings were printed onto shades by our architectural products division and were placed on the windows in the camps dining hall. Watch the video to learn more about this wonderful program.
Habitat for Humanity
We are proud of our 25-year partnership with Habitat for Humanity, whose goal is to eliminate poverty housing and homelessness from the world, and to make decent shelter a matter of conscience and action. To date, we have donated close to 300,000 window coverings to low-income families, while our employees have invested thousands of hours of "sweat-equity" helping to build hundreds of these homes.
Memorial Sloan Kettering
We recently established the Fellowship in Breast Cancer Research at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. In underwriting the graduate fellowship with a donation of $250,000, we are investing in training students of proven accomplishments whose talent and commitment will lead beyond the Center to future breakthroughs and better treatments for patients and families around the world.
We also support other hospitals and healthcare facilities around the world with monetary contributions and window covering donations to create a more comfortable and comforting setting for patients.
We participate in disaster relief efforts that provide critical assistance in times of tragedy. Examples include substantial donations to organizations aiding in the recovery and relief of those impacted by Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines and the devastating floods in Colorado. Our donations are often supplemented by and made even more substantial by the broad support of our own employees.
We provide financial assistance for educational opportunities for our staff and their families as well as needy members of our communities.
Contributing to many other worthy organizations, such as:
