Start PageSample to InsightWhat attracts a talented individual to a global company? Many would say it's the corporate culture and work environment that make all the difference.
There is more to QIAGEN, of course, than facts and figures, markets and customers, products and production. Team enthusiasm and a collaborative spirit are a strong part of our corporate culture and identity. In a congenial environment like ours, the exchange of ideas can take place anywhere – not just during a team meeting, for example – but at lunch, over a coffee, or even waiting for the elevator. Surrounded by inspired and like-minded colleagues, inspiration could strike anytime. 
Dr. Annette Koch, Chief Human Resources Officer, describes the unique culture at QIAGEN: “What is really great about – beyond our products and our impact on innovation in science and medicine – is the working environment. We work in very international, collaborative teams of highly passionate and skilled colleagues, inspired by our Company mission to make improvements in life possible. We strive for a culture that focuses on the outcome and that values diversity of thought and experience. There is lots of opportunity for personal growth. We have a high level of respect for each other and a commitment to performance and personal integrity. It is fun and rewarding to work at QIAGEN."
Collaborative, cross-culture & global organization
Time and again, when we speak with our employees at sites across the globe, we hear about the engaging and collaborative environment that helps making not only a successful company but a great place to work.
“enjoy the freedom I'm given to make informed decisions and steer my products.” 
Divya vijay pratheek, global product manager 
With more than 35 sites in 25 countries, we have grown to be truly global, having rapidly expanded from our flagship site in Hilden, Germany to countries and cultures across the globe. None of this growth would have been possible without the tremendous collaborative spirit that we have fostered from the beginning.
Without a global vision from the start, becoming a worldwide market leader would have been out of reach. desire to embrace the various styles of communicating and doing business around the world has led to company success and customer satisfaction across the globe.
"My colleagues make the working environment enriching and enjoyable."
Alvin Lee, Associate Director QuantiMarket Development - Asia-Pacific
Diversity and inclusion make our teams strong
Based on the philosophy that "diversity strengthens us as an organization," our leaders actively strive to promote and implement diversity at all levels. Not only does diversity make a better place to work, it is a key success factor on the path to achieving our mission and goals.
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion
We are committed to continue creating an environment where all individuals have the opportunity to grow and contribute to our progress, regardless of their age, educational background, gender, nationality, physical abilities, race and ethical background, religion, or sexual orientation.
Diverse individuals make better teams
Teams strengthen our organization through the richness of their ideas and opinions. Furthermore, teams outperform and succeed when they are composed of individuals with the widest possible range of personalities, backgrounds, and traits.
Our individuals and teams promote diversity
Sample to InsightFrom university spin-off to global leader in three decades
was founded by a team of scientists from Heinrich Heine University in Düsseldorf, Germany, in 1984. Within two years they launched a new method of obtaining genetic material from cells for further analysis that was much easier to use, faster and more reliable than previous methods. This ready-to-use kit reduced processing time from several days to a few hours. This enabled molecular biology processes to be conducted in laboratories all over the world, and not just in universities. Since then, has never stopped growing through the development of new sample and assay technologies.
That small team of university scientists has now grown into a global workforce of more than 4,700. Our global headquarters is in Venlo, The Netherlands, and we have over 35 subsidiaries in more than 20 countries and sales offices in 70 countries. With more than 500 products in our portfolio, we market a broad range of consumables and instruments to meet the varied needs of over 500,000 customers across a variety of markets in healthcare and the life sciences. Our success is based, not least, on the fact that we invest around 10% of our sales in R&to continuously drive innovation and growth.

As an entrepreneurial spin-off of university research, created a simpler, safer way for laboratories to handle the painstaking tasks of preparing samples to explore the mysteries of Since then, we have expanded across the continuum of molecular testing to establish as a global leader in rapidly growing fields of molecular diagnostics and life sciences. 
Today some 4,700 employees, based in more than 25 countries, provide expertise and service to customers nearly everywhere. Our people share a collaborative, truly global culture – plus a commitment to making improvements in life possible.

Peer Schatz Material non-financial information
For guidance on materiality and non-financial disclosures, we base our non-financial reporting on the international standards of the Global Reporting Initiative (Standards, 2016) as well as on the sustainability accounting standards for Medical Equipment and Supplies and Biotechnology of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB).
To identify the relevant information, we have conducted a systematic materiality analysis in 2016. For each thematic aspect (environmental, social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and bribery) we identified a series of topics that possess high business relevance, highly influence the decisions of our stakeholders and where QIAGEN’s activities have significant impact on the thematic aspects. In a joint workshop with representatives from our different departments, the various perspectives had been assessed and discussed. The final list had been validated by our senior management and resulted in twelve material topics:
Environmental matters: energy consumption, emissions
Employee matters: training, diversity, employee satisfaction, employee retention
Social matters: quality and product safety, customer satisfaction, access to medicine
Anti-corruption and bribery matters: anti-trust, anti-corruption
