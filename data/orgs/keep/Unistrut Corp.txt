The system is flexible, adaptable and versatile. Our parts can be dismantled and used again and again for infinite configurations.
If a change of plans or requirements calls for alteration or rebuilding, you simply loosen the bolt and relocate the channel nut in any desired position. The Channel Nut may be positioned any place along the “slot” of the channel.
The Connection is Quick and Easy
