 - The Original Metal Framing System 
 leads the industry with the most comprehensive line of channels and fittings, along with a complete line of hangers, pipe clamps, concrete inserts, and accessories, in a variety of finishes and materials. Backed by a worldwide network of engineering and distribution centers, is the number one choice for all your metal framing needs.
connections provide the strength of welding but can easily be taken apart. The nut is designed so that normal pressure in installing it causes the nut to bite into and lock itself securely o the channel.
has channel options available with continuous slots to eliminate drilling. At points where attachment of another framing member is desired, the nut is inserted, slid to desired position and tightly bolted to fitting.
100% Reusable 
The system is flexible, adaptable and versatile. Our parts can be dismantled and used again and again for infinite configurations.
100% Adjustable 
If a change of plans or requirements calls for alteration or rebuilding, you simply loosen the bolt and relocate the channel nut in any desired position. The Channel Nut may be positioned any place along the “slot” of the channel.
The Connection is Quick and Easy
    is proud of the exacting standards of research, design, engineering and manufacturing that go into the production of the system. Maximum recommended load ratings for channels have been established through testing and are based on allowable stresses applicable to the Material Specification. Many products are listed by the Underwriters’ Laboratories, Inc. and certified by the Canadian Standards Association.
