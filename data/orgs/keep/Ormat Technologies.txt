NATURE’DECADES.
was established in 1965 by the Bronicki family, who shared a bold vision to export breakthrough technology in the renewable energy sector.
At that time, was primarily known as a pioneer of proprietary turbine designs, capable of generating electricity from low enthalpy energy resources. In its early years, focused exclusively on manufacturing power generation equipment.
In the 1970s, expanded its technology and expertise in the Remote Power Unit (RPU) sector, providing RPUs for clients requiring reliable power generation in remote operating conditions. One of Ormat’s first clients was the Trans-Alaska Pipeline project.
In the 1980s and throughout the 1990s, focused its growing renewable energy expertise on the geothermal industry. We developed Wabuska, a 2 geothermal power plant in Nevada, USA; our very first geothermal facility. This was followed in rapid succession by a series of major geothermal power plant acquisitions and developments, largely concentrated in Nevada and California, USA, which vaulted into the position of that country’s second largest geothermal power producer. The Integrated Two-Level Unit (ITLU) was a vital development in maximizing the thermodynamic efficiencies of lower-temperature resources. The patented design revolutionized the industry and, to this day, separates from the rest.
In 1982, developed the Solar Pond Power Plant – an experimental project to pilot the development of solar energy production.
Throughout the 1980s, developed its state-of-the-art Recovered Energy Generation (REG) power plant solutions, which utilize waste heat to create power, fully exploiting the energy potential found in different industrial processes, or gas compressor stations – converting unused heat into clean, emission-free, fuel-free electricity.
The 1990s were focused on positioning ourselves as a developer of geothermal power plants through technological advancement and continued supply of equipment worldwide. The first development was the 50 Leyte Optimization project in the Philippines under a for 10 years starting in 1998. The inception of the Olkaria complex with the 8 early generation in Kenya was the first stage in what is now a 140 complex.
In the 2000s we continued to grow in geothermal through the acquisition of geothermal assets in the US, increasing the total plants sold and reaching a total of 1300 in plants sold in 2010.
In 2004, completed an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange (ORA). Headquartered in Reno, Nevada, this transition to a public company enabled continued growth, expansion of our capabilities and the opportunity to participate in a wider variety of global power projects.
Through every decade, has continued to make major strides forward in the geothermal energy and recovered energy industries.  In the past several years, we’ve continued pursuing innovation in energy management, storage and demand response solutions; fields where we again show our strength as a vertically integrated solution provider.
Sbegan, our strong values have guided and shaped the way we work, our relationships with employees, clients, communities and other stakeholders, and the level of professionalism and spirit of innovation that accompanies every renewable power product and service we offer.
As a developer, operator and manufacturer of geothermal energy and recovered energy equipment, understands customer needs and creates field-proven solutions. Albert Einstein said, “The only source of knowledge is experience.” Our vast experience and constant feedback through both in-house and industry operations and applications has given us a full tool belt that our competitors don’t have.
Renewable energy and a vision for a cleaner, sustainable future have taken us this far – and we believe that our vision, capabilities and expertise will enable to flourish for ge­­nerations.

is an earth-first company.
We’ve been capturing the power of sustainable thinking from the start – by applying our ingenuity to create a future where natural energy sources, like geothermal and solar, and smart solutions, like recovered energy generation, deliver peace of mind and make a difference.
We apply the world’s most advanced recovery to harness the power contained in the geothermal fluids that flow in the molten interior of the earth’s crust. We convert earth-bound energy from heat to electrical energy, while preserving the integrity and prolonging the lifecycles of the geothermal reservoirs we drill. Geothermal energy provides base load electricity 24/7. It’s highly reliable, produces no NOx emissions and virtually no CO2 emissions.
Recovered energy generation is another critical part of our sustainable energy portfolio – a sector that provides vital, self-generating power, which produces electricity with zero emissions and without added fuel consumption.
All of these energy options do not involve the production or burning of fossil fuels and, in fact, encourage a future where fossil fuels are no longer necessary. We are working to ensure that remains at the forefront of the renewable energy sector, because we see a fossil-free future on the horizon.
At Ormat, we go beyond renewable energy development. We believe in the power of positive thinking and action. In every geography in which we operate, we seek to become part of the community, creating positive working relationships with local stakeholders and welcoming them to our facilities – so they can learn more about renewable energy.
also recognizes that every community in which we operate should benefit from our presence. That’s why we give back to local not-for-profit and charitable organizations, contributing to local health, wellness and educational causes that strengthen potential and encourage and promote positive long-term outcomes.
