Laying the foundations now for future generations
Severin Schwan explains what ‘sustainability’ means for Roche.
Severin Schwan on Access Accelerated
Our is very excited about this initiative.
We asked Severin Schwan what he thinks about the following topics:
What inspires him:
“This is what really inspires me about Roche: the impact we can make on people’s lives.”
How to foster innovation:
“Scientific success cannot be programmed, but we can create the conditions that will allow it to happen: we need to be open to new ideas, and to have the courage to take risks and challenge commonly-held views once in a while; our researchers need to have the freedom to work on their ideas and above all, they need plenty of time and staying power.”
What makes him proud:
“We are seeing a revolution in cancer treatment. By mobilising the body’s own immune system, we may be able to better treat cancer than ever before. am proud that is part of this revolution.”
How he copes with stress:
“In fact the ‘normal’ pressures only turn into stress if you have the feeling that the world will stop turning if you’re not around. But of course the world keeps on turning. If you don’t overestimate your own importance, then that helps you to do your job effectively.”
The courage to fail:
“There’s no success without failure! When you’re pursuing ground-breaking innovations, setbacks go with the territory – nine out of ten innovation projects fail. Unless you have the courage to fail, you’ll never be successful.
It is my strong belief that we should celebrate our failures just as we celebrate our successes. personally congratulate all participants and thank them for their hard work – because innovation is about taking risks and accepting failure.” 
Access to healthcare:
“Our aim at is for every person who needs our medicines to be able to access them, no matter where they live. am proud that we at are now at the stage where we have a differentiated pricing strategy in different countries, based on purchasing power. Solidarity between the rich and poor countries is essential if we are to improve access to innovative drugs.”

The founder of Roche, Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, was a pioneering entrepreneur who was convinced that the future belonged to branded pharmaceutical products.
The founding year – first successes
Hoffmann-La & Co. was founded at a time when industrial revolution was changing the face of Europe. On October 1, 1896, at the age of 28, Fritz Hoffmann-La launched his company as the successor company to Hoffmann, Traub & Co in Basel, Switzerland. He was among the first to recognise that the industrial manufacture of medicines would be a major advance in the fight against disease. Since then, has grown into one of the world's leading healthcare companies.
Pharmacist Carl Schaerges, the first head of research, together with chemist Emil Barell demonstrate the presence of iodine in thyroid extracts. This results in Roche’s first patent and scientific publications. The launch of Aiodin marks the earliest in a series of thyroid preparations by Roche.
High hopes for wound antiseptic
launches Airol, a wound antiseptic originally developed by Hoffmann, Traub & Co. The young company has high hopes for Airol on the German market. buys land in the nearby German farming community of Grenzach and builds a small factory to produce Airol.
soon expands its business activities. From 1897 to 1910, the factory in Grenzach, Germany, is enlarged and the lion’s share of manufacturing moves there. Fritz Hoffmann-La and his new partner Carl Meerwein waste little time in building a network of European and overseas agents and subsidiaries. By 1914 has offices in Milan, New York, St. Petersburg, and London, among others.
Orange-flavoured success
produces a non-prescription cough syrup containing its own active ingredient, Thiocol. The orange-flavoured syrup is an almost immediate success. Launched under the trademark Sirolin in 1898, the syrup remains on the market for over 60 years.
With assistance from Roche, Max Cloëtta produces a pure, standardised digitalis preparation containing all the cardiac glycosides of the purple fox-glove leaf. The preparation is free of unnecessary ingredients and displays a uniform efficacy. launches the preparation under the trademark Digalen in 1904. Digalen proves to be exactly what the medical profession has been looking for – it stays on the market until 1964.
The analgesic and hypnotic Pantopon (1909) and Sedobrol (1912), a drug for epilepsy and nervous disorders, are also released as grows and expands its portfolio.
Cooperation against pain
Hermann Sahli, head of the medical department at the University Hospital in Bern, contacts research director Carl Schaerges. Sahli proposes a combination of all opium alkaloids that offers advantages over the individual compounds. Discussions with Sahli and extensive studies done under Schaerges result in the analgesic Pantopon, which is launched in 1909.
Corporate Development
From 1897 to 1914 expands worldwide, employing more than 700 people in Basel, Grenzach, Milan, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, St. Petersburg, London, New York and Yokohama. During this period, strives for strong cooperation between academic circles and commercial  developers. Until 1915, all innovations result from such cooperation.
The time of crisis
The First World War has devastating repercussions for Roche. The German boycott of its products, Basel’s isolation from its plant in Grenzach, Germany, the loss of the company’s Russian market and assets in the revolution of 1917, and sizeable foreign exchange losses combine to create a financial crisis. In response, is transformed legally into a limited company. Additionally, bemoans the death of founding father and visionary Fritz Hoffmann in 1920. glimmer of hope arises with the classic study by Markus Guggenheim of biogenic amines, which enhances Roche’s standing in the scientific community.
People of Fritz Hoffmann dies
Founding father Fritz Hoffmann dies of kidney disease on 18 April 1920, depriving of a dynamic entrepreneur and a striking individual. “At every step it was [Fritz Hoffmann] who determined the company’s direction, guiding it to bigger and better things with his vision, restless energy, infectious spontaneity and indomitable optimism,” said Emil Barell in a eulogy for Hoffmann. Barell becomes the new Chief Executive.
People of First steps towards synthetic vitamins
Markus Guggenheim publishes a classic study of biogenic amines in 1920. begins marketing what it calls biochemicals. These include amino acids, peptides, proteins, cardiac glycosides, vitamins and hormones – all substances that the company originally produced for its own research projects. The biochemicals enhance Roche’s standing in the scientific community. In 1927 Guggenheim begins studying vitamin B1. His investigations include work with extracts of rice bran, which will ultimately contribute to the synthesis and production of vitamin B1 at Roche.
Pension fund for employees
1921 sees the creation of the “Beamten- und Arbeiterpensionskasse Roche”, a pension fund for office and factory staff. The occasion is Roche’s 25th anniversary. In addition, Chief Executive Emil Barell personally endows a special fund to provide gifts to employees who have completed 25 years of service.
People of Roche’s first woman executive
Alice Keller, a 30-year-old native of Basel, boards ship to Japan in 1926. Phgraduate in political economics she has worked at Basel for about a year before accepting a post in Tokyo, where the company formed a subsidiary in 1925. She starts as a kind of girl Friday, handling correspondence, revising documents and doing some of the billing and costing. When she returns in 1939, Keller has risen to the senior executive ranks of Direktorin – a sensational achievement for the times.
Strengthening of synthetic production
Allonal is introduced in 1920. The analgesic sedative and hypnotic drug is the first product to use compounds produced by synthetic chemistry. An industrial laboratory is built in Basel to develop synthetic processes.
Vitamin boost overcomes the crisis
managed to overcome the crisis under the leadership of chairman Emil Barell. The company experienced an unexpected upsurge spurred by its vitamin production, which made the return to former prosperity possible. is able to expand once more and starts its strong commitment to the US-American market with first investments in New York and Nutley.
Corporate Development
Investment in the USA
outgrows its New York offices, prompting the development of a new plant in Nutley to manufacture a wide range of products. Soon after the move to Nutley in 1929, the list of products manufactured locally includes barbiturates such as Allonal.
Corporate Development
In Basel, work proceeds on a new administration building designed by architect Otto Salvisberg. native of Bern, Salvisberg has already made a name for himself with several projects in Berlin. Completed in 1935, the elegant simplicity of administrative Building 21 is impressive even today.
Success story for vitamins
Tadeusz Reichstein (Nobel Prize winner 1950) offers a workable method of synthesising vitamin year later the first 50 kilograms of vitamin are produced, marking the start of vitamin manufacturing at Roche. The first vitamin preparation, Redoxon, is launched.
becomes the leading supplier of vitamins, having also mastered the industrial synthesis of vitamin A, B1, B2, and K1. By 1938, vitamins are the company’s mainstay, encompassing Benerva (vitamin B1), Nestrovit (multi-vitamin), Beflavin (vitamin B2) and Ephynal (vitamin E).
Streamlining and improving production
Vitamin output increases and new production locations strengthen Roche’s position as one of the main producers of vitamins. To avoid a strong dependency on vitamins, intensifies pharmaceutical research. Between the early 1950s and mid-1960s pharmaceutical research is extremely diverse, with a portfolio of pharmaceuticals ranging from antidepressants and antimicrobials to agents for cancer chemotherapy. During this period, Roche’s researchers discover a compound of the benzodiazepine class that sedates without causing drowsiness.
Corporate Development
In 1945 establishes Pantene Corporation and affiliate cosmetic companies. The companies employ 4,000 – 1,200 alone in Basel and 2,000 in Nutley, USA.
Tranquilliser production starts
In the mid-1950s a new group of sedatives, known as tranquillisers, is introduced into clinical use. Returning to a group of compounds he has worked on previously, Leo Sternbach chances upon benzodiazepines. One of them, Ro 5-0690, later launches as Librium. Tranquillisers soon become one of Roche’s most important product segments. This success, combined with a push to streamline vitamin production, fuels a period of unprecedented growth.
First anti-cancer drug
introduces its first anti-cancer drug, Fluorouracil, in 1962. The drug paves the way for Roche’s activities in the field of cancer chemotherapy.
Valium a therapeutic success
Valium Roche, a sedative and anxiolytic drug belonging to the benzodiazepine family, launches in 1963. Valium will prove a huge therapeutic success, enabling to build a worldwide reputation in psychotropic medications.
Corporate Development
In 1963 acquires Givaudan S.A., a leading manufacturer of fragrances and flavours. Givaudan is a longstanding customer for intermediates from Roche’s vitamin production. also acquires renowned French fragrance company Roure Bertrand Dupont in 1964. By 1965, employs 19,000 people worldwide, compared with only 7,000 in 1953, and continues to form new subsidiaries around the globe, e.g. in India and Mexico.
Propelled by the success of the benzodiazepines, diversifies across the entire spectrum of healthcare. In Switzerland and the United States, bioelectronics departments are set up to develop electronic medical instruments. Rocom and Medicovision are the company’s forays into medical publishing. The acquisition of Dr. Maag AG, a plant protection company, reflects Roche’s growing involvement in agrochemicals. In Nutley, USA, a new diagnostics department is established.
This period also marks the start of Roche’s involvement in basic biomedical research. The company establishes the Institute of Biology in Nutley, the Basel Institute for Immunology and the Nippon Research Center in Kamakura, Japan. chemical accident at an Italian subsidiary is a major setback.
Corporate Development
enters diagnostics market
The creation in 1968 of a department for diagnostic products marks Roche’s entry into a new sector. Apart from developing new diagnostic tests and automatic analysers, objectives include setting up service laboratories to perform clinical analyses for hospitals and office-based physicians.
Corporate Development
Research institutes established internationally
The Institute of Biology opens in 1968 in Nutley. It is one of Roche’s first research and development centres. year later, opens the Basel Institute for Immunology. The first director is Niels Kaj Jerne, who later receives a Nobel Prize for medicine.
Prix Galien
The anti-Parkinson drug Madopar wins the Prix Galien (1974), a prize created in France to honour innovative and valuable advances in drug therapy. This is the first of a series of prizes for therapeutics that have become milestones in drug therapy, as well as the first of 27 awards for other products.
runaway chemical reaction occurs in 1976 at a plant operated by a subsidiary in Seveso, Italy. An aerosol cloud containing a mixture of dioxin and other chemicals escapes from the factory, contaminating Seveso and several neighbouring communities. From the beginning makes every effort to redress the damage, including assisting authorities in dealing with the after-effects of the disaster.
begins to tighten its organisational structure and moves towards creating separate business units. Additionally, corporate activities are consolidated through acquisitions and divestments. After the corporate realignment, operates with four core business divisions: pharmaceuticals, vitamins and fine chemicals, diagnostics, and flavours and fragrances.
Corporate Development
Leap forward in cancer therapy
In 1980 at the Institute of Biology, a pure interferon alfa is isolated. Nutley and Genentech, a biotech company based in South San Francisco, begin a joint project to produce a genetically engineered version of the substance.
Launch of Rocephin
Rocephin, an antibiotic of the cephalosporin class, is launched in 1982 in Switzerland only four years after its discovery. By 1987 Rocephin outsells all other products. The Diagnostics Division releases the Cobas Bio/Mira random access biochemistry analyser. Roferon-A, Roche’s first genetically engineered drug, enters the market.
People of Nobel prizes
Niels Kaj Jerne, the first director of the Basel Institute of Immunology, is awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine (1984) for his seminal work in immunology. The award is shared with César Milstein and Georges Köhler, co-discoverers of monoclonal antibodies.
Susumu Tonegawa, a researcher at the Basel Institute for Immunology from 1972 to 1981, is awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine (1987) for his work on antibody gene segments. His fundamental discoveries later make possible the production of humanised antibodies.
Corporate Development
The corporate structure introduced in 1986 is extended and reinforced, preparing the way for separate operating divisions in 1990. The changes involve the formation of a holding company (Holding AG), parallel to an increase in nominal share capital and in the number of bearer shares. The new structure gives access to international capital markets.
International expansion and innovative developments
Through its commitment to research and innovation, continues to make steady advances in drug therapy that will replace more expansive treatments and shorten hospital stays.
Corporate Development
acquires the worldwide marketing rights to the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from Cetus Corporation in 1991. Capable of detecting minute amounts of genetic material, the technique opens the way to developing diagnostic tests that are fast, sensitive and specific for a broad spectrum of medical and research uses.
drugs tackle and cancer – part 1
series of innovative drugs for cancer treatment are developed starting in the mid-90s: Herceptin, a novel treatment for metastatic breast cancer, is a humanised antibody designed to target and block the function of HER2, a protein produced by a specific gene with cancer-causing potential. MabThera increases the time patients with the most common form of adult leukaemia live without their cancer progressing.
drugs tackle and cancer - part 2
Invirase, the first HIV-protease inhibitor is launched and wins the Prix Galien in 1999. Valcyte and Fuzeon are released, the first of the new class of fusion inhibitors aimed at treating Fuzeon blocks the virus from entering the human immune cell, preventing replication that can devastate the immune of HIV-infected individuals (awarded Prix Galien in 2004).
The Diagnostics Division launches a series of products in the mid-1990s in all areas of medical testing: Cobas Integra, a clinical chemistry and immunochemistry analyzer; Cobas Core II, an immunochemistry analyzer; Cobas Amplicor, an analyser based on technology; and Accutrend and Accu-Chek, an innovative product line that offers more convenient diabetes management and virtually pain-free testing for diabetics.
Tamiflu (oseltamivir), a prescription drug, is an oral antiviral treatment, not a vaccine, for influenza. It belongs to a class of medicines called neuraminidase inhibitors. These medicines prevent the influenza virus from spreading inside the body and are designed to be active against all clinically relevant influenza virus strains. Released in 1999, Tamiflu can be used both for prevention and treatment of influenza.
Corporate Development
Syntex joins the Group
strengthens its position in international and pharmaceutical markets in 1994 by acquiring Palo Alto-based Syntex Corporation. The takeover continues Roche’s strategy of concentrating on its core business. In 1995 Syntex becomes Bioscience, one of the Group’s major research and development sites.
Corporate Development
Acquisitions increase diversification
With the acquisition in 1998 of Boehringer Mannheim, became the world leader in diagnostic markets for its unique range of innovative products, depth and breadth of technologies and overall geographical presence. The purchase in 1991 of Nicholas, a producer of non-prescription medicines, strengthens Roche’s portfolio of over-the-counter medicines, an increasingly important area because of the growing trend towards self-medication. Nicholas will later be integrated into Roche’s Consumer Health division.
Corporate Development
New research institutions
The International Clinical Research Centre opens in Strasbourg, France. It is responsible for conducting clinical trials and preparing international regulatory filings in several therapeutic areas. Penzberg, Germany, one of Roche’s main research and development sites increases capacity with by opening a new research building in 1998. After many successful years, the Basel Institute for Immunology shifts its focus to genetics as a basis for understanding gene functions and the role of genes in disease.
The healthcare “miracle” train
Referred to by locals as a miracle train, the Transnet-Phelophepa healthcare train provides medical, dental and psychiatric services and brings basic healthcare and health education to poor communities in remote parts of South Africa. Just three coaches long in 1994, it has developed into the 600-ton, 16-coach train that it is today. The huge success of the project, which has been supporting from the outset, prompted the decision to launch a second train, Phelophepa II, in 2012.
Company restructures to focus on biotech
ranks among the world’s leading healthcare companies with its expertise in two core businesses – Diagnostics and Pharmaceuticals. Combined with its strength in biotechnology, the company paves the way to the future of healthcare with innovations in areas such as personalised healthcare.
Corporate Development
Focus on two core businesses
To intensify its focus on healthcare, divests two businesses: fragrances and flavours, and vitamins and fine chemicals. As a research-driven company committed to innovation, the Group’s Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics Divisions supply products spanning the healthcare spectrum, from the early detection and prevention of disease to diagnosis and treatment. Combining the strengths and expertise of both divisions, plays an increasingly important role in shaping the future of medicine by contributing to the personalised healthcare approach.

We asked Christoph Franz what he thinks about the following topics:
"The values that my wife and are passing on to our five children can be summed up with the phrase ‘Do unto others as you would have them do unto you’. This includes respecting your fellow humans, fairness and a sense of shared responsibility for society."
His professional ambition:
"My professional ambition has never been focused on how many stars there are on my shoulder. The enjoyment of taking on exciting tasks and responsibilities has always been my main priority."
Role models:
"am a firm believer in the concept of role models as a leadership tool. Employees pay close attention to their managers’ behaviour. They have a feel for whether or not the managers practise what they preach."
Giving people space:
"Innovation means exploring new, unknown avenues. You can only make new discoveries if you do things everyone thinks are impossible. We need to create space for people who are a bit ‘crazy’, as it were!"
His management style:
"My management style is very dialogue-oriented. enjoy working with people and sharing ideas as a way of discovering different perspectives on a topic."
Access to medical care:
"Even the most ground-breaking innovation is useless if it never reaches the patients. We need to ensure that everyone receives our diagnostic solutions and medicines – regardless of where they were born or live and their purchasing power."
Personalised healthcare:
"am very optimistic about the future. We have an outstanding pipeline and – thanks to the interplay of pharma and diagnostics – very good opportunities to advance personalised healthcare."
Our Business Priorities
We believe in the importance of having a clear set of priorities to guide us through a turbulent and ever-changing environment. Our aim is to achieve long term sustainable growth and deliver value to all our stakeholders.
Focus on patients
We focus on developing innovative medicines and diagnostic tests that help patients live longer, better lives. Two-thirds of all diseases are either still not treated adequately or not treated at all. This medical need is enormous and better diagnostics and medicines can make a huge difference to the lives of millions of patients and their families.
Excellence in science
We strive to address unmet medical needs through excellence in science. Breakthroughs in science and technology increasingly allow us to find out precisely what is malfunctioning in the body and develop drugs to counter the problem. We focus on oncology, immunology, ophthalmology, infectious diseases and neuroscience, however we remain flexible and follow the science as new insights become available.
Personalised Healthcare
We combine our strengths in pharmaceuticals and diagnostics to better fit treatments to patients. When genetic differences can be identified, the efficacy and safety of medicines can be improved enormously. To this end we have a companion diagnostic strategy for every molecule we develop.
Access to healthcare
We aim to bring our medicines and diagnostic tests to as many people in need as possible. Every healthcare system comes with different challenges and we customise solutions for individual markets. We work with many different local partners to reduce barriers to accessing healthcare and establish innovative, sustainable ways to bring effective and affordable healthcare to patients.
We are committed to constantly strengthening and maintaining an excellent workplace where every person feels valued and respected and can grow to his or her full potential. Our people make our business. They discover, develop and manufacture our products and ensure they reach the patients who need them. We believe that the key to our success lies in our ability to attract, retain and motivate a highly skilled and diverse workforce.
We run our business in a way that is ethical and aims to create long-term value for all stakeholders.  We want to create value through developing medical solutions and we aim for as many people to benefit from them as possible. We believe that our success lies in our ability to develop strategies where both industry and society benefit in a sustainable way.
is committed to serving all its stakeholders. As a basis for the successful implementation of this commitment our Corporate Governance principles accordingly put the focus of our business activities on sustainable value creation and innovation and prescribe a management culture conforming to recognised standards of good corporate governance and a policy of transparent communication.
The  Board of Directors  represents the Group's owners (its shareholders and the holders of non-voting equity securities). It is responsible for the successful long-term management of the Group and therefore makes the strategic decisions and decides the structure of the business. In order to perform its role as efficiently as possible, the Board of Directors appoints four  board committees , each of which has a specific remit.
The Board of Directors assigns responsibility for the operational management of the company – i.e. all specific short to medium-term measures – to the  Corporate Executive Committee . Consequently, the Corporate Executive Committee is also appointed and monitored by the Board of Directors.
As a body, the Corporate Executive Committee deals solely with operational matters that affect all divisions and functions – i.e. the company as a whole. The individual members of the Corporate Executive Committee, however, carry out all managerial tasks in relation to their individual business area (division or function).
This clear separation is set out in the  Bylaws of Holding Ltd , and is consistent with the directives for Swiss companies and relevant statutory norms of the Swiss Code of Obligations. 
The Group meets all of the requirements with respect to Corporate Governance complying with the existing legal regulations, the (Swiss stock exchange) directives and the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corporate Governance as promulgated by the Swiss business federation ‘economiesuisse’.
The existing internal foundations, specifically the  Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws , take account of all principles required for the management and supervision of the company to ensure strong corporate governance, including the requisite checks and balances.

Our business priorities
Meet our Chairman
Meet our CEO
We focus on finding new medicines and diagnostics that help patients live longer, better lives and evolve the practice of medicine.
We are guided by our purpose: Doing now what patients need next. Our company has a 120-year history of advancing the field of medicine and bringing novel treatments and diagnostics to patients. The patient is and will remain at the core of what we do, the reason we come to work every day.
Our focus is on fitting treatments to patients: providing the right therapy for the right group of people at the right time. With our in-house combination of Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics, we are uniquely positioned to deliver personalised healthcare. We are developing our internal capabilities and building strategic partnerships ready for the next stage in personalised healthcare: to combine insights from multiple data sources with sophisticated analytics to drive more effective and efficient research and allow for better therapeutic decisions for patients. Access to our products is also a critical part of our strategy. Our detailed access plans are embedded into the business at a local level.
We will continue to concentrate our energies entirely on prescription medicines and in vitro diagnostics, rather than diversify into other sectors like generics and biosimilars, over-the-counter medicines and medical devices. 
In our pursuit of excellence in science, our distinctiveness rests on four key elements: an exceptionally broad and deep understanding of biology, the seamless integration of our pharmaceuticals and diagnostics capabilities, a diversity of approaches to maximise innovation, and a long-term orientation. 
Our delivery
Our delivery is to create value for all our stakeholders: being a partner of choice; bringing significant medical benefit for patients, doctors and payers; offering a great place to work for employees; having a sustainable impact on society; and creating top-quartile total shareholder return for our investors. 
In the end, it takes people with integrity, courage and passion to make a difference for patients. It is our people who are proud to say: We are Roche. We embrace the diversity of cultures and people across the Group. We are inclusive and encourage the richness of ideas and approaches this brings. 
Our decision-making principles and processes emphasise transparent dialogue, clear accountability, and encourage a high degree of empowerment.
Our structure is built for innovation. Our autonomous research and development centres and alliances with over 200 external partners foster diversity and agility. Our global geographical scale and reach enables us to bring our diagnostics and medicines quickly to people who need them.

Fostering a compliance culture
All employees and all others acting on behalf of must comply with the Group Code of Conduct, regardless of their location and the nature of their work. Also, following the “One Approach” principle, the set forth standards are equally binding for Group Functions, the Pharmaceutical and the Diagnostics Division.
The Group Code of Conduct is built on the Corporate Principles and the Values. The code contains guidance in the areas of products and services, personal integrity, corporate integrity, employment, company assets, responsible business and comprehensive compliance management. It also provides questions and answers, examples and information on where to find more detailed guidance on the various topics.

Also on local level, Affiliates are often member of the local associations, as for example interpharma, scienceindustries, Advamed US, Advamed China.
Anyone who becomes aware of a potential violation of the Group Code of Conduct can and should bring it to the attention of their line manager or supervisor, to the local Compliance Officer or the Chief Compliance Officer (Urs Jaisli, direct phone number: +41(0) 61 688 40 18).
employees can also use the following reporting channels:
The Group Code of Conduct Help & Advice Line in case of compliance questions or uncertainties
The Group Speak Up Line to report in good faith a suspected violation, including a person they believe has done, is doing or may be about to do something that violates the Group Code of Conduct. Launched in 2009, the system comprises a web and telephone service that enables employees to report compliance concerns confidentially and anonymously. The SpeakUp Line operates in 103 countries and 53 languages, making it available to over 80,000 employees.  All reports will be treated as confidential and the reporting employees will not be penalised by the company for doing so, however, they are not immune from prosecution for legal violations.

Our Business Ethics Incident Reporting (BEIR) system enables the Top Management, the Chief Compliance Officer and the Chief Group Audit and Risk Advisory Executive to capture, track and monitor alleged violations, from initial reports through to resolution.
In 2017 we received 685 reports relating to alleged violations of the Code of Conduct. The vast majority of the reports related to personal integrity cases, such as expense fraud, conflict of interest, abuse of company assets, harassment and discrimination. Out of 685 cases, 292 were unfounded, 102 were still under investigation, and 291 were founded. The amount of unfounded allegations is based on the internal requirement that allegations need to be reported immediately in the system, if and when the management has received information about an allegation.  
On the grounds of unethical behaviour, 131 employment contracts and 4 agreements with business partners were terminated. Further sanctions of unethical behaviour of employees included warning letters, bonus reduction and downgrading of position. Also were appropriate corrective measures taken, such as coaching and trainings. 
Setting forth the standards for business behaviour that apply throughout the Group.

Identifying, analysing and responding appropriately to business risks and opportunities is vital to attaining Roche’s business objectives, protecting the interests of stakeholders and meeting legal requirements.
Managing risk and opportunities
The Risk Management Policy describes our approach for managing material risks – the possibility that an event will occur and adversely affect the achievement of Roche’s objectives.
Risk Management is an integral part of the group’s business practice on all levels of the group. Risk Management includes:
the appropriate response,
tracking and reporting of risks to provide assurance regarding the achievement of objectives.
On Group level this is formalised in the Group Risk Management Process, where Divisional and Group functions and business areas assess risks and develop plans for the most material ones identified. This happens in parallel to the development of the business plans.
consolidated Group Risk Report is then discussed and approved together with the business plan by the Corporate Executive Committee and reviewed by the Board of Directors.
This process is overall supported by Group Risk Advisory, which is responsible for the necessary alignment, co-ordination and development of Group Risk Management. Continuous improvement is applied to the Group Risk Management Process through stakeholder feedback and maturity measurement, and when appropriate external reviews.
In addition, Group Risk Advisory is coordinating / consolidating various risk management activities across the organisation including training and risk awareness activities. Risk management trainings include customised trainings for line management and Risk Managers (including a mandatory online training). There are further trainings including classroom and online trainings that are available for employees. Additionally, upon request Risk Awareness workshops are conducted for functions and regions and Affiliates can receive risk management training to establish their own Risk Management process. These activities also focus on identification and management of risks as well as opportunities.
Also under the lead of Group Risk Advisory, a Risk Forum was kicked off in 2014 to create a cross functional network to explore new ways to raise risk awareness across the organisation. This has evolved into a Risk & Opportunity Alliance (ROAD) which conducts innovation dialogues/workshops to address complex topics which have a cross functional/divisional significance.
Beside Group Risk Advisory many other 2nd lines of controls perform risk management activities and trainings (e.g. Healthcare Compliance, Medical Compliance, Safety, Health & Environment (SHE), Quality, Procurement, Pharma Global Technical Operations, etc.). In addition, many cross-functional risk activities occur within Roche, a few of which are described below as examples.
Financial Risk Management within the Group is governed by policies reviewed by the Board of Directors. Policy implementation and day-to-day Risk Management are carried out by the treasury functions and regular reporting on these risks is performed by the relevant accounting and controlling functions.
Crisis Management, where every subsidiary of the Group have established Emergency Management teams, with corresponding alarm and escalation procedures and authority to act quickly in the event of a crisis. Also, at Group level there is a Emergency Management Organisation and Support (REMOS), supporting Local Emergency Management when needed. These teams comprise operational line management with appropriate authority and they rehearse different crisis scenarios regularly.
risk-based compliance management approach was developed in 2013 for one of the regional organisations to target compliance efforts to areas most at risk. Compliance & Risk Management Office has been established to address specific risks in the procurement area.
Safety, Security, Health and Environmental risks are managed by Group comprehensive bottom-up approach is used to identify and assess all risks which are consolidated in a risk inventory and integrated into the Group Risk Report.
Product Development continues to apply a consistent methodology for identification and management of risks that could impact achievement of development projects.
Digital Media Risk and opportunities continue to be monitored and managed by a cross-functional group.
group wide Business Continuity Programme aims to further strengthen our business continuity management (BCM) to ensure that all sites respond effectively to catastrophic events and deliver a minimum, acceptable level of key products and services. The respective Group policy and guideline is in place, facilitating a consistent and aligned local implementation.
Business sustainability risks and opportunities
We consider Sustainability in a broader context to include three elements: society, the environment and economy. The three elements are interdependent . The Corporate Sustainability Committee is responsible for assessing social, environmental and ethical trends, which is done through the ‘Business Sustainability Risk Assessment’ process. Each year, emerging trends (including associated risks and opportunities) are identified from internal and external sources and are reviewed by selected internal stakeholder groups and the top 5 business sustainability trends are approved by the Corporate Sustainability Committee. These trends represent key areas where we would like to raise internal awareness so that the associated risks and opportunities can be considered as appropriate by our Risk Managers in the respective Risk Assessment of their business unit. Since 2013 these Business Sustainability trends have been reported, first in the Annual Report, now in the complementing part in the internet. This process continues to evolve and is reviewed by the Corporate Sustainability Committee annually.
These top 5 business sustainability trends and associated risks and opportunities are also shared with the Group Risk Managers involved with the Group Risk Management Process where they are then considered and if relevant included within scope of respective risk assessments. Mitigation of these business sustainability risks and opportunities are done at the business unit and/or group level as part of the Group Risk Management Process.
The 5 business sustainability trends identified for 2018 are:
Technological Transformation: The accelerated technological transformation driven by the digital evolution demands innovation and allows to develop more effective and tailored solutions with the consequence to break into existing or even create new markets.
Socioeconomic Shifts: Major shifts within global socioeconomic landscape: Increasing socioeconomic gap between rich and poor in major countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK, US); rising number of people living in urban areas resulting in physical growth of cities; growing share of population reaching middle-class income levels in emerging economies etc.
Changing Climate: Change of climate, which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity, that alters the composition of the global atmosphere, in addition to natural climate variability.
Political Unrest: Inability to reach agreement on key issues within countries because of diverging or extreme values, political or religious views leading to increasing national sentiment among populations and political leaders affecting countries’ national and international political and economic positions.
Shifting power: Shifting power from state to non-state actors and individuals, from global to regional levels, and from developed to emerging market and developing economies including changing landscape of global or regional institutions (e.g. UN, IMF, NATO, etc.), agreements or networks.
Using Technological Transformation and Changing Climate as examples you can see below how these are then developed into specific risks and opportunities at the level of the functions where specific mitigations are applied and managed.
Technological advances: Artificial intelligence, geo-engineering, synthetic biology, computing power, big data offering new opportunities and/or causing human, environmental and economic damage
Disruptive innovation: Changes in business models, value chain as well as the operational processes
Competition: New competitors/ new players (e.g. non-pharma, Google, etc.)
Associated opportunities and risks (threats):
Engaging in new strategic partnerships with companies from different industries and expanding innovation capabilities
Increasing automation, productivity and efficiency (e.g. faster innovative clinical trial design, improved ability to measure safety and efficacy of a drug)
On-demand patient interaction
End-to-end process oversight (e.g. blockchain)
New communication channels to support one brand experience (e.g. social media management)
Inability or failure to compete in the digital health arena
Challenges of integrating companies from different business areas
Inefficiencies due to increased complexity of the technological landscape and interconnectivity
Prohibited promotion to the public due to increased use of multiple social media channels
Failure to position ourselves as an attractive employer
Failure to attract people with right capabilities
Regulation hindering technological developments
Pharmacovigilance risks due to lack of reporting of side effects with potential fines or warning letters
Mitigating actions:
Risk mitigating actions include the redesign and expansion of the previously established Digital Governance Network, now Digital Growth Network, which provides:
Directive on Digital (to guide employees how to use digital media platforms in a responsible way)
Digital Registry to ensure oversight of channels and ongoing monitoring of digital registry metrics
Best practice sharing (e.g. at conferences such as Corporate Risk Minds and internal Knowledge Sharing Webinars such as the quarterly Digital Innovation Webinar with >1400 subscribed users and via an internal G+ Digital Innovation Group)
In addition, the risks associated with technological transformation (e.g. digital evolution) are assessed and managed through the Group Risk Management process for each business unit and consolidated at the Group level.
Additional information on the trend, its potential impact and mitigating actions:
Failure of climate-change mitigation and adaptation: pressure on governments and businesses to enforce or enact effective measures to mitigate climate change, protect populations and help businesses impacted by climate change to adapt
Extreme weather events: major property, infrastructure and/or environmental damage as well as loss of human life caused by extreme weather events
Operational impact: organisational ability to operate as usual and to perform research, to develop, produce and supply drugs and diagnostic tests
Associated opportunities and risks (threats):
changing climate could offer also new business opportunities. We did
a general analysis of corresponding opportunities. We don’t see any significant
opportunities due to climate change for our company short- to mid-term. We
have been committed to mitigating climate change for many years by reducing
energy consumption per employee and substituting non-sustainable with
sustainable energy. This - as a side effect - can contribute to a positive reputation as a sustainable organisation.
Nature interrupting supply of products (e.g. hurricanes)
Challenge of the existing practices (e.g. employee safety)
Challenge of the existing practices
Increasing pressure on the supply chain due to stricter regulations
Mitigating actions:
The approach to climate change is embedded in Roche’s environmental footprint and is an integrated part of the daily business. minimises its environmental footprint by improving environmental efficiency with innovation in its own operations; e.g.:
Building 1, Basel, is a highly energy-efficient building, heated with waste heat and cooled with groundwater, while setting new energy performance standards with its efficient façade design and lighting.
R&location in Penzberg, Germany operates a tri-generation plant, generating heat, cooling and electricity at the same time. This represents an extremely efficient use of energy.
Roche’s site in Pleasanton, fuel-cell co- generates electricity and heat in an environmental-friendly and efficient way.
The risks associated with changing climate (e.g. natural disasters, supply chain interruption) are assessed and managed through the Group Risk Management process for each business unit and consolidated at the Group level.
makes great efforts to substitute non-sustainable energy with sustainable energy that has no/low CO2 emissions with little impact on the climate.

We believe that a highly flexible approach is welcomed by our partners and in our experience delivers the best results.
At each stage of the process we are able to modify and tailor the relationship to the specific needs of each potential partner and depending on what is best for the asset.
The partnering process can be encapsulated in four steps:
Once a new opportunity is identified, we will work alongside our partners with the negotiation team to complete the deal. At the start of negotiations, each project is assigned a Global Alliance Director who will work with the partner through the entire lifetime of the collaboration. We are committed to keeping partners integrally involved with decision making.
Partnering supports Roche’s full value chain, from early-stage Pharma Research and Early Development (pRED) to late-stage Pharma Development, from discovery to commercialisation.
Throughout this process, we also work collaboratively with  Genentech Partnering  and Diagnostics Business Development   to ensure the best outcome for the Group and ultimately for patients.
For early-stage compounds, Roche’s organisations Pharma Research and Early Development (pRED) and Genentech Research and Early Development (gRED) both have full operational autonomy. This is to promote a diversity of research approaches and more innovative outcomes, as well as enabling access to new technologies and promising drug candidates.
For late-stage compounds (typically those that have passed the proof-of-concept stage and are on Phase clinical trials), our partners can benefit from the agility and expertise of a single organisation, Roche, to carry the relationship forward to compound approval and commercialisation.
Deal flexibility and M&competency
Each compound is unique and each partner has different needs; so why should all deals be the same?
We do not have any preconceived notions on the type of deals we should make. Our integrated business development organisation can manage each transaction type and can easily change the structure to suit the needs of each alliance. We are flexible and consider a variety of deal types that range from licensing and acquisitions, to option deals and portfolio agreements, depending on what is best for all parties.
Alliance Management & developing together
At Roche, it is important to us that we and our partners are aligned in our aims and goals.
We are recognised for providing a defined and flexible alliance management structure that ensures the focus remains on the partnership.

Our expanding knowledge and understanding of disease mechanisms combined with our biology and technology expertise began a revolution in how we prevent, diagnose and treat diseases: personalised healthcare. This evolving understanding of disease is making it possible to create targeted medicines for groups of people with the same diseases drivers, making a difference in the lives of many people with serious illnesses.
At Roche, we are taking personalised healthcare toward a future where treatments are targeted to an individual’s needs and unique genetic profile. Our Personalised Healthcare partnering strategy is built around identifying strategic partners with whom we can pursue this vision.
Our areas of focus include forming collaborations to:
Develop robust clinico-genomic and imaging datasets
Draw unique insights from the data that will enhance discovery, development and targeting of medicines through machine learning and other advanced analytic techniques
Enhance clinical trial execution and the treatment of patients through the development of digital and mobile technologies

Investigator initiated studies 
Over the past few years we have continuously improved the organisational and technological framework for cooperation between our Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics Divisions. Although they have different Research & Development (R&D) processes, the two divisions can share research facilities, technologies and discoveries when working together on internal projects.
This is a unique advantage that sets apart from other companies. Diagnostic tools are finding increasing use in pharmaceutical research. Most importantly, close cooperation is the basis for the successful implementation of our personalised healthcare strategy.
Three Pharma R&units
To ensure a strong flow of suitable candidate molecules into its development pipeline, has built a unique innovation network of independent Pharma research and development centers.
Pharma Research and Early Development (pRED), Genentech Research and Early Development (gRED) as well as Chugai in Japan operate independently within the group. Together with more than 150 partner organisations worldwide this network promotes a diversity of research approaches, as well as enabling access to new technologies and promising drug candidates.
Our global enable our innovation centers to be thriving and we manage this mainly through visibility and metrics. We have set up common standards, and common understandings of the risks and opportunities in their standards.
class-leading system that allows exchange of knowledge around the globe within hours of the experiment being finished leads to prediction and ultimately to better medicines. The distinguishing factor is how we manage this global group and how we allow all partners to access science and innovation in a way that suits them best.
Four Diagnostics R&units
Within our Diagnostics Division, Professional Diagnostics, Diagnostics, Tissue Diagnostics, and Diabetes Care, we are developing a number of instruments and solutions to improve medical outcomes and make testing more efficient. We strive to further strengthen our position as the world’s leading supplier of in vitro diagnostics (IVDs). IVDs play a key role in helping doctors to detect and diagnose diseases, select appropriate treatments and monitor patient response to care. These tests are either performed in a laboratory or at the point of care on blood, tissue or other patient samples.
By offering tests that enable patients and physicians to obtain medically relevant information, we are able to improve outcomes for patients.
pRED, gRED, Diagnostics and Chugai operate independently within our group, forming the hubs of an innovation network that includes alliances with more than 150 outside partners, such as universities, research institutes and biotech companies. Together with our partners we turn the multiplicity of ideas into medical innovation; about one third of the current projects in Roche’s pipeline have come from these alliances.

Biomarkers for disease areas
Diagnostics evaluates new biomarker opportunities by continuously monitoring universities, start-ups, medical and research institutes, mid sized and large companies.
The goal is to identify biomarkers that address significant unmet medical needs to enable novel and important physician decision making along the entire continuum of a patient’s journey.
Roche’s tests provide crucial knowledge about the different diseases during the whole spectrum of care (screening - diagnosis - prognosis - prediction - monitoring), enabling physicians and caretakers to intervene early and to actively manage patients’ health conditions.
We are interested in clinically validated biomarkers in a variety of indications including:
Infectious diseases
Central nervous system diseases, including brain traumatism
Respiratory diseases
Coagulation and haematology
Diabetes and other metabolic diseases
The biomarker-driven drug development across the industry is driving the group's personalised healthcare strategy across many therapeutic areas for different intended uses.
If you have an idea, we would like to hear from you.

Clinical trials are essential to determine whether new drugs or diagnostics are safe and effective when used to diagnose or treat people. Interested in learning about or participating in one of our clinical trials?
Visit our ForPatients platform
What is a clinical trial and how does it work?
Every new treatment is usually tested in three phases of clinical trials before regulatory agencies consider it safe and effective.
Ever wondered how patient outcomes are measured in clinical trials?
Today, approaches that measure cancer treatment are more comprehensive – they look to extend patients’ lives and maintain quality of life.
Illuminating ideas: Innovative clinical trial design
As we head further into the era of precision healthcare, new ways to evolve the drug development process are being explored. Here, we look at some of the latest approaches.
Following global standards
All clinical studies, no matter where they are conducted, are managed in compliance with international guidelines.
Protecting Patient Safety
Patient safety is a top priority. Find out how we optimise patient safety throughout the lifecycle of a medicine.
Developed in partnership with patients, ForPatients aims to support patients on their journey.

Access to investigational medicines outside of a clinical trial
Some patients with serious or immediately life-threatening diseases may not be eligible for any clinical trials and may not have other options. Under specific circumstances and in compliance with applicable laws, we may provide patients with pre-approval access (PAA) to unapproved or investigational medicines outside the clinical trials process, before they are approved by regulatory authorities.

Research process
believes that finding innovative solutions for serious, currently unsolved medical problems is what a healthcare company is all about. Our people strive to create clinically differentiated drugs and diagnostic tests to enable tangible improvements in the health, quality of life and survival of patients.
Today sophisticated technologies and insights are available to better understand the root causes of diseases, to develop and adjust treatment to the patients. However discovering and developing novel medicines and diagnostic tests is still a very complex and time consuming undertaking.
Over the past few years we have continuously improved the organisational and technological framework for cooperation between our Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics Divisions.
Although they have different & processes, the two divisions can share research facilities, technologies and discoveries when working together on internal projects. This is a unique advantage that sets apart from other companies. Diagnostic tools are finding increasing use in pharmaceutical research. Most importantly, close cooperation is the basis for the successful implementation of our personalised healthcare strategy.

We are pursuing several strategic focus areas for neuroscience partnering. These are: neurodegeneration, neuroimmunology, psychiatry, and neurodevelopmental disorders.
We are particularly interested in programmes, including early-stage, that focus on priority targets and disease modifying pathways, provided that preclinical proof of concept is available and the compound has suitable physico-chemical characteristics.
We are open to treatments that are either disease-modifying or have a superior impact on those symptoms that are sub-optimally controlled with existing treatments.
In neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimers’s disease , Parkinson’s disease (PD), and Huntington’s disease (HD), we focus on the correction of those pathologies that are associated with misfolded proteins. We also look into therapies that target the associated neuroinflammation. In multiple sclerosis (MS), we are very interested in therapies offering the prospect of remyelination and ameliorating neuroinflammation in the Better modulation of fatigue and enhancement of cognition are also of interest.
Schizophrenia is a condition with established therapeutics for stage one disease but very little is available for the negative symptoms in chronic disease which include apathy, blunted emotion and depression. There have been recent advances in the understanding of disease pathology and we are interested in oral or biologic compounds that have agents which address unmet medical need, positive residual symptoms and approaches in Personalised Healthcare (PHC) enabling better patient stratification. Genetic evidence and circuit relevance of target are important information and relevance should be demonstrated by target modulation and circuit engagement in translational models.
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) constitutes a spectrum of heterogeneous types including autism, Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) – for which no current therapies exist. Our focus is currently on the heterogenous phenotype and genetic forms of autism.
We continue to seize opportunities as they arise in areas such as schizophrenia positive symptoms, schizophrenia maintenance, bipolar disorder, and depression, and typically require evidence of a clinical signal before we further evaluate drug candidates in these indications.
Our strategy in ophthalmology focuses on serious diseases affecting the back of the eye which result in blindness. They include: age-related macular degeneration (AMD), geographic atrophy (GA), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and diabetic macular edema (DME)
Dry and related have no currently approved therapies. The scientists at are committed to the development of therapies for these retinal diseases and are seeking drug candidates with neuro-protective and retinal epithelial-preserving properties. In addition, we are also actively seeking novel therapies for the wet form AMD, diabetic macular edema, and other related diabetic retinal complications that would complement our Lucentis (ranibizumab) franchise.
Other diseases where we seize opportunities as they arise include glaucoma, severe dry eye and rare inherited retinal dystrophies (e.g. retinitis pigmentosa). In glaucoma, we are particularly interested in therapies that have demonstrated the ability to protect retinal neurons, and compounds that lower intraocular pressure to a greater extent than standard therapies.
Rare diseases
Apart from the neuro-rare and ophthalmology rare diseases mentioned above, we are keen to partner in therapeutics for monogenic diseases affecting various other organ such as blood, lung, heart and liver. The focus is on late pre-clinical or clinical stage assets, either large or small molecules.
If you have a promising drug candidate in these areas, why not get in touch with us?

In Immunology and Inflammation, our core focus is on chronic, immunologically-mediated and inflammatory-driven diseases.
We focus on innovative scientific mechanisms that have the potential to translate to products that are first-in-class or best-in-class and/or best-in-disease. Our therapeutic areas of focus include rheumatologic, respiratory, and gastrointestinal diseases. Molecules that can strategically complement our existing strong franchises in these areas are given priority. We prioritise programmes that have strong target biology and human translational evidence in three areas of biology: Innate Immunity, Adaptive Immunity and Tissue Inflammation / Fibrosis.
In Infectious Diseases, our focus is on Hepatitis (HBV), influenza and multidrug resistant Gram-negative antibacterials. For hepatitis B, we are looking for any products or therapeutic strategies to achieve functional and complete cure. While these indications are key to Roche, we are also seeking innovative, best-in-class treatments for chronic or non-chronic viral infections with high unmet need such as and other respiratory infections. We prioritise products with robust clinical proof of concept and/or clinical differentiation.
Lastly, our Specialty Care focus covers chronic diseases with an infectious, immunologic or inflammatory-mediated pathophysiology which are treated by specialist healthcare professionals and targeted by a focused sales force, and which complement our existing franchises.
