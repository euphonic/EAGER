Talk confidentially and off-the-record with a neutral Ombudsperson.
How can the Ombuds help you?
What do you do if you have a concern in the workplace? Or if you see something you believe may violate Eaton’s values or policies? An ombudsperson is a neutral, independent source you can talk to confidentially and off-the-record about work-related concerns or questions. They can help you address and resolve your concerns. 
The Ombuds Office is a safe and reliable place to have confidential and off-the-record discussions about workplace problems or concerns.
Discussions are off-the-record
Matters discussed with the Ombuds are off-the-record, which means they do not constitute formal notice to Eaton. The Ombuds will identify and discuss with you other channels at that exist for notice.
What to expect when you contact the Ombuds
Your question or concern will be taken seriously and responded to promptly, discreetly and professionally.
Think of the Ombuds as a coach who listens to you — and then helps determine the nature and extent of your concern, the pros and cons of different options to address it and an approach for taking it forward.
You determine the action to be taken. The Ombuds will not take action or tell anyone about your conversations, not even Eaton, unless you explicitly give permission to do so. 
The only exception is a situation of imminent risk of serious harm.
Ombuds supplements, but does not replace, formal conflict resolution channels such as ethics and compliance, human resources, management, the employee assistance program (EAP), or the health, safety and quality departments.

The path to Intelligent Power
We make the “things” that make the Internet of Things work. Our electrical, aerospace, hydraulic and vehicle products and services live at the origin of data.
We bring Intelligent Power to life through three key pillars: 
Assets – Sensors in the products that collect data
We equip our products with sensors and sensing capabilities to dissect the fundamental makeup of power, whether it’s electrical power (current, voltage, frequency and power factor), fluid power (pressure, flow rates, displacement and contamination) or mechanical power (force, speed, pressure and displacement). Because we know how our products are best operated and maintained and have a depth of expertise in your applications, we make greater advancements in productivity and cost efficiency. 
Data science — Creating actionable information and knowledge
Raw, unprocessed data has limited value. It’s the transformation of that data into actionable decision points that helps our customers reduce their cost of ownership, drive efficiency and maximize uptime. We use virtual digital models, or “digital twins,” to mimic physical assets in the real world. This allows us to rapidly design, build and test solutions virtually before committing to large capital deployments. We then extract knowledge from the virtual digital models by asking the right questions (What happened? Why? How can we control it?) to help inform new product development. 
Connectivity – Industry-standard protocols to aggregate and disseminate data
We rely on common protocols and infrastructures to send and receive data. While there are many processes within the markets we serve, we remain cloud and services agnostic. We strive to develop a communications platform approach that is open, scalable and secure — transforming the way systems, things, people and processes interact with one another. We also work with your partners to increase scalability and ease compliance.  
The information collected and analyzed by our products helps you optimize processes across the board to increase their overall value throughout an extended product lifecycle. With our Intelligent Power solutions, you and your customers can depend on a lower total cost of ownership and a healthier bottom line.
Our digital expertise and Intelligent Power solutions let us help you:
Generate the raw data you need to develop insights
Better understand your power use to create better business models
Develop and deploy enhanced data-driven solutions
By collecting and transforming data into clear insights, you’ll have the information needed to continually make better decisions faster. See a real-world example: explore how Eaton’s IoT-enabled Energy Management Circuit Breaker changes the way homes across the manage power.
Flexible programs and technologies that wrap around your needs.
Powering the information blueprint
Because the Iospace moves fast, we are platform agnostic. We report on data by way of core programs that sit on top of today’s existing technologies, allowing us to wrap our solutions around your needs with greater ease. 
Visualization tools that use generated data to provide easy-to-use, consistent experiences across mobile devices, digital control screens and web-based apps. 
Services that allow us to consistently pull information from assets, store and analyze it and share it with customers. 
Embedded systems
Hardware and software packages that help us take advantage of the latest in computing power as it becomes available. 
Cybersecurity
Our breadth drives intelligence
When it comes to Ioinnovation, our scale sets us apart from other solution providers who lack the same breadth of knowledge.
Sharing information throughout our company is a critical part of how we leverage the idea of Intelligent Power. We efficiently capitalize on our scale by sharing the learnings from our core disciplines — electrical, hydraulics, aerospace and vehicle — through the Business System: cross-business processes that allow us to share best practices and synergies. While some players may have electrical expertise, for instance, they don’t have the luxury of data from a vehicle or hydraulics business. 
Our shared knowledge, combined with our global reach and resources, helps us realize greater, more immediate innovation for our customers. 
Sharing information across is at the core of Intelligent Power.
Our Iocapabilities in action
See how shared learnings across our disciplines allows for some of the most efficient and versatile Ioinnovations in market today.

Customized support for aging infrastructure
The electrical grid has been in place for decades and, by and large, has been a dependable electricity distribution network. But with aging equipment, lack of maintenance and infrastructure investment, the proliferation of newer energy-hungry devices and increasing costs, it's showing signs of wear and an inability to keep up with demand.
With grid dependability waning, more municipalities, advanced research centers, secure government campuses, large-scale utilities and urban and rural residential communities are turning to microgrids: stand-alone electrical systems that consist of multiple generation sources and defined loads that can operate independently from the primary utility grid.
Microgrids use electricity with greater efficiency. At the heart of a microgrid lay a series of interconnected Iodevices  that rely on embedded software and sensors to collect and exchange data. These devices are installed at key areas, like inverters, battery storage units and power generators, to measure and record multiple power usage and other data points in fractions of a second. technologies link these connected devices via a suite of platform-agnostic tools.
How a microgrid works
microgrid is a group of power generation assets that can either work with a utility provider or work independently to feed critical loads. Connected to a utility and traditional fossil fuel generators, as well as renewable sources such as wind and solar, microgrids work to collect, store and optimize energy to provide reliable, efficient electricity solutions in the event of power loss.
Here's a typical microgrid scenario that demonstrates how reduces dependency on a utility by using data to determine the source of power:
2pm – 6pm Solar energy and demand increase. Energy storage supplements demand as required. Any excess solar may be used to charge the batteries to meet evening demand.
6pm – 10pm software optimizes how and when to use the available distributed energy resources. While the Utility provides power via fossil fuel generators, additional power is pulled from wind, remaining daylight and energy storage to reduce Utility dependency.
10pm – 2am Wind energy can reduce Utility contribution. With it, batteries are charged during periods of lesser demand should the wind pick up overnight.
2am-6am Wind may or may not be active and solar is almost non-existent. Energy storage supports the additional load on the generators during this time..
6am – 10am Solar energy, as well as demand, start to pick up. Fossil fuel generator power and solar power reduce the demand and energy storage is used less during this period. Any excess solar can be used to charge storage batteries.
10am – 2pm Solar energy and demand increase. Energy storage supplements demand as required. Any excess solar may be used to charge the batteries to meet evening demand.
2pm – 6pm Solar energy and demand increase. Energy storage supplements demand as required. Any excess solar may be used to charge the batteries to meet evening demand.
6pm – 10pm software optimizes how and when to use the available distributed energy resources. While the Utility provides power via fossil fuel generators, additional power is pulled from wind, remaining daylight and energy storage to reduce Utility dependency.
Different microgrids for different goals
microgrid is as unique as the business, community or government institution that deploys one. The solution is never "one-size-fits-all"; by understanding an organization's needs and wants, microgrid developers can identify the applications and assets needed to custom engineer an appropriate solution.
Organizations typically fall within the spectrum of three goals: reliability, affordability and sustainability. Of course, every customer would like to build a microgrid that "does it all." However, while benefits sometimes overlap, building a solution that entirely satisfies all three objectives could be cost prohibitive.
The need for consistent, always-on power is a huge concern for many companies and residential communities. After Superstorm Sandy in 2012, and most recently Hurricanes Irma and Maria, many states, such as New York, Connecticut and Massachusetts, awarded grants and passed disaster-response legislation to reduce or eliminate power loss. Frequency regulation is also a factor. As more coal and oil plants decommission and their inverters come offline, many states experience frequency and voltage control fluctuations.
Additionally, remote and island communities and developing African nations are exploring microgrids for resilient energy to lessen dependency on fossil fuels, especially oil and diesel.
Many governments, large corporations and institutions look to microgrids for financial benefits. As natural gas prices continue to drop, companies want to capture the gas-generator heat they already produce via combined heat and power: the on-site capture of heat that would otherwise be wasted to produce steam or hot water used for space heating, cooling and other industrial processes.
In some cases, larger organizations generate the same output as a utility and even create power surpluses they can sell to their utility provider. This return-on-investment approach is especially attractive to larger organizations with multiple generators.
Reduced dependency on fossil fuels is a concern of many, thus the desire to store energy from renewables such as wind and solar. However, these resources are intermittent; the sun isn't always shining or the wind blowing. West coast states in the are exploring battery storage solutions in order get the most from renewables while helping to better the environment.

When cost is a factor, supports a staged build out. For instance, if an organization wants to add a generator one year, a battery in year two and a wind turbine in the third year, components can be added without a major rewrite of code logic. That's because is 75% pre-engineered, with the remaining code and application configuration custom built to customer-specific environments and key performance indicators. This includes customized solutions and full simulation testing. And because all controllers are gateway components, cyber security is inherent thanks to features already built in.
