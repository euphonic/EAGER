​Employment / Internship Contract Scam
Over time, and most recently in 2019, became aware of false job/internship communications from entities posing as our company, brands and employees. The scam asked for personal and/or financial information from job seekers and internship applicants. These electronic communications – whether by email or text message -- were not from or anyone authorized to communicate on its behalf. Nor are any of the associated documents actual or legitimate documents. Unfortunately, the tactics that scammers use constantly changes, and the scammers are difficult to identify and shut down. We urge all candidates to be aware and cautious when applying for jobs and internships.
The online website tools used in our job application process will not require you to provide your financial information; nor will it ask you to sign a "contract" if you have not already applied through the website and spoken in person with an authorized representative. Any Industrial-authorized representative will gladly give you a return phone number or email address so that you can confirm their authenticity if you have any questions about whether an electronic communication you have received is legitimate.

New Holland Agriculture partners with the Indian Agricultural Research Institute to pioneer Straw Management and fight stubble burning
​New Holland Agriculture, a brand of (NYSE: /MI: CNHI), has initiated a three-year pioneer project, in partnership with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) and the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), which launched the initiative with the aim of helping farmers towards an eco-friendly uses of crop residue.
India generates some 620 million tons of crop residue annually, which has significant nutrient potential. The disposal of crop residue, generated in large quantities, has become a hazard as a result of on-farm burning which reduces land productivity due to its negative effects. Crop-residue burning also results in haze, leading to the outbreak of breathing ailments, particularly in northern India. The on-farm burning of crop residues has intensified in recent years as low cost and easily adaptable technologies for its handling and management are unavailable, and the window between harvesting one crop and sowing the next is extremely short. 
​In order to prevent the resultant pollution, this three-year project is focused on researching and developing a sustainable and economically-viable crop residue management strategy in the form of a sustainable business model. Dr. Indra Mani, Head of the Division of Agricultural Engineering ICAR-will lead the project. In addition to funding the entire project, New Holland Agriculture will offer its straw management equipment for research and also provide the technical input to develop a holistic straw management solution, offering technologies for crop residue management.
“We at are committed in our efforts to find sustainable solutions for environmental conservation and protecting the future of agriculture in India,” said Raunak Varma, Country Manager for in India. “The burning of crop residue pollutes the environment causes and kills beneficial soil microorganisms. In our role as an agricultural equipment manufacturer with a complete range of solutions, including tractors, balers, rakes and mulchers for Straw Management, it is our responsibility to take part in finding a long-term crop residue burning solution. As such, we are delighted to collaborate with ICAR-in this pioneering collaborative project with the common goal of protecting the environment and future of agriculture in India.”
