Before founding ISTN, Dr. Yang was Technical Director of Armstrong Insulation Product Research, where he led an R&team of 25 people specializing in flexible foam insulation research. While at Armstrong, Dr. Yang won an Advanced Program (ATP) grant from in 1992 to develop nanopore thermal insulation using silica sol-gel chemistry, one of the first government grants ever awarded for the commercialization of a nanotechnology-enabled product. Dr. Yang is an Adjunct Professor in Chemical Engineering at the University of Maryland's James Clark School of Engineering and a Guest Scientist at the National Institute of Standards and (NIST). He also serves on the Department of Energy's Center of Excellence for the Synthesis and Processing of Advanced Materials. Dr. Yang has a Ph.in Physical Chemistry from Brown University, where he was awarded the Potter Prize in Chemistry for having the most outstanding thesis in his Ph.class.
Dr. Cohen is a Professor of Chemical Engineering at Cornell University and served as Director of the School of Chemical Engineering from 1990 to 1993. His current research interests include structures and properties of elastomers, light scattering of polymers and suspensions, and soil remediation using amphiphilic polyurethane (APU) nano-polymer particles to remove hydrophobic pollutants. He was a recipient of the DuPont Young Faculty Award in 1978. He has also served as a Visting Scientist at IBM's Almaden Research Center and recipient of The Sandy and Russell Rosen Lectureship in Chemical Engineering (Technion Haifa, Israel). Dr. Cohen has authored and co-authored over 80 publications. Before arriving at Cornell, Dr. Cohen worked a Katzir-Katchalsky Fellow at the Weizmann Institute in Israel, a Research Associate at the California Institute of Technology, and a Postdoctoral Fellow at Brown University. He received his Ph.from Princeton University.
Dr. Exarhos is a Laboratory Fellow and directs the Materials Chemistry Research Group at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL). He also is the Program Coordinator for the suite of basic materials research projects at the laboratory and coordinates multidisciplinary programs on tailored nanostructures and smart materials supported through two Centers for Materials Synthesis and Processing. Dr. Exarhos is a member of the Board of Directors of the American Vacuum Society and has chaired the National Meeting and National Symposium. He has also chaired the International Conference on Metallurgical Coatings and Thin Films and Annual Symposium on Optical Materials for High Power Lasers. He is also an Adjunct Professor of Physics at Washington State University, a Fellow of the American Ceramic Society, and a member of the editorial board for a variety of publications. During his career, Dr. Exarhos has authored over 170 technical papers and books as well as six patents. He has received IR&100 and Federal Laboratory Consortium awards relating to thin film materials and advanced materials processing. Prior to assuming his current position, he was on the faculty of the Chemistry Department at Harvard University, where he directed research involving spectroscopic characterization of redox processes at oxide surfaces, ion transport in oxides, and development of radar absorbing coatings. He received his Ph.in Physical Chemistry from Brown University.
State Key Laboratory of Polymer Physics and Chemistry
Dr. Han is a Professor and Chairman of the State Key Laboratory of Polymer Physics and Chemistry in Beijing, China. He is one of the worldâ€™s leading scientists in the field of polymer physics. His current research interests include application of various scattering techniques (light, small angle neutron, small angle x-ray) in polymer research, domain structures and order-disorder transition of block copolymers, morphology and property control of polymer blends and block copolymers, phase separation and polymer processing. Previously, he was a Fellow in the Polymers Division of He has won numerous awards for his work in polymer physics, including Gold, Silver and Bronze Medals from the a line wedding dresses Department of Commerce, the American Physical Societyâ€™s Dillon Medal, NISTâ€™s Samuel Wesley Stratton Award for Best Research, and the American Physical Societyâ€™s High Polymer Physics Prize. He received his Ph.in Physical Chemistry from the University of Wisconsin, Madison.
