We may collect personal information directly from you (e.g., when you register for an account with us), and we may collect other personal information from you automatically, including data collected using cookies and other device identifying technologies.
We may be required by law to collect certain personal information about you, or as a consequence of any contractual relationship we have with you. Failure to provide this information may prevent or delay the fulfillment of these obligations. We will inform you at the time your information is collected if certain data is compulsory and the consequences of the failure to provide such data.

We may automatically collect certain information from you when use the Services or visit websites. This information allows us to recognize you and personalize your experience if you return to the Services, and to improve the Services and the services we provide.

You may be able to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you may be able to turn off all cookies. You do this through your browser settings.

We use these technical methods to analyze traffic patterns on the Services, such as the frequency with which our visitors visit various parts of websites. These technical methods may involve the transmission of information either directly to us or to another party authorized by us to collect information on our behalf. We may also use these technical methods in emails (which we may send from time to time to individuals on our mailing lists) to determine whether such visitors have opened those emails or clicked on links in those emails.
The categories of information that we may automatically collect from you are:
