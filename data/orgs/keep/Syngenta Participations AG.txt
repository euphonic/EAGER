                Every day, there are 200,000 more mouths to feed. By 2050, that’s about 2 billion more people who will need food
Hunger, health, a growing population, the need to farm sustainably – these are some of the issues facing our planet.
In the next 50 years the world must produce more food than in the last 10,000. But we’re currently using resources 50% faster than the planet can sustain.
How do we meet the challenge while protecting nature, helping people in rural communities live better lives, and satisfying consumers who demand greater variety, quality and quantity of food?
People agree that producing enough food for a growing population is one of the next decade’s biggest challenges. Yet we don’t agree on the solutions.  
Many are open to technology in principles but want to minimize the use of pesticides, fertilizers and genetically modified seeds.  Many believe more water and land should be used, but there’s limited understanding of the consequences of doing so.
Many crops rely on the pollination provided by bees and other insects. But farm landscapes often lack the diversity and abundance of flowers that pollinators need.

Regardless of size, the challenge for farmers is to grow healthier, more productive plants. We work with growers to get more out of their crops while keeping workers safe and farms profitable.
Farming must be financially rewarding or farmers will leave the land. We help to open up markets and make sure farmers get a fair price and a reasonable profit.
Renukamma Umapathi is a smallholder in southern India. At one time she was barely making a living. With training, she now earns enough to send her children to school and has been able to double the size of the family’s farm. 
Farmers are challenged to increase productivity without using more land or water. At the same time, they need to enhance biodiversity and reduce soil degradation. Through our commitments of The Good Growth Plan, we help enable growers to do all of these things when farming intensively.
Rice is a major source of nutrition, income and employment throughout Asia. We train growers to protect their crop throughout its entire life cycle, resulting in healthier plants and yield increases of up to 30%.
In northern Thailand, Khaona Sansadao is one of the small-scale rice growers using our GroMore protocol. Growers learn how to manage resources efficiently and safely. After one year Khaona achieved his largest yield yet, increasing his earnings and enabling him to provide more for his family.
Renivar Mandelo says The Good Growth Plan has “helped to open up my mind”. His coffee farm is twice as productive as the average in his home country of Brazil, making it important to the community.
Our NUCOFFEE® model in Brazil supports growers in sustainable production, ensuring traceability and increasing growers’ revenues by up to 50%. 
Our Conservando Mi Tierrita program in Colombia reduces soil erosion through tilling techniques and water use. It has increased productivity by 25-30% while reducing soil loss by 67%. 
Miguel Gil is one of the potato farmers in the Cundinamarca region to benefit. “I’ve moved from producing 400 bags per hectare to 600,” he says. ” I’m saving money and producing more thanks to Syngenta, their products and advice.”

In Italy, farmers have increased the production of biogas, which is used to generate electrical power or heat, by planting HYVIDO® hybrid barley instead of corn, wheat or triticale.
HYVIDO® offers several advantages over other crops; for example, it is more able to resist diseases, is more resilient to severe weather conditions and produces more organic material from each hectare. Also, farmers are able to plant two crops a year instead of one because HYVIDO® has a shorter production time than alternative crops.
In 2015, after just two years, HYVIDO® accounted for 30,000 hectares in Italy.

As we work with farmers in Mexico to increase productivity in a sustainable way, we ensure they are also trained in safe use of crop protection products.
We have joined with government and partners from industry in the MasAgro program – The Sustainable Modernization of Traditional Agriculture, overseen by the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center or The aim is to target smallholders who lack access to agricultural technologies and markets to help them raise productivity of corn and wheat, increasing incomes.
To ensure as many people as possible are trained, experts educate technicians who then train farmers. In 2015, the program reached 2,600 smallholders.

Developing higher-yielding crop varieties is essential to producing more from less. One answer lies in agriculture’s next science revolution – analytics.
The R&soybean breeding team used advanced mathematics and new tools to improve the process of growing a wider variety of healthy crops. The tools dramatically improved project lead training, decision-making and planning.
The soybean breeding program won the 2015 Franz Edelman Award, the most prestigious recognition of applying advanced analytics to benefit business and humanitarian outcomes.
The power of analytics is truly transformational in agriculture, and we are now customizing these tools for use on corn, sunflowers, rice and even watermelons.

 enables us to measure our progress against the commitments we’ve made to boosting resource efficiency, rejuvenating ecosystems and strengthening rural communities. We’re also committed to developing our people, reducing our environmental footprint, enhancing our social engagement, raising supply chain sustainability and doing business responsibly. 
changing climate affects farmers’ ability to produce better and more abundant food for a growing population. We encourage growers to adopt climate-smart practices that help them to optimize inputs, reduce soil-based carbon emissions and build crop resilience. 
Climate Change also impacts our own operations, through altered weather patterns and water availability. We monitor our performance in energy efficiency and carbon emissions to identify opportunities to reduce our impacts.
More and more, climate change is impacting our experience in the field.
We encourage growers to adopt conservation agriculture practices, which help them optimize water use, increase soil water holding capacity, reduce water runoff and build crop resilience to changing weather patterns. 
The United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) address forms of global inequality, insecurity and injustice through specific targets to be achieved by 2030.
They help to mobilize the action and innovation needed to make a better and more sustainable world.
The SDGs underscore the relevance and significance of our Good Growth Plan: its six commitments directly contribute to SDG2 - Zero hunger - and significantly support seven of the other goals.
We have to ensure we use resources with ever greater efficiency. This involves continually reviewing and adjusting our operations and building on established relationships with suppliers.
For many years, we have worked to build respect for people and human dignity into everything we do – from the way we interact with our colleagues and suppliers to the contribution our products, services and training make in improving food security, access to water, farmers’ livelihoods and rural development.
We engage with universities, NGOs, business, governments and communities to help mobilize action for a sustainable future.

It’s about working in a more strategic, joined-up way: listening to local communities and understanding their concerns, then working together on long-term solutions where everyone has a sense of ownership. 
“We didn’t want to give the impression that will bring out the checkbook and all problems would be solved,” says Andrew Chanda, our local Health Safety Environment Security Manager. “It’s important that this is a joint effort between Syngenta, the school and the community.”
He’s talking about the new block of classrooms at Chainda Primary School, attended by children of employees at our Seeds site. The school had been struggling to teach over 1,000 pupils in just 12 classrooms. Parents were buying bricks for an extension block – so we matched their donations and the community built the block. “And everyone takes ownership,” says Andrew.
The school is 25km from our farm, and most children had to walk there. So we bought a community bus to transport them - school attendance is up, and the bus is much safer that taking a ride in the back of a truck.
believes it is important to engage local communities and work with them. We respond to concerns, contribute to local needs and look to partner with them. This involves listening, sharing value, protecting the environment, promoting health and improving quality of life.
The community also tapped into our expertise to address the challenge of waste disposal. Due to lack of infrastructure and local waste companies, together with a surfeit of plastic bags, waste was often dealt with by burning – creating pollution and a risk of crop fires in the dry season.
We formed a partnership with a South African recycling company that now collects the plastic waste and is also helping to educate the community on better ways to dispose of other waste.
Community-driven projects like these reflect a long-term view of community engagement, where we join with our neighbors in achieving positive and lasting social impacts while also reducing risk to farm operations. “We’re very fortunate to be able to do this,” says Bryan Pinkney, Head of Farming Operations. “This is something really appreciate about working for – that we care.”

continues global collaborations to combat malaria and help protect African farmers’ health and livelihoods
Nearly half of the world’s population is at risk of malaria, a major public health threat spread through the bites of female 
mosquitoes. It’s responsible for the deaths of around 445’000 people globally in 2016, including many growers.
Increased prevention and control measures have led to a significant reduction in malaria mortality rates globally since 2010. These gains have been primarily achieved through the use of insecticide treated bed-nets and indoor residual sprays containing pyrethroid insecticides. However, extensive use of these interventions has led to mosquitoes becoming resistant.
To overcome this challenge embarked on a collaboration with the 
 (IVCC), to develop ACTELLIC® 300CS, a novel tool to combat resistance and protect more people. 
The solution is a longer-lasting product that is highly effective against resistant mosquitoes. ACTELLIC® 300is applied to the interior walls of houses and when a mosquito lands on the wall it picks up a dose of insecticide and dies. single application offers mosquito control for at least 9 months instead of the 2-3 months offered by conventional products. 
It has now been used in 32 countries across sub-Saharan Africa and it is estimated that the solution protected around 34 million people from malaria in 2017.  Its use has seen malaria transmission reduced by almost 40% in Eastern Zimbabwe and up to 60% in Northern Ghana. In Central-West Senegal, the risk of malaria transmission was 14 times lower following applications of ACTELLIC® 300CS.
We have extended our collaboration with 
, and additional partners such as UNITAID, to ensure that this technology is accessible to as many of the vulnerable communities as possible. Developing this solution not only contributes to the Sustainable Development Goals (3), it helps us meet our commitment of contributing to the health and quality of life of the communities in which we work.
 is a not-for-profit public-private partnership, established as a charity in 2005, whose mission is to improve health by enabling partnerships for the development and delivery of new insect control products; is funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), USAID, and the Swiss Development Corporation.
Indoor spraying works by coating a wall with an insecticide from floor to ceiling. When a mosquito lands on the wall, it picks up a dose of insecticide and dies. Traditional formulations are typically effective for 2-3 months when applies as a spray, which require multiple applications every year, which can be costly. Actellic® 300helps families at risk control mosquitos inside their homes just once a year.

In China, we have partnered with the Ministry of Agriculture in a program that has been training farmers on safe and effective use of crop protection since 2000. In 2012 alone, together with local partners, we facilitated over 8,500 farmer meetings that delivered training on the safe use of pesticides and better farming practices to almost 260,000 farmers.
We cover how to properly protect oneself when spraying pesticide. The techniques used for handling and spraying pesticides must all conform to safety procedures. We are also telling farmers about the different types of diseases and pests, the conditions they thrive in, and their life cycles and habits. This way we will be able to implement scientific methods of prevention and control.

Encouraging progressive smallholders to share expertise with others makes a tangible difference by increasing yields and incomes.
In East Java, Indonesia, successful rice growers are educating other farmers in good agricultural practices and the implementation of our GROMORE™ solution. Rice growers who raise yields to 10 tonnes per hectare are invited to join the Rice Ten Tonne Club. Supported by agronomists and government farming counselors, these lead farmers then pass on their knowledge to groups of smallholders.
So far, more than 15,000 smallholders are benefiting from modern methods of growing rice.

Through our knowledge of plant genetics, we’ve changed barley from a self-pollinating variety to one in which pollen flows from male to female plants. This means we can create hybrids with high yields and robust vigor. With the use of agronomic protocols, seed production can be maximized.
Frank Edelbauer, who plants HYVIDO® hybrid barley on his farm in Germany, says it “has made a good impression on us” by delivering high grain weights and good yields.

In 2015, the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Summit in New York adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). These are a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity. They define the UN’s development agenda up to 2030.
We welcome and support the SDGs. We believe they will help to mobilize the action and innovation necessary to make a better and more sustainable world. This will need new ways of thinking and working, fresh approaches that create new opportunities – and a massive step up in collaboration among governments, NGOs, businesses, financial and donor institutions, schools and universities. The shared goal should be to make educated decisions for a sustainable future where economic growth goes hand in hand with a healthy environment and respect for human rights.
The SDGs underscore the relevance and significance of our Good Growth Plan. Its six commitments directly contribute to SDG2 - Zero hunger - and significantly support seven of the other goals:  
            End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture
Good health and well-being
Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages
Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all
The Good Growth Plan, Look after every worker
Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns
The Good Growth Plan, Make crops more efficient 
Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
The Good Growth Plan, Rescue more farmland
Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss

How agriculture can support adaptation to climate change through better management of soil
Climate change is disrupting agriculture in every corner of the world, from droughts or floods that damage crops, to rising seas that threaten rural communities. Sustainable intensive agriculture has an important role to play in reducing the effects of rising temperatures. By improving soil fertility, enhancing biodiversity, and creating connected landscapes we can help growers adapt to changing climate conditions.
Responsible management of soil makes agriculture more resilient to the causes and effects of climate change. Soil is a major storage area for carbon in our ecosystem. But when soil is degraded or disturbed, carbon is released back into the atmosphere and becomes a greenhouse gas.
Promoting soil health and fertility with The Good Growth Plan 
, we support commercial activities that promote soil health and fertility, while helping it to reduce, capture and store carbon more effectively. One way to prevent carbon from being released from the soil is through conservation agriculture practices such as minimum soil disturbance, permanent soil cover (e.g. crop residues or cover crops), and crop rotation. Not tilling the soil also prevents the passing of heavy machinery on the field that burn fossil fuels. This means farmers can grow more crops, while keeping carbon in the soil and releasing less fuel emissions in the air. 
Heavy rains, floods and drought can all disrupt the physical nature of soil, making it susceptible to runoff and erosion. Our work to improve the biodiversity of farm landscapes, such as the planting of trees and other field margins, helps the soil’s structure be more resilient to the effects of severe weather. As part of The Good Growth Plan, we’ve committed to 
improve the fertility of 10 million hectares of farmland by 2020

The Congress presents a unique opportunity to showcase innovative and transformative business solutions to conservation, management of natural resources and sustainable socio-economic development. Our Head of Environmental Policy, Romano DeVivo, will be presenting on a series of initiatives we are taking as part of our Good Growth Plan to rescue farmland from degradation and to enhance the biodiversity of agricultural landscapes.
Tackling land degradation will be a large focus of our discussions at the event as we share and seek feedback from the environmental community on ways agriculture can be more sustainable. These include on-farm solutions for conservation agriculture, climate-smart agriculture, minimum tillage and and better landscape connectivity. Together with the Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and the WBCSD, we partner on the Soil Leadership Academy. The Academy will conduct a training workshop at the congress where we will be discussing next steps in our work toward a land-degradation neutral world.

Agriculture uses about 70 percent of the world’s fresh water. Shortages and changes in water availability pose significant challenges to food security. They affect growing seasons, pests and crop productivity, hindering farmers’ ability to produce food for a growing population. 
We encourage growers to adopt conservation agriculture practices, which help them optimize water use, increase soil water holding capacity, reduce water runoff and build crop resilience to changing weather patterns. We measure what can be achieved on farms through our Good Growth Plan. 
Water availability also impacts our own operations, especially in water-stressed locations. Our manufacturing sites continuously look for ways to further optimize water use; but our main focus is currently on more efficient water use in our seed supply chain, which is our principal water-using activity. 
 and submission to the 
 (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project).
In our Good Growth Plan, we’ve committed to increase the average productivity of the world's major crops by 20 percent by 2020 without using more land, water or inputs. We believe we’re helping farmers use water more efficiently and adapt to changing weather patterns. 
Farmers must have the right tools and skills to prosper. We have products available – and in the pipeline – that improve the water productivity of plants and increase tolerance to drought and heat.  Weed control using herbicides lowers the need for tillage, leaves roots in the soil and improves water absorption. Efficient irrigation systems deliver water to roots, and planting grasses or wild flowers around fields helps keep water in the soil. In combination, these practices dramatically reduce surface evaporation and water runoff.   
 corn hybrids, can help produce reliable yields in drier and semi-arid conditions. Our HYVIDO
 hybrid barley seeds offer farmers consistently higher yields. Their root systems form earlier, with bigger and more numerous roots leading to stronger hybrid vigor, better water and nutrient uptake and stronger growth under stressful conditions. 
When these products are combined with good management practices, agriculture is made more resilient to changes in climate and water availability. Our CONTIVO
 solution combines innovative seed technology with proven conservation tillage practices, suitable equipment and appropriate use of fertilizer together with crop protection protocols to protect soil health while maintaining high yields. 
Our GROMORE™ protocol provides guidance to smallholder growers for crop protection, seed, nutrients and water optimization and helps them overcome challenges resulting from water scarcity, labor shortages and productivity.
We continue to partner with growers and organizations around the world to research and promote further innovative solutions for water protection.
We are focusing on more efficient water use in field production, including sustainable water abstraction rates. So far, we’ve completed a water footprint study across our seed production supply chains, as well as our own sites, and established a reporting framework for field production. We’ve undertaken water risk assessments for crops in high-risk areas as a basis for setting management plans for optimizing water use in these areas. And by metering and measuring in more sophisticated ways, we’re increasing our understanding of the balance between rain-fed and irrigation-fed water use in fields, and how to optimize it. We aim to implement water management plans for all our field production in high-risk areas by 2020.
Reducing the amount of water consumed across our manufacturing sites is also critical to helping conserve water and reduce costs. Our environmental management system monitors global water consumption and helps us identify opportunities to reduce our impact, especially in water-scarce areas. The health, safety and environment assessments we carry out at our sites include assessments of their approach to water management.

In Bangladesh, field representatives have turned typical sales visits into opportunities for training smallholders on using crop protection safely. They’ve adapted their sales pitches to feature instruction on the ‘5 Golden Rules’ of safe use.
Safety instruction is tailored to the needs of local smallholders, and reinforced through highly visual training materials, posters, leaflets and interactive demonstrations.
As a result, we’re able to train more smallholders on how to stay safe while supporting them to increase crop productivity.

On August 28, 2018, announced that it is entering a three month period of consultation and stakeholder engagement in an effort to learn and build a shared vision for the future of sustainable agriculture.
At today, we are very proud of our history and the positive impact we’ve had on agriculture, over many years. Now, five years into 
, we want to take our contribution further and work with stakeholders on how we can build even more viable, productive and resilient farms using modern agricultural technologies. 
There are many individuals and organizations working towards solutions in this area, and as a company we need to align our role with the roles of others and better understand the expectations of our stakeholders. Through our listening sessions, we want to start building consensus on how a future sustainable agriculture and food system could look and from there, identify how our own efforts can accelerate change and move beyond where we stand today.
These listening sessions will take different forms, including roundtables and one-to-one conversations, and we will reach out directly to engage a cross section of those with a stake in the future of sustainable agriculture. Once the listening period comes to a close in November 2018, we will establish where we can best focus our own efforts towards sustainable agriculture and plan the next evolution of our successful Good Growth Plan beyond 2020. 
We hope these sessions will encourage open dialogue and a shared vison built on common ground – and ultimately increase confidence in farming and innovation in agriculture.
By early 2019, we expect to be able to announce how we will move forward in support a shared vision for the future of sustainable agriculture.

How the people behind The Good Growth Plan are helping rescue more farmland
is one of the many real people behind 
 His family farm in Hungary grows a variety of crops using our 
, which helps growers adopt conservation agriculture practices to reduce erosion and maintain soil health. Throughout the year, our field experts and CONTIVO
 advisors give him advice on how to manage the soil. This involves reducing weed growth through the use of crop protection and not through tilling the field. Less tillage reduces the number of passes on the field by the cultivator, so the soil stays in place, reducing erosion, compaction and soil runoff.
In Hungary, this type of soil management is crucial due to severe weather patterns like record-setting rains and droughts. Too much rain can wash soil away, too little can dry it out. Better soil conservation practices produce healthier yields. It’s not only good for the 
farmland - but for his productivity as well.
At Syngenta, we made a commitment to 
 of farmland by 2020. On the ground, we’ve worked together with farmers to create sustainable cropping systems, helping growers like 
Péter improve soil, yields, and livelihoods. We’ve also partnered with leading policy and decision makers, together with the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), providing farmers with the support they need to take care of their land and their business.
"If we take good care of our soil, it’s not only good from the environmental aspect, but can improve our productivity."

Fertile soil is the foundation of sustainable agriculture. But poor farming practices and extreme weather lead to erosion and infertility. In Eastern Russia, we are helping farmers switch from traditional plowing to new techniques that preserve soil and increase growers’ yields.
Working with local universities, we educate farmers in minimum tillage, which avoids churning up the earth. Soil retains moisture and porosity, as the passages made by root systems, worms and insects are undisturbed.
Minimum tillage, along with crop rotation, is leading to cost-effective, high-quality production. In 2015, we held four events connecting 245 farmers with scientists and employees. So far, the project involves seven farms covering 464,000 hectares.

increased productivity can make a big difference in their ability to pay school fees, which are typically due in October, just after the start of the main harvest. In cocoa-producing communities, access and means to attend school can be a significant challenge.  
To help cocoa growers in Côte d’Ivoire to improve their yields and secure a more stable income, we’ve partnered with Cargill on a project named “Yiri+”. “Yiri” is the word for “tree” in one of the local languages, symbolizing our aim to make cocoa trees more productive for growers. The project trains farmers in disease and pest management, as well as safe product use and good storage practices.
Madelaine Tawa Oulé, a smallholder in the Tiassalé region, participating in Yiri+ has helped improve the productivity of her farm. Her extra earnings have increased her ability to educate her children and support her family. “Through the solutions proposed by Syngenta, notice a difference: the leaves of the plants are now strong, beautiful and still green despite the drought”, she said. “More pods on my plot are beautiful and shiny.”

ten years ago, she participated in the Fair Labor program, a partnership between us and the Fair Labor Association. Through the program, she was trained on ending child labor, workers’ rights, and issues of health and safety. She was encouraged to send her children to school.
Since then, her children have graduated and her business has grown – the higher income has enabled her to double the size of her land and renovate and furnish the family home. Renukamma is now a fair labor advocate in her community, motivating others to adopt standards of fair labor and safety measures, including the use of protective equipment and safe storage practices.
As part of our commitment to

Operation Pollinator is helping growers in China improve their kiwi fruit yields and quality with a program to support bee pollination 
In the kiwi fruit orchards of Sichuan province, China, plant pollination used to be done by hand, and was time-consuming, labor-intensive and costly. Because female kiwi flowers are not naturally attractive to bees, bee pollination is a challenge – but a necessary one: kiwi plants pollinated by bees produce higher yields and better quality fruit that have more juice and seeds. 
When the Sichuan Huasheng Agriculture Company (a major kiwi supplier in China) wanted to improve bee pollination on their plantations, they turned to us to help implement our 
 program. This global pollinator initiative helps growers plant flowering field margins on and adjacent to their farms, which creates environments in which pollinators flourish: they provide a range of foraging habitats with diverse, rich nectar and pollen nutrition, as well as adequate nesting areas.
Through establishing a partnership with a leading bee research institution, the Institute of Apiculture Research (IAR) at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences in Beijing, we were able to bring bees to the kiwi orchards, raising yields, producing better quality fruits and improving our customer’s experience. Tailored protocols for the kiwi orchards were integrated with training, stewardship and the use of the right protocols and products.
Not only has this approach benefited growers, but it highlights our expertise in the Chinese fruit production market. The fruit sector is developing, moving towards standardized methods to ensure consistency and food quality. This opens up potential for us to provide tailored solutions to growers that integrate biodiversity enhancement and soil health and fertility solutions into our commercial offers. 
Mr. Bai Feng, General Manager of Sichuan Huasheng, said of the partnership, “The collaboration with and the on Hives on Farms and Operation Pollinator projects opens a new chapter and new ways of thinking in our production operations. Originally we adopted manual pollination, which took a lot of efforts with high labor and operating cost. However, after two years of implementation of the projects, we achieved great collaboration with Syngenta.”

is committed to helping farmers adopt sustainable agricultural practices and technology to mitigate climate change and provide safe and nutritious food for a growing population. 
Using our experience, knowledge, collaborations, products and data-based services, we help farmers address climate change.
Our changing climate is hindering farmers’ ability to grow food for a rapidly-increasing population. Changes in temperature and the frequency and severity of droughts and floods can reduce crop yields. Warmer, wetter climates allow weeds, pests and fungi to thrive, threatening yields. Rising CO2 levels reduce the nutritional value of major food crops.
Farming itself also contributes to climate change -  agriculture directly contributes 12 percent of annual greenhouse gas emissions (mainly CO2 emissions from farm machinery fuel use, nitrous oxide emissions from fertilizer, and methane emissions from livestock and rice cultivation) while contributing further emissions due to land clearance.
What can be done? With the right knowledge, practices and technologies, farmers can mitigate carbon emissions and become more resilient to extreme weather and other effects of climate change. Improving the efficiency and productivity of food production systems through better management practices and improved input technologies can go a long way to reducing emissions.
The goal for the agricultural sector is to sequester and store more carbon in soils than is produced by farming. By enhancing soil health and fertility, farmers can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from farming and increase the amount of carbon sequestered in the soil.
 – sustainable soil management practices, optimized water use, and improved crop technologies. As a leader in agricultural inputs research and development, is well placed to help farmers adopt so they can provide enough safe and nutritious food for a growing population while taking care of the planet.
Brings all nations into a common cause to make ambitious efforts to combat climate change and adapt to its effects, with enhanced support to assist developing countries to do so. 
Our commitment is to improve the fertility of 10 million hectares of farmland on the brink of degradation.

Syngenta’s onsite gardens highlight our commitment to enhancing pollinator habitats and supporting biodiversity 
Pollinators are critical to sustain crop yields and quality, but their populations can dwindle when they lack appropriate forage and habitat areas in agricultural and urban environments. Which is why we’ve planted new pollinator gardens at our corporate locations in Minnetonka, Minnesota; Greensboro, North Carolina; and Research Triangle Park (RTP), North Carolina. These gardens feature native plants that attract butterflies, bees, hummingbirds and other pollinators. 
On a small scale, the gardens mirror our 
 program, a program we initiated more than 15 years ago that uses native flowering margins to enhance the environment, and put back into nature what was disappearing from the landscape.  “The gardens fit very well with our goals for employee engagement, education, biodiversity enhancement and local outreach,” says Volker Mittendorf, Ph.D., Molecular Analytics Group Leader at in The gardens also reflect the global work we are doing to 
“Operation Pollinator has been one of the big success stories in our ongoing work with sustainability,” says Jill Wheeler, sustainable productivity head for Syngenta, North America. To date, has established Operation Pollinator sites in the on more than 350 golf courses and 7,000 acres of farmland. Like the Operation Pollinator plots on farms and 
, the on-site gardens feature plant varieties native to each location. For example, the garden at the Minnetonka facility, includes coneflower, bee balm and other types of mint plants, wild quinine, yellow Indian grass, Appalachian sunflower and milkweed.
Employees and visitors at the three locations can now enjoy a break during the workday while gaining a greater appreciation of the important role that pollinators play in propagating plants.

© 2019 SyngentaAgriculture and climate change
We recognize the challenges climate change poses for agriculture – and the contribution we can make to tackle it.  changing climate affects growing seasons, water availability, pests and crop productivity – hindering farmers’ ability to produce better and more abundant food for a growing population. It also impacts our own operations, through altered weather patterns and water availability.
The 2015 Paris Agreement builds on the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), bringing nations together in efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to a changing climate. While agriculture is not formally part of the agreement, the parties agree on the strategic role it plays in mitigating and adapting to climate change. 
In this spirit, we encourage growers to adopt climate-smart practices that help them to optimize inputs, reduce soil-based carbon emissions and build crop resilience to changing weather patterns. We work with a wide range of stakeholders, transferring knowledge and achieving results on the ground. And we measure what can be achieved on farms through our Good Growth Plan . 
We report on our actions and performance in our Sustainable Business Report and submission to the  (formerly Carbon Disclosure Project).
We’re making a positive contribution to tackling climate change by helping farmers mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to a changing climate. 
Soil is a major storage area for carbon in our ecosystem; when it’s degraded or disturbed, carbon is released into the atmosphere. 
Our products, combined with improved input technologies and better management practices, are strengthening agriculture against both the causes and the effects of climate change.
Drought tolerant seeds, such as our ARTESIAN® corn hybrids, can help produce reliable yields in drier and semi-arid conditions, reducing the need for new arable land. 
Reducing emissions in our own operations
Reducing the amount of energy consumed across our operations is critical to helping us cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and costs. Our environmental management system monitors our performance in energy efficiency and carbon emissions and helps us identify opportunities to reduce our impacts. We have energy efficiency programs at all our sites. These are continuous and permanent: when targets are met, we will set more demanding ones, and we are focusing on the areas with the greatest potential for improvement. In 2016, we completed EU-standard energy-efficiency audits at 30 sites, covering well over 80 percent of our energy use. These audits enabled us to identify the actions and investments offering the greatest opportunities for improvement, and we have developed action plans accordingly.
We have a long tradition of assessing and auditing our chemical suppliers’ compliance with our health, safety and quality standards. In 2015, we joined the chemical industry’s Together for Sustainability initiative, which pools the resources of its member companies to optimize the efficiency and frequency of supplier audits and assessments. These include evaluation of suppliers’ action to track and reduce emissions. GHGs associated with site processes and activities, transport fuel use both on and offsite, agricultural activities and other sources are expected to be monitored and routinely assessed.  
We are also committed to long-term CO2 intensity reduction for all our land, sea and air distribution logistics. We are currently implementing a global program with partners who integrate and co-ordinate all logistics operations across supply chains to optimize processes and gain economies of scale. This will improve energy and cost efficiency, compliance and CO2 emissions.
Collaboration is at the heart of what we do. Our ambition is to support a step change in collaboration among governments, NGOs, business, financial and donor institutions, schools and universities.
Working with policy makers and researchers
We support organizations such as the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification ( ), the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center ( ) and the International Rice Research Institute ( ), and initiatives such as the World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s Climate Smart Agriculture group, which are promoting sustainable agricultural practices, resilient food systems and social policies.
We’re a signatory to the World Economic Forum’s Alliance of Climate Leaders . This coalition believes the private sector has a responsibility to engage in global efforts to reduce emissions, and to help lead the global transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy. For our part, we aim to draw attention to the role agriculture plays in mitigating the effects of climate change and helping rural communities to adapt.
is also a member of the Cool Farm Alliance and Field-to-Market . These organizations provide science-based sustainable agriculture assessment tools to track emissions on the farm and identify improvement opportunities through climate-smart agricultural practices. For example, we have integrated Field to Market’s sustainability metrics into our Land.db software, which provides farm management solutions to farmers.

in Liaoning province, China, she was trained by around ten years ago on 
how pesticides can be applied and stored safely
 Since then, she has become a leader in her community helping to spread the word on the safe use of pesticides.
She’s so passionate about helping growers protect themselves and the environment that she does so in her spare time, on top of her day to day work. Using the 5 Golden Rules, Shi Lijie leads trainings on behalf of to educate farmworkers.
As part of The Good Growth Plan, we made a commitment 
 on labor safety by 2020. To reach this target, we’ve revised our protocols to ensure that the knowledge our trainers share has a lasting impact. We’ve also been developing new guidelines and tools in six languages so that more people like Shi can learn how to make a world of difference.
“especially hope our local farmers can all reach a high level of safe use of pesticides. And this way, we’ll live more safely and happily and joyfully. hope everybody values food safety as much as do, and values the safe use of pesticides as well.”

Prince Edward Island is Canada’s largest potato-growing province, famous for its red, sandy soil. But heavy rainfall and a vast system of waterways mean that farmers need to take precautions to stop tilled soil from running into streams and rivers. One important practice that supports stream environments and reduces the risk of soil runoff is planting strips of vegetation along the edges of farm properties and waterways.
 These areas not only help to stop field soil slipping into waterways, but also provide food and habitat for a variety of wildlife and pollinating insects.
The Prince Edward Island Stream Restoration Project – conducted in partnership with experts from the Kensington North Watersheds Association and the Bedeque Bay Environmental Management Association – supports farmers in implementing practices that enhance biodiversity and keep the soil where it belongs: in their fields.

Growers worldwide are increasingly confronted with, pressure on natural resources like soil, water and biodiversity. They need to achieve high yields, while also taking care of the environment. These two aims are often thought to be mutually exclusive – but growers know that sustainable practices can go hand-in-hand with agriculture using modern technologies. To demonstrate this, we’ve brought together growers to form the Interra Farm Network, which helps NGOs, students, decision-makers and other farmers get first-hand insights into sustainable practices through on-farm demonstrations and farm tours. For visitors, seeing is believing on the farm.
Our Interra Farm Network showcases farms that integrate the safe and effective use of crop protection products with environmental and conservation practices.  As our partners on this initiative, growers share knowledge of their working farm and allow groups of visitors to tour their land to experience sustainable productive agriculture for themselves.  For example, visitors to an Interra Farm can see wildflower margins and count the number of bee species present. Nearby, they can examine a Heliosec device collecting pesticide waste for safe disposal and learn about safety equipment for handling pesticides and treated seed.
The eight farms in our network are in Belgium, Portugal, Poland, Czech Republic, Italy, Hungary and Morocco and are of different sizes, productions and environmental characteristics. More than 4,000 people have visited the farms to learn about sustainable agriculture and safe use practices.
Our Interra farm in Belgium has planted flowering field margins, trees and hedge rows on about 20 hectares of the farm. This has helped to maintain a high level of biodiversity across the farm by providing food and habitat for pollinators like bees and butterflies. In turn, the pollinators return to the field, helping to pollinate crops and increase yields.
The Interra Farm in Portugal is managed in association with the University of Lisbon. Every year, we sponsor a competition among students to test them on pest identification and technical skills. As future agronomists, they learn practical advice on how to properly clean and calibrate spray equipment, as well as manage empty containers and promote the safe use of pesticides
The main purpose of the competition, “24 Hours Agriculture” is to inspire and train the next generation of agronomists.
Our Interra farm in Hungary converted 600 hectares of traditional tilled soil to conservation tillage by adopting our solution.
The farm showcases soil management techniques such as crop rotations, which protect soil from erosion while also helping to maintain soil biodiversity.
For growers, the simple act of keeping a shelf clear and organized can be a first step in staying safe. Our Interra farm in Morocco demonstrates how to keep product organized – which helps product longevity and performance while also preventing unnecessary contamination and accidental spills.  Visiting growers are encouraged to replicate the model of organization on their own farms, which takes a relatively small investment in capital.

How the people behind The Good Growth Plan are helping empower smallholders
Priscar Mwangangi is one of the many real people behind 
 She grows tomatoes, peppers and beans on a small plot of land in Kenya. Heavy rains, crop disease and low-yielding seeds used to keep her from achieving her dream of growing her crops all year-round. Without crop protection and high-quality seeds, an entire season’s work could be lost.
As part of a program in her community, Priscar leads field demonstrations to share her knowledge, particularly on high-quality seeds, which she credits as a major factor in her own success. Fellow growers in the program are also trained on how to use pesticides in the right way, including the use of protective equipment and the appropriate disposal of  empty containers.
 like Priscar and enable them to increase productivity by 50 percent as part of our Good Growth Plan. But our goal isn’t just to reach smallholders - we want to empower them. That’s why we’re working with partners around the world to give more smallholders the farming knowhow they need – as well as access to agronomic knowledge and quality crop inputs.
"What would like to see in my farm from next year is to see myself producing and harvesting throughout the year…If you need tomatoes, round the year, this is where to come. If you need peppers, round the year, this is where to come. Through the Good Growth Plan am sure am going to do that."

By 2050, the world’s farmers and growers will need to feed around two billion more people. And they’ll need to do so as the land available for agriculture diminishes. It’s a serious challenge and global food security hinges on it.
Our research and development, the products we bring to market, and the knowledge and expertise we provide to growers are helping to release the full potential of crops all over the world. 
Our ambition is to bring greater food security in an environmentally sustainable way to an increasingly populous world by creating a worldwide step change in farm productivity.  
We work in more than 90 countries with farms of all sizes, from smallholdings of less than 2 hectares to sustainable industrial farms.
The Good Growth Plan is having an increasing influence on our business and taking us nearer to realizing our ambition.
We apply world-class science and the most productive research and development in the industry to achieve a step change in agricultural productivity.  
We use our deep understanding of crops to develop a leading portfolio of crop protection and seeds, and combine products and agronomic know-how to deliver integrated offers.
Our teams around the world combine their local knowledge with our global assets and expertise, tailoring solutions that create value for growers. 
We know that meeting our ambition must be a combined effort. Our open, collaborative culture has made us a trusted and sought-after partner:  we have built a rich network of productive alliances with academic institutions, other agricultural businesses and growers.  These relationships leverage our own resources – accelerating our innovation, sharpening our production efficiency and increasing our flexibility.

is a global company and our operations span many different functions and working environments. To maintain the success of our business, we need these diverse operations to work together seamlessly. From developing our products to ensuring they’re used safely on the farm, we’re committed to excellence across all our operations.
Our strategy for reducing external impacts is to identify and focus on the areas where there is greatest opportunity for improvement. Since 2015, we have been working on five focus areas. Just as The Good Growth Plan seeks to increase the sustainability of our offers in the field by 2020, this work aims to secure the long-term viability of our own activities.
Three of the focus areas concern the way we use resources: energy, waste and water. Our energy and waste impacts come primarily from our production sites, and we’ve focused on those that account for most of our energy footprint. While some of our manufacturing sites use large amounts of water, our greatest water-consuming activity by far is seed production. Although we continue to work on reducing our industrial water consumption, we’ve focused on understanding and managing water use on our seed supply farms.
The two other focus areas concern the way we work with suppliers and logistics service providers. We’ve been evolving our operating model to put greater emphasis on partnerships, and external suppliers now account for a large and growing part of our footprint. So we’re finding ways of helping them to manage their environmental and social impacts. As well as working with our production suppliers, we’re also transforming the way we transport our products by land, sea and air, to reduce both CO
As we increase our reliance on external suppliers, we seek out partners who are prepared to work towards our own standards of operation. We support them in driving improvement, because collaboration is the key to results.
To help make our procurement more sustainable, we’ve joined the chemical industry’s Together for Sustainability (TfS) program. This enables chemical companies to collaborate on improving the sustainability of their supply chains. Tfhas established a standard for auditing and assessing suppliers on social, environmental and ethical issues following the principles of the Global Compact, Responsible Care and the International Labor Organization. In assessing and improving the standards of the companies we work with, we apply a tiered approach – focusing our resources on the areas of highest risk and opportunity.
Our Process Safety Management program aims to drive commitment, understanding and improvement of safety standards at our chemical manufacturers through a combination of training and auditing.
safety experts conduct in-depth site audits focused on health, safety and environmental standards. We then help suppliers to make the improvements they recommend.
On-site audits and written assessments cover a broad range of social, environmental and ethical issues. The results are shared across the members of the initiative to improve efficiency for our suppliers and us. 
All suppliers are expected to act in accordance with our environmental, safety and ethical standards and principles.
We have worked with the Fair Labor Association (FLA) since 2004 to develop and manage our Fair Labor Program. This requires seed suppliers to comply with labor rights codes in nine areas: employment relationship; non-discrimination; harassment and abuse; forced labor; child labor; freedom of association and collective bargaining; health, safety and environment; hours of work; and compensation. 
Our flower business is working to obtain and Risk Assessment On Social Practice (G.R.A.S.P.) for all our own and third-party commercial flower farms. is a standard for safe and sustainable food production. assesses social practices on the farm, addressing specific aspects of workers’ health, safety and welfare.
The Code of Conduct gives a clear statement of our commitment to health, safety and the environment (HSE). As a leading global company committed to sustainable agriculture, we have a responsibility to protect the environment, and to ensure the health and safety of our employees, customers and the communities in which we operate. Our performance also plays a key part in developing and protecting our reputation with all our stakeholders.
At Syngenta, we are all responsible for health and safety. We have a Group Policy and Standards document to guide us. It outlines our expectation that employees will take responsible management into consideration in all their activities, from product development to use and beyond.

How the people behind The Good Growth Plan are helping make crops more efficient
Tanner Tanke is one of the many real people behind 
. His farm in North Dakota, grows soybeans, wheat and sugar beets. As a Good Growth Plan reference farmer, Tanner tracks the resources it takes to grow his crops. He’s found fewer passes over the field with heavy equipment has saved him fuel and labor. Knowing the efficiency of his farm inputs helps him not only keep an eye on his bottom line, but also improve the sustainability of his farm. This 
helps him get the most out of every hectare.
We’re working with farmers like Tanner to increase the average productivity of the 
world’s major crops by 20%
 by 2020, without using more land, water or inputs. To test and measure what’s possible, we’ve created a network of reference farms to trial and better understand more efficient farming practices. We’re sharing this 
 with growers, academics, and governments so that everyone can benefit as quickly as possible from our learnings.
He’s growing crops more efficiently to protect the environment and make his farm more profitable so that it’s around for his five-year-old son in years to come.
“think it’s important to grow more crops with less inputs and less land just because land is expensive to buy or rent. You can produce more to increase your bottom line.”

Collaboration is at the heart of what we do. We encourage our employees to collaborate with universities, NGOs, governments and communities to harness a broader body of knowledge and resources in addressing global challenges. We engage actively in global dialogue and work with partners to improve agricultural productivity, resource efficiency, ecosystem resilience, food safety and the wellbeing of rural communities.
We also collect feedback in a variety of ways. We listen to the grower community through satisfaction surveys and farmers’ direct contact with our sales teams on the ground. We conduct research to help us understand consumers’ perceptions of agriculture and related topics. We also engage directly with our employees and locally with the communities close to our operations. Through interaction with industry associations, non-governmental organizations and governments we gather feedback on our activities and monitor issues important to stakeholders. 
To make information about our activities more accessible to these stakeholders, we also publish answers to their most frequently asked questions under ‘
We believe it’s in our interests to listen to local communities and share knowledge, protect our common environment, promote health and improve their quality of life. Fostering open and constructive dialogue is part of every site manager’s job. We expect them to be visible, available and responsive to local concerns – whether these relate to the impact of our operations or to community needs. In addition to offering donations and facilities, we believe we contribute best when we transfer knowledge – applying the practical skills and expertise we’ve gained from our operations. 
Our Pangasinan site in the Philippines turned its surplus plastic bags into mats and tents for disaster relief and forged a partnership with the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation. This partnership enabled the site to reach more stakeholders and widen its influence in the community.
In Kunshan, China, we’re using our workplace expertise to build health, safety and environmental (HSE) awareness in the community and among our industrial neighbors. The Chinese government awarded our site 1 million yuan for leading this initiative, and chairs the local Committee.
Our global study found widespread recognition that producing more food for a growing population in an environmentally sustainable way will be one of the next decade’s most important global challenges.

By “non-financial information” we mean quantitative and qualitative information on the strategies, policies or activities we pursue towards our business, environmental and social goals. In reporting this, we focus on the aspects that are most material to our business and our stakeholders. 
Our corporate website and the Sustainable Business Report are our main vehicles for disclosing non-financial performance. We report our progress towards achieving our Good Growth Plan commitments as well as our performance on people, the sustainable management of our operations, and our business integrity activities. This reporting is guided by the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) principles, externally assured by Pwand approved by the Board of Directors. We disclose Good Growth Plan progress data using Open Data format so that it’s searchable, usable and shareable online.  
We’re a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and our Annual Review serves as our Communication on Progress (COP), in line with the principles. We also report greenhouse gas emissions and water use through the climate change and water programs of (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project).
To make information more accessible to stakeholders, we answer their frequently asked questions on our Questions about website and respond directly to questions and requests for information.
Our materiality matrix sets out the issues that we and our stakeholders see as most important. 
This helps us to keep alert to stakeholder concerns and expectations, as well as the issues that we believe present the greatest risks and opportunities for our business.
It’s updated annually to inform our external communication and reporting, and to help us allocate our resources where we can provide the most value to stakeholders. 
Non-financial information helps people to better understand our activities, challenges and opportunities. External stakeholders and internal managers use it to measure performance and make decisions about the company. 
We want them to have complete confidence in it. 
To establish sound internal controls for reporting non-financial information in our Sustainable Business Report, we’ve been guided by the principles outlined in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework and we’ve applied financial reporting concepts and practices. We designed and implemented an internal control environment supported by improved reporting processes and systems, clearly defined accountabilities and detailed documented procedures. We also developed a Sustainability Reporting Guideline to direct our non-financial reporting activities and extensively trained the individuals involved in reporting. Syngenta’s Board of Directors and management have set clear expectations about the importance of non-financial reporting and they ensure that associated internal controls are functioning properly. 
People want to be confident that the non-financial information in our Sustainable Business Report is robust and credible. External stakeholders and internal managers need reliable non-financial information to make decisions. So for many years we’ve ensured that this information is externally assured. 
This is conducted to “reasonable assurance” level – similar to that applied in financial audit – on our Good Growth Plan data and to “limited assurance” level for the progress data we report on our people, sustainable operations and business integrity activities. 
The level of assurance indicates the depth of the work the assurance provider undertakes and the degree of confidence information users can place in the assured information. reasonable assurance assessment is substantially larger in scope and it provides a stronger assurance opinion than a limited assurance assessment.  
We publish the opinion provided by the independent assurance provider in our

 (TNC), a global environmental non-profit organization, have been working together for over a decade on projects that support sustainable agricultural practices. Through our collaborative efforts, we have made a positive impact on farming in Brazil, China, and the United States. Examples of this work include: 
    In 2018, we launched sustainable agriculture demonstration projects in arid and semi-arid regions of China to promote soil health and productivity for potatoes. 
In 2015, we developed a new system of training, implementation, and measurement of best management practices in the Saginaw Bay Watershed in the state of Michigan to improve water quality and preserve natural habitat. In 2017, Syngenta, TNC, and the Kellogg Company received 
the Field to Market Collaboration of the Year award
 for outstanding partnership in advancing the sustainability of agriculture for work in the Saginaw Bay Watershed. 
In 2013, we introduced sustainable productive landscapes practices in Brazil to benefit integrated cattle grazing and crop production.  
In 2009, we launched the 
 initiative to promote sustainable soybean production in Brazil’s Mato Grosso state. Working with other companies and local government, we mapped 6 million hectares to encourage conservation and registration in the Rural Environmental Registry (CAR). Today, more than 90 percent of the region’s registerable area is in the CAR.
In 2007, we began mapping rural producers in Mato Grosso, Brazil to prevent deforestation and conversion of natural habitat for soy production.

The passion and diversity of our people are distinctive assets and key elements of our brand and culture. is not a place where simply doing a job is enough. It is vital that everyone has clarity about their own contribution and how we work together to achieve our goals. Our environment is intense and dynamic and we all need to be adaptable to change.
Our ambition and strategy are directed by our purpose, bringing plant potential to life. It inspires and guides our work. Our values articulate what we regard as being important and help us make decisions. Through our values, we express who we are and what we stand for:
We consider celebrating and sharing our achievements as an important element of our culture. In 2017, we launched a new global employee recognition program called Val-You that enables employees to recognize other colleagues for making important contributions that drive our business performance, while bringing our values to life.
We need to attract, retain and motivate a workforce that will deliver the innovation required to grow more from less. We do this by taking an open and proactive approach to recruitment, and offering attractive development opportunities to ensure we retain talent.
Available positions are advertised globally, and through local internet sites, and we use social media to promote opportunities as widely as we can. We engage graduates through job fairs and career days, and offer graduate programs throughout the business and across our global operations.
Our performance management and talent programs focus on defining goals that are right for the individual and our organization. We have corporate goals, against which all team and individual goals must align. We encourage ongoing dialogue between employees and line managers, by reinforcing a culture of continuous feedback. In 2018, we launched a new approach to ongoing dialogue to ensure we continuously raise the performance of our people while providing them differentiated development paths. These dialogue sessions between employee and line manager, called Pause2Talk, are forward-looking and help employees understand how their individual contribution helps to raise the company’s performance.
Our talent programs assess an employee’s potential and help determine their development needs and career planning requirements. We focus on the individual, ensuring that each person develops both personally and professionally in line with their own needs and aspirations, and those of the organization.
In 2017, our employee turnover rate was 11.3%. This figure includes voluntary and involuntary leavers and those employees leaving the organization due to restructuring. The proportion of voluntary leavers was 5.2%. Our leadership teams regularly review retention rates and we focus on employee engagement, development opportunities, and offering competitive incentive packages to help us retain the best people.
We maintain a formal performance management process, which aligns individual, team and organizational goals, improves performance, and supports individual development.
Through this process, we support personal development and recognize individual contribution. The process is owned by line managers with support from our Human Resources teams. All employees are expected to take personal accountability for their performance and development using our framework of setting goals, planning appropriate development opportunities and assessing performance at year-end. This framework is also linked to our Short-Term Incentive program.
The performance criteria are based on an individual’s contribution throughout the year. The contribution of each individual is recognized by assessing the “What”, which describes the tangible deliverables linked to individual and team objectives, and the “How”, which describes the behaviors and ways of working in alignment with our values and leadership model.
Is sustainability incorporated into Syngenta's performance management systems?
developed The Good Growth Plan as a measure for the sustainability of its strategy. All employees, including senior executives, are subject to a formal annual performance management process, which aligns individual, team and organizational objectives. Active participation in The Good Growth Plan is bringing the concept of sustainability to life across the company and is heightening awareness of the importance of each individual’s work.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan for the Executives is subject to secondary performance measures. Key elements in this are performance measures related to The Good Growth Plan.
At Syngenta, our Employee Value Proposition (EVP) sets out what we stand for and offer as an employer, and what we expect from current and potential employees. offers a combination of monetary and non-monetary rewards. Our compensation principles provide a transparent, performance-oriented and market-competitive compensation framework for all employees, including senior executives. The non-monetary elements allow to differentiate itself from competitors and play a key role in attracting potential and retaining current employees. We offer attractive career development programs to allow our people to grow personally and professionally and a stimulating and collaborative work environment where diverse backgrounds are valued and talents are nurtured.
At the same time, we expect from our employees to proactively plan and manage their career development in close collaboration with their line manager. Our employees are also expected to contribute to the success of the company through their open participation, co-creation and innovation.
The serves to strengthen Syngenta’s position as an employer in a competitive marketplace. It supports our culture and enables us to attract, motivate, engage and retain highly qualified employees to deliver the strategic plans and goals of the company.
Through a combination of global and local programs, we recognize employee contribution through incentives, development programs, as well as through our cultural programs. One example of the latter is the Awards which gives teams around the world the opportunity to gain recognition for particular projects that bring our values to life. More than 6,700 stories have been shared since the Awards began in 2005, demonstrating innovation that achieved major breakthroughs, determination to overcome challenges, or care and concern for the world and the environment.
What are the elements of compensation at Syngenta?
We reward our employees based on their performance and in line with local market conditions in each country where we operate. Our compensation system links compensation to both individual performance and the financial success of our company. The compensation package we offer includes:
Employees are subject to a formal annual performance management process. Annual performance ratings influence both the annual base salary and variable compensation elements of our overall compensation structure. Our performance management system also emphasizes the need for coaching and development alongside appraisal.
Variable compensation, in the form of short- and long-term incentive programs, is determined by the level and scope of the individual’s job, as well as the external market value of the respective job, the location, business performance and individual performance. Both the short-term and long-term incentives are paid in cash.
regularly measures employee engagement, well-being and other indices through a comprehensive online survey, called Pulse Survey. It can be complemented by subject specific surveys throughout the year, called Quick Pulse surveys. This approach allows every employee to share their views anonymously and give leaders actionable insights.
We actively focus on developing engagement activities to create links between our strategy and employees’ individual contribution. This includes:
Local events such as site town-hall meetings, leadership meetings and focus groups, which provide targeted feedback and insights into wider issues at local and regional levels.
Worldwide leader-led meetings, which provide employees the opportunity to learn about our strategy, culture and values, and offer them a forum to engage with leaders and voice their opinion.
Leader breakfast sessions at our head office in Basel, which provide a relaxed and informal environment where employees can talk to members of our Executive Team and senior leaders and discuss hot topics, ask questions and take part in active discussions.
The performance management process also provides formal opportunities to create links with our strategy and employees’ contribution, aligning individual, team and organizational goals.
We have a global employee recognition program called Val-You that enables employees to recognize other colleagues across the company for making important contributions that drive our business performance, while bringing our values to life.
We provide an internal social media channel for employees to share best practice and connect widely across the organization. It also gives leaders a new way to get feedback, and to recognize achievements and celebrate success.
The output of these engagement activities is then used to inform our strategies – for example a focus on cultural issues led to further developments in our values and leadership model. Our change management processes also help us collect employee feedback and engagement during any periods of change in the business.
We value diversity and inclusion as reflected in our corporate values and leadership commitments. Embracing the unique perspectives and capabilities of our employees is helping to catalyze innovation, maximize performance and create business value.
diverse workforce and an inclusive workplace environment are enablers of our ambition to be the most collaborative and trusted team in agriculture, providing leading seeds and crop protection innovations to enhance the prosperity of farmers, wherever they are, in an environmentally sustainable way. Our employees reflect the diversity of our customers, the markets where we operate and the communities which we serve.
We assess our diversity and inclusion progress through related metrics and our employee surveys. Relevant key performance indicators - such as the proportion of women and number of nationalities represented in senior management - are published in our Sustainable Business Report (p. 42) .
We encourage personal and professional growth through a culture of continuous learning. Our global reach and the wide range of diverse careers we offer provide employees with the opportunity to excel and fulfill their potential. Individual employees produce personal development plans suited to their own career aspirations and developmental requirements. These development plans are discussed and agreed with line managers and included in the development and planning part of the annual performance planning process.
We place great emphasis on developing our leadership and people management skills. Working with global external partners we offer world-class development pathways for leaders based on training, virtual learning and coaching experiences. Rigorous assessment and feedback help leaders understand the requirements of their role and specific development priorities. There is customized development for our most promising talent across global, regional and territory leadership populations. Our learning and development teams are constantly working on new development experiences to build the capabilities required by our business strategy and industry. For example, our MyCrop training program ensures employees understand farming requirements from the perspective of the grower.
We also offer specialist training programs for key business functions. For example, our Commercial Excellence team designs programs; self, virtual or face-to-face learning to provide a deep understanding and application of concepts relating to sales, marketing, pricing, integrated business planning and customer operations. The ultimate objective is to support the strategy and unleash the full potential of our people.
Our approach to leadership development recognizes the importance of tailoring it to the scope and complexity of specific leadership roles.
We believe that leadership development happens in many different ways – through learning from role-specific experiences and challenges, from feedback, coaching or mentoring from peers and other senior leaders. This development is supported by our formal Global Leadership Development Programs.
The Global Leadership Development Programs consist of a series of distinct developmental pathways based on the level of leadership role. For example, all first line managers are offered to participate in a 24-month development pathway including 360° feedback assessment, training, coaching and on-line learning support on key areas of management. Senior managers and Executive leaders are also offered customized development tailored to their role. We also have specialized programs for emerging leadership talent designed to accelerate their readiness for the next stage of their career.
How does measure performance in learning and development?
We measure performance in learning and development through metrics such as investment in leadership and talent development. These are reported in our Sustainable Business Report (p. 42) .
What is Syngenta’s commitment to health and safety?
The health and safety of our people is our first priority and we seek to maintain an industry-leading approach to employee health and safety. Our values and Code of Conduct demonstrate our strong commitment to the health and safety of our employees, customers and the communities in which we operate.
We foster a culture where everyone is expected to take personal responsibility for their own health and safety. Our robust global health and safety policy and standards are communicated through local training programs at all our sites. We have a Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) management system in place and we monitor performance across all our operations. Each site reports health and safety performance on a monthly basis through our Health and Safety Reporting System.
How does measure its health and safety performance?
All our sites are required to report performance on a monthly basis through our Health and Safety Reporting System. Key performance indicators include near-miss occurrences, non-injury incidents, injury and illness rates, as well as first aid cases and cases related to illnesses and stress. We are committed to continuously invest to keep our recordable injury and illness rate (IIR) below our target of 0.5.
We report our health and safety performance for both permanent employees and contractors under our direct supervision in a consolidated way. We believe that, from a health and safety perspective, there is no difference between the two groups. For more information see our Sustainable Business Report (p. 41) .
Do the same health and safety policies, practices and support apply to both employees and contractors?
Contractors managed directly by (such as security services or contracted employees) are expected to uphold our policies on health and safety in the same way as our employees are. We also have policies to ensure that work carried out by any contractors is conducted with proper regard to the health and safety of workers and others. We provide relevant information and ensure that adequate management control systems are in place. We report our health and safety performance for permanent employees and contractors in a consolidated way, as we believe that, from a health and safety perspective, there is no difference between the two. For more information see our Sustainable Business Report (p. 30) .
Contractors managed through third parties are subject to our global requirements for suppliers which include health and safety. We also conduct and report on our health, safety, environment and quality assessments of chemical suppliers and warehouse and logistics service providers globally. For more information on these assessments and our approach to responsible supply chain, see Sustainable Business Report (p. 26)  and  (p. 32) .
What is Syngenta’s commitment to organizational health and employee wellbeing?
Our people’s passion and diversity are core assets and key elements of our brand. Respect for their health and wellbeing is a core value and our success is dependent on it.
Our commitment to the health of our people is an important part of our approach to corporate responsibility, and supports our ‘health through action’ value. Our Code of Conduct , supporting corporate policies, and codes of practice are clear on the importance of providing employees with a safe working environment.
We offer a range of wellbeing programs tailored to local needs, including sports centers, healthy options at staff restaurants, health checks, family counseling services and access to legal advice.
Syngenta’s comprehensive portfolios of crop protection, seed treatment and seed products provide growers around the world with efficient solutions to help them grow strong and healthy plants. 
We focus on major crops that make up the majority of global food production: cereals; corn; diverse field crops including sunflower; rice; soybean; specialty crops including coffee and cocoa; sugar cane and vegetables.
We also apply our world-leading agriculture technology in the Lawn and Garden market.
Read more about product brands and the crops we target.
Crop protection products are chemical or biological substances that protect crops from damage caused by biotic and abiotic stress. They control weeds, disease and insect pressure, and can mitigate climate stress. The widespread use of newer and more effective products since the middle of the twentieth century has increased food security and improved standards of living around the world.
Herbicides control weeds that compete with crops for light and nutrients. Without weed control, crop yield can be significantly reduced. Herbicides are categorized as selective herbicides, which control specific weeds without damaging the crop, and non-selective herbicides, which control all plants (if absorbed by green tissue).
Fungicides prevent and/or cure fungal diseases which can have severe adverse effects on crop yield and quality. Plant diseases are caused by a great variety of pathogens.
Insecticides control insects such as caterpillars and aphids that can significantly reduce crop yield and quality through their feeding.
Seed treatments are substances or physical processes applied to seeds or seedlings. They help to protect the seeds and assure optimum emergence of the crop. Application of a substance to seeds is a very targeted method of reducing pest and disease attacks on the growing plant.
Plant growth and stress regulators create a shorter, stronger plant, increase root mass, resulting in improved water and nutrient uptake and better drought-, heat-, and wind tolerance.
Plants themselves naturally produce a wide range of chemicals to protect themselves against pests, but these are not enough to prevent large losses of food crops. In fact, it is estimated that between 35% and 40% of all crops would be lost to insects, weeds and disease without appropriate pesticide use1. 
The effective use of pesticides helps growers to grow more from less, increasing food security for millions of people by reducing crop losses resulting from insects, weeds and diseases.
1Oerke and Dehne W; "Safeguarding Production – Losses in Major Crops and the Role of Crop Protection"; Crop Protection 23 (2004): 275-285.
Wasn’t food a lot healthier before the widespread use of pesticides?
Food was not healthier before pesticides: infestation with dangerous pests and disease was common and persistent. The use of pesticides has enabled farmers to produce a more abundant supply of safe, affordable, fresh food than ever before, supporting healthy diets around the world.
Pesticides themselves do not make food unhealthy and residues in fruit and vegetables are highly regulated to remain well within safety levels (see next question).
Do pesticides negatively impact human health or contaminate the environment?
Modern pesticides are designed with three things in mind – they must be safe, they must be specific to their target and they must be short-lived, breaking down harmlessly shortly after achieving their aim. They are only approved for use after extensive testing for any potential effect on human health or the environment.
Pesticide residues in food are highly regulated and constantly monitored. Maximum legal levels are typically 100 times lower than needed for safety and there is no evidence that the miniscule residue sometimes left on fruit and vegetables has any effect on human health.
All our products are also tested extensively to make sure that they do not have a negative impact on the environment, biodiversity or waterways when used as recommended. Pesticides can also bring environmental benefits by reducing the need for tilling thereby increasing soil vitality, reducing erosion, and improving the quality of the land. 
Is organic agriculture better than agriculture using new technologies?
Objective scientific research has led many food safety agencies around the world to conclude that organic food is not safer or more nutritious than food produced with agronomic practices that include the use of modern pesticides.
Contrary to common belief, organic farmers are allowed to use a range of pesticides and toxic chemicals on their crops – either those obtained from natural sources or those that are considered traditional practices.
Pesticides are developed to tackle specific issues in specific locations. Variations in climate or localized pest and diseases mean that a product used to treat crops in one country may not be suitable to treat the same crops in another country.
Regulations are often developed on a country level and regulatory bodies will only approve a product if there is a need for them in their country. This means that while a certain product has been approved for use in one location it will not necessarily be approved for use in another. This is not an indication of the safety of its ingredients or that a product has been ‘banned’ in a particular country, it is merely that it has not been registered or re-registered there.
For more than 50 years, the herbicide Atrazine has been used safely and effectively by farmers as a selective herbicide to control weeds in crops such as corn, sorghum and sugar cane.
Atrazine provides considerable advantages to farmers. It is a well-understood and affordable product – without it, a University of Chicago economist has estimated corn farming in the would cost up to $59 per acre more (representing a combination of alternative herbicide costs and reduced yield). Atrazine is also widely used in conservation tillage and non-till systems, which can reduce soil erosion by up to 90% – according to data from the Department of Agriculture – helping to preserve soil fertility and protect waterways from sediment.
Atrazine is one of the most studied agricultural chemicals. Nearly 7,000 studies and regulatory reviews from governments and independent agencies around the world — including the World Health Organization, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia, as well as the — support its safety. There is no evidence that atrazine adversely affects frogs or other wildlife. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) re-registered Atrazine in 2006 and began its review for re-registration in 2013.
Is involved in the production of seeds?
Seeds sales account for almost a quarter of Syngenta’s revenues. Our seed portfolio is one of the broadest in the industry including more than 200 product lines, and more than 6,800 varieties produced by around 38,000 seed suppliers around the world. We provide these seed suppliers with parent seeds of our proprietary seed varieties, which they grow and harvest before selling the harvested seeds back to us.
Our seed portfolio includes field crops - such as corn, soybean, rice and cereals – and vegetables. We have a significant market share across many of these crops and we are continually working to develop new and better seed varieties.
‘Conventional’ breeding generally refers to plant breeding without the use of molecular biology or biotechnology techniques. It involves the crossing of carefully chosen parent plants, then evaluating the resulting offspring for desired phenotypes, and selecting the best to be advanced to a final commercial variety. 
Marker-assisted (or molecular-assisted) breeding can provide a dramatic improvement in the efficiency with which breeders can select plants with desirable combinations of genes. It is used to develop both native (non-GM) trait and biotech (GM) trait products.
molecular marker is a “genetic tag” that identifies a particular location within a plant’s sequences. Plant breeders use genetic markers to identify the versions of specific genes associated with a desirable trait. This allows them to predict and guide performance at early stages of development.
Marker-assisted breeding enables the outcome of the breeding process to be optimized at the gene level, allowing for the development of plants with new properties that are beneficial to the consumer, such as improved taste, without incorporating undesirable characteristics.
Hybridization is a traditional breeding process in which two inbred lines from diverse backgrounds are crossed to create seed varieties with greater yield potential and stronger biological characteristics than exhibited by either parent – a phenomenon called hybrid vigor or heterosis.
From the farmer’s perspective, hybrid seed has many advantages, including higher yield potential, uniformity, improved plant vigor, improved resistance to stress and disease, and a better return on investment.
Crops in which breeders have achieved high levels of hybrid vigor (typically 15% or more) are dominated by hybrid varieties, which are continuously improved and adapted to current needs by the seed producer.
The introduction of hybrid seeds led to one of the biggest science-based jumps in crop productivity.
What is the problem with saving and replanting hybrid seeds?
Hybrids seeds are created through cross-fertilization of purified “inbred” lines, in which every plant has the same characteristics. Hybrid seeds are bred to improve specific attributes such as vigor. The seed produced by the second generation of the hybrid does not reliably produce a true copy of that hybrid. It will not have the same genetic make-up and characteristics as the plant from which it originated, often resulting in the loss of much of its yield potential. In addition, the practice of so-called farm-saved-seed can increase seed-borne diseases, which affect yield but also the quality of the harvest.
Read more about Farm-saved seed (FSS) practices
Biofuels are derived from biomass and offer a lower-carbon, renewable alternative to fossil fuels. 
We research and develop crops that make biofuel production more efficient and help reduce competition for land. Syngenta’s ENOGEN® , the industry’s first output trait (altering the harvested crop) in corn, accelerates the conversion of starch to sugar in ethanol production.
We focus on helping growers improve agricultural productivity and crop value to meet growing demand and reduce competition between food and fuel. 
Seed treatments are substances or physical processes applied to seeds or seedlings that help protect plants from insects and disease during critical growth stages, and improve seed quality (germination). Estimates suggest that around 80% of all plant problems are due to soil or root problems. The application of treatments to seeds promotes the development of stronger, healthier roots, leading to improved crop performance and greater resilience to conditions that may otherwise affect plant vigor. This results in improved plant health and increased yield.
Connect with usCorporate governance
China National Chemical Corporation (“ ChemChina ”), through its affiliate Saturn (NL) B.V., holds all shares of and is the sole owner of Syngenta. ChemChina is committed to respect the operational independence of and its core values as expressed in its Code of Conduct, its core policies and in its sustainability programs. The Transaction Agreement concluded between ChemChina and is underpinning this commitment by establishing a Committee of Independent Directors which is vested with important veto rights in all such areas. Accordingly, will continue to operate in a strong corporate governance framework.
The Board of Directors (Board) consists of eight non-executive Directors. The Board includes representatives with five nationalities, thereof one woman, drawn from broad international business and academic backgrounds. Its members bring diversity in expertise and perspective to the leadership of a complex, highly regulated, global business.  Read more about the current Board members .
Our Articles of Incorporation outline in detail the responsibilities of the Board based on Swiss law. Some of the Board's powers and duties are delegated to Board Committees which are: the Governance & Nomination Committee, the Compensation Committee, the Audit Committee, the Corporate Sustainability Committee, and the Committee of Independent Directors. The Board and its Committees meet on a regular basis. 
The Board has delegated the management of business operations to the Executive Team.
What is the Board of Directors' compensation?
Non-executive Directors receive an annual fee. This consists of a basic fee for services to the Board and an additional fee for individual assignments to committees of the Board. No variable compensation is paid to non-executive Directors.
The Executive Team, under the leadership of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), is responsible for the active leadership and the operative management of the company’s business. It consists of the CEO, the President Global Crop Protection and EAME, and APAC, the President Global Seeds, North America, and China, the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the Group General Counsel and the Head of Human Resources.
The compensation provided to the and the other members of the Executive Team consists of base salary and allowances, short-term and long-term incentives in cash, as well as pension, insurance and other benefits.
What is the link between the Executive Team’s performance and compensation?
For Executive Team members, all variable compensation is subject to performance measures. The short-term incentive (STI) plan rewards short-term performance. 
The financial award is based on financial targets set at the beginning of each year as part of the annual budgeting process. The personal award is based on individual priorities set at the beginning of each year as part of the performance management process. 
An payment is triggered when the financial achievement percentage of the operating unit is 86% or more. When performance is below 86% financial achievement, there is no payment. 
The payout is based on a multiplier approach that leads to significant upside opportunity in terms of outperformance and avoids over-rewarding on personal performance when does not meet the targets on financial performance.
The Long Term Incentive Plan is a three-year cash incentive plan aligning participants behind common performance measures and our shareholder’s interest. The purpose of the plan is to:
Reward leadership and outperformance by providing a cash-based incentive that links participants’ compensation to the delivery of company-wide performance measures.
Reinforce collective leadership and an enterprise mindset.
Motivate, engage and retain participants.
Under the Long-Term Incentive Plan the Board’s Compensation Committee assesses sustainability taking into account criteria such as The Good Growth Plan, freedom-to-operate and success with product-registrations. Based on the assessment, the Committee may adjust the overall achievement percentage up or down.

The includes the Head of Group Risk Management, the Head of Financial Compliance, the Head of Internal Audit, the Head of Health Safety & Environment, and other senior leaders from internal compliance functions. The Group Risk Management team is responsible for ensuring that our approach is robust and that our risk management processes are embedded across the company.
Are environmental and social aspects considered in Syngenta's risk management approach?
We include environmental and social aspects in our risk management processes. These are considered at a Group level for strategic business decisions, and are also included as part of local risk management processes. Environmental and social risks include:
Adverse weather, climate and geographical conditions as well as natural hazards
Environmental damages and liabilities
Connect with usWhat is the focus of Syngenta's R&D?
Our R&program focuses on innovation to increase yields, quality, protect plants and improve resource efficiency in the field – by developing products and practices that reduce the land, water and energy needed to grow crops.
We use our deep understanding of plants and specialist expertise in seeds, Seedcare and crop protection to develop solutions that enable farmers to grow more from less and work with them to tailor our products to better meet their needs; those solutions may be based on one technology – such as chemistry or genetics – or a combination of technologies.
Growers face challenges in three key areas:
Biotic stress from weeds, pests and diseases
Abiotic stress (or environmental pressures) such as drought, reduced nutrients and irregular temperatures
Meeting demands from customers and consumers for improved nutritional composition, consumer appeal, shelf life and processing ease
Our research groups work together to combine technologies and develop integrated solutions that address farmer needs. The direction of new research is guided by our crop teams and based on customer need, technology, regulatory requirements and socio-political trends. R&is at the heart of Syngenta's strategy and The Good Growth Plan .
Our Crop Protection research focuses on developing a range of herbicides, fungicides, insecticides and crop enhancing chemicals with broad applicability such as foliar, soil and seed treatments. Our Seeds research and development program focuses on creating new varieties of major field crops, which include improved quality and productivity. This can include greater resistance to pests and diseases, or other environmental stresses, as well as characteristics such as improved customer appeal or enhanced shelf life.
Crop Protection R&is guided by customer need, technology and regulatory requirements, and provides with innovative chemical and biological solutions. Aligning these new products with other technologies creates maximum value for our business.
Over 2,000 people work in Crop Protection R&At our major Crop Protection research centers, researchers use state-of-the-art synthetic chemistry, high-speed automated synthesis and biological methods to prepare the quantity and quality of compounds required for targeted biological screening. We use a structured design approach to chemistry that helps us develop chemical entities that have the properties most likely to relate to the desired product profile.
Once an active ingredient is ready for testing, we complete a series of trials to turn promising molecules into products that are safe to use, pass all registration requirements and meet customers' needs. The active ingredient's efficacy and safety is assessed as early as possible in the development process and all data are compiled for registration and safe product use.
We then test compounds on target crops under different climatic conditions and in varying soils around the world to develop appropriate formulations and processes to manufacture the product on a commercial scale that meats the demands from our customers.
On average, the registration of any new crop protection product takes eight to 10 years and costs around $260 million before a product is commercially launched.
Seeds R&is dedicated to creating new varieties of major crops that offer improved quality and productivity, either alone or in combination with other technologies. This includes improving tolerance to pests and other environmental stresses, as well as enhancing quality characteristics such as nutritional composition, consumer appeal and shelf life.
Over 3,000 employees work in our Seeds R&to advance the performance, stability and quality of seed varieties covering over 50 food and feed crops, including our strategic crops. We have established, and continue to develop, one of the most extensive germplasm libraries in the world and we have R&agreements and alliances with other companies and academic institutions to further extend the base of germplasm and traits we have to work from.
We develop plants with desirable characteristics using both conventional breeding (to create either inbred lines or hybrids) and biotechnology.
Conventional plant breeding involves crossing carefully chosen parent plants, then selecting the best plants from the resulting offspring to be grown on for further selection. Once the best lines have been selected, they are purified to create 'inbred' lines, in which every plant has the same characteristics, and the process of multiplying seeds begins. For many crop varieties, we produce hybrid seeds - the result of the first cross between selected parents: these seeds are unique in producing 'hybrid vigor', which leads to improved yield, performance stability and better quality.
For certain crops, also develops genetically modified (GM) plants where one or more genes of interest have been introduced to a plant via recombinant technology instead of the plant acquiring them through conventional breeding. The process involved in the development of a new biotechnology trait is very complex. It takes around 13 years from the point of discovery of a new genetic sequence, which demonstrates changes in the plant metabolism or biological activity, through to the complex registration process required by regulators. All crops are thoroughly assessed for their safety to humans, animals and the environment before receiving final regulatory approval.
We employ over 5,000 people in our research and development centers and field stations around the world. Our main global research and development sites are in: Jealott's Hill, UK; Stein, Switzerland; Research Triangle Park and Greensboro, NC, USA; Goa, India; Beijing, China; Enkhuizen, Netherlands; and Saint-Sauveur, France.
We have major Crop Protection research centers focused on identifying new active ingredients for crop protection products in Stein, Jealott's Hill and Goa. Our biotechnology activities primarily take place in Research Triangle Park for both the research and development of key native and genetically modified traits, and at the Beijing Innovation Center for early-stage evaluation of biotechnology traits. We also operate around 100 breeding and germplasm enhancement centers globally.
Are environmental and health aspects taken into account throughout the R&process?
Environmental and health aspects are considered throughout our R&processes. We undertake comprehensive assessments of both human and environmental risks throughout the research and development process. This covers risks associated with all stages of development – from concept right the way through to final use and consumption. Our human safety assessments address potential risks to users of the product and the consumers of food and feed, while our environmental safety programs seek assurance that the product will not adversely affect soil, water, air, flora or fauna.
In order for a product to receive regulatory approval for registration we must first demonstrate that it is safe for workers, the environment, the crops being protected and the people or animals eating the food created from those crops.
For crop protection products, about 30% of the cost of a new active ingredient is spent on product safety. Many of the compounds we discover are not progressed past the early development stages because they don't meet our stringent safety requirements.
For genetically modified (GM) crops, rigorous laboratory and field studies are conducted to identify and assess potential toxic, allergenic or other unintended effects that may raise safety concerns. Agricultural biotechnology products are among the most stringently tested food products available on the market.
Does profit from or contribute to external R&activities?
We complement our in-house expertise through partnerships and collaborations to bring in novel technologies and exciting new offers to growers. We currently have over 500 R&collaborations with universities, research institutes and commercial organizations around the world. These include collaborations with universities such as the Zurich, Switzerland, Wageningen University, The Netherlands, Imperial College, UK, or Queensland University of Technology, Australia; or with research institutes such as the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) and private companies such as PlantLab , Metabolon , AgBiome and Bayer CropScience .
Find out more about our collaborations on our website , on our thoughtseeders portal – our online platform that gives potential partners an easy way to share new technologies or ideas with us, as well as in our Sustainable Business Report (p. 12) .
What is biotechnology? What is a genetically modified (GM) organism?
Biotechnology is the use of living organisms to develop products with enhanced features and includes the use of genetic modification, also known as "gene technology" or "genetic engineering". This refers to the process of adding a specific gene (or genes) to an organism or removing one to produce a desirable, and often novel, characteristic. In agriculture, it allows the production of food and feed crops with improved characteristics such as higher yield, improved nutritional qualities, or resistance against insects and diseases. Biofuels may also be produced from crops.
Traditional farming practices have sought to combine crops that display useful characteristics to increase resistance to threats over an extended period of time. Since the start of crop cultivation thousands of years ago, farmers have looked for desirable traits to incorporate them into the following generation of plants. Originally they created new varieties by cross-breeding. This shuffled the plant's genes, leading to random variation, and the better plants were selected for replanting while the less interesting ones were discarded. By contrast, involves defining the desired characteristic in advance and then carefully selecting the gene that confers it. Developments in plant sciences have made it possible to identify desired 'traits' on a genetic level and to breed those desired traits safely and efficiently.
Farmers need every tool available to them to increase production using limited natural resources to meet the growing demand for food, feed, fiber and fuel as the global population rises. Biotechnology can improve productivity, secure yields and improve quality of crops, while minimizing the environmental impact of their production.
Biotechnology enables growers to achieve consistently high yields by making crops resistant to insect attacks or pathogens, or using herbicides so that weeds can be controlled more effectively. Genetically modified (GM) crops have enabled a 30% rise in corn yields in the The latest products are being developed to enable growers to respond to the effects of climate change such as drought and increasingly salty conditions.
We believe the benefits of genetic modification and other biotechnologies should be available to growers to help them grow more from less. food, feed and fuel products continue to be the most heavily tested and regulated in agriculture. We support this approach as it demonstrates that products are just as safe as conventional varieties.
Are crops safe for humans?
Yes. All genetically modified (GM) crops are subject to stringent regulations and testing of allergenic or toxic properties for humans and animals. People around the world have safely consumed foods on a daily basis for over 30 years. Leading scientific bodies, regulatory agencies and international organizations have concluded that crops are as safe as similar crops developed using more conventional breeding methods.
No. Food allergies are a concern for many people. Approximately 90% of food-related allergies are caused by proteins found in a range of common foods: tree nuts, peanuts, soybeans, milk, eggs, fish, crustaceans and wheat1. crops are always screened for potential allergens as part of the regulatory approval process. Also, biotechnology is now being used to modify or remove existing allergens from certain foods.

Are crops safe for the environment?
Biotechnology delivers biodiversity benefits in numerous ways because of their proven record of environmental safety. By building in an ability to fight particular pests, insect-resistant genetically modified (GM) crops avoid the need for pesticides with minimal impacts on non-target species. Bt corn, for example, uses protein derived from the soil micro-organism Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), also used as a pesticide in organic farming. Bt proteins target specific pests and degrade rapidly so they have a low impact on the broader environment. 
There is no credible evidence that existing crops are or could be any more difficult to manage in the farm environment than conventionally-bred crops, for example, by becoming weeds. Both conventionally-bred and crops are developed to have certain traits that are beneficial for agricultural purposes.1
Do crops increase the use of pesticides?
Genetically modified (GM) crops do not increase the use of pesticides under good management practices. Some cases show the opposite: crops that can resist disease or pests do not require treatment. Cotton, for example, traditionally requires spraying to control pests inside the cotton ball, but the development of insect resistant cotton has greatly reduced the use of pesticides.
Do crops compromise other types of food production?
Good agricultural practices – that farmers have often been using for many years – help minimize mixing of crops and enable the various agricultural production systems to coexist in a particular country or region. These include separation of crops by space and time, communicating with neighbors, use of good husbandry, planting, harvest and storage practices.
How much revenue does generate from products?
We sell genetically modified (GM) seeds for corn and soybean crops.
The percentage of our total revenues generated from was just under 10% in the past 3 years, representing about 40% of our global seeds sales. Countries where our seed is cultivated include Argentina, Brazil, Canada, the Philippines, Vietnam and the US.
What is Syngenta's position on labeling of products?
We adhere to all local legislation regarding labeling of genetically modified (GM) products and we support the use of accurate and informative product labeling. All our seed bags are labeled to allow traceability throughout the supply chain, and we work closely with our suppliers and regulators to make sure that the information we provide is meaningful to the customer, enabling them to choose which products they want to use.
We believe that consumers should be well informed about the types of foods available – providing choices about the food they buy. Labeling of produce enables this choice, but is not a safety issue, since products are subject to extensive safety assessments. Our view is that governments wishing to implement labeling in the interests of consumer choice must display the importance of providing consumer information with the associated costs and practicalities.
Does have an Environmental Management System in place and is it certified?
We have a Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) management system that covers our global operations. It is tailored to our business, but is comparable with other recognized management systems. We believe it is more comprehensive than current ISO, and systems. We go beyond standard industry models with the inclusion of much more demanding risk management and reporting requirements. Where there is a local requirement to do so we have secured certification in order to meet specific customer requirements.
All of our sites are required to undergo an annual review of their management system to ensure its continued effectiveness.
What is Syngenta's commitment to environmental protection?
Our commitment to environmental protection is clearly set out in our Code of Conduct and Policy and Standards . As a leading global company committed to sustainable agriculture, we have a responsibility to protect the environment. Our industry leading commitment to environmental performance plays a key part in developing and protecting our reputation with all our stakeholders.
Our Environmental Codes of Practice establish minimum requirements that must be followed to reduce potential soil, surface water and groundwater contamination. We believe that good environmental management is everyone's responsibility. Our leaders are expected to champion our standards and encourage every employee in every location to take personal responsibility for reducing our environmental impacts.
Local environmental laws and regulations, and the way in which they are enforced, vary greatly around the world. We treat all local requirements as the minimum standard and often go much further as part of our consistent approach to compliance across our business.
We maintain Health, Safety and Environmental (HSE) management systems across all our sites to ensure compliance with our own standards and external regulations. Each site measures and monitors its environmental impacts. Unplanned releases from our chemical manufacturing activities are a particular concern and we allocate significant resources to prevent such incidents. We report our environmental compliance in our Sustainable Business Report (p. 43) .
also produces an annual Letter of Assurance, which covers a review of risks, local performance, compliance with legal requirements and Policy and Standards, and progress against improvement plans. This method ensures that local managers take personal accountability for the management of risks and all compliance issues.
Compliance and risk management is integrated and reviewed in all functions of as part of operational management and governance. Risk and compliance issues are addressed, and escalated, if necessary, to the Executive Team and Board-level Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC) review twice a year.
Syngenta's own active substances that meet the requirements of Article 15.1 are considered exempt from regulations. However, we manufacture and import raw materials, intermediates and co-formulants that are covered by REACH.
We monitor and other environmental regulations globally to ensure we comply with requirements. We successfully met the requirements of the first two phases of on target in 2010 and 2013, and have integrated the requirements into our existing operations. We are on-track to meet the final phase deadline in 2018 and we have processes in place to ensure any relevant new raw materials, intermediates or co-formulants attain registration.
number of our sites have been selected for audit by authorities as part of the program so far and all have achieved successful outcomes.
Robust reporting processes enable us to understand, monitor and report performance over time. We monitor and report annually the following key performance indicators: energy efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions, other air emissions, water use, wastewater, and waste. We report our environmental impact in absolute terms and normalized against sales to measure intensity as our business grows.
An external auditor is appointed annually to assure the Corporate Responsibility data – including environmental data - published in our Annual Report. This is completed in compliance with the International Standard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000.
Pwhas conducted the external assurance of our corporate responsibility reporting since 2004. Find out more about PwC's Independent Assurance Report in our Sustainable Business Report (p. 45) .
How does reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in its operations and suppliers?
Our environmental management system monitors our performance in energy efficiency and carbon emissions at our sites and helps us identify opportunities to reduce our impacts. Our sites have energy efficiency programs, which are continuous and permanent: upon achieving their targets, the sites will start striving for accomplishing even stricter programs.
We have a long tradition of assessing our chemical suppliers’ compliance with our health, safety and quality standards. In 2015, we joined the chemical industry’s Together for Sustainability (TfS) initiative, which pools the resources of its member companies to optimize the efficiency of supplier audits. These include evaluation of suppliers’ action to track and reduce emissions.
We are also committed to the reduction of CO2 emissions for all our land, sea and air distribution logistics.
Does have any environmental liabilities connected to its operations?
number of our sites inherited environmental liabilities from legacy companies, including issues relating to old or current production, accident and landfill sites. We take these legacy issues very seriously. We participate in project organizations adopting a risk-based approach to secure, monitor or clean-up these sites. We apply our high standards of environmental management and protection to these sites. 
Connect with usWhat is Syngenta's supply chain management approach?
We strive for an end-to-end integrated approach to designing and operating our supply chains that combines our own internal manufacturing network with an extensive supplier base to ensure our supply chain objectives match our commercial product strategies. The products and services we procure from suppliers are divided into two categories:
Direct - the supply of all materials that are required in the manufacture or supply of the products we sell
Indirect – the goods and services that are required to support our operations (including professional services, information systems, marketing, engineering, waste and utilities)
Clear policies define the principles that guide all our procurement activities around the world. Our objectives are to ensure that goods and services are acquired under the best conditions to support our business and that our high standards on corporate responsibility are met. We ensure that our suppliers, and employees engaging with suppliers, understand the high standards we expect on issues such as labor practices, business ethics, health, safety and environment as set out in our Code of Conduct .
We monitor our suppliers' performance through audits and assessments to ensure compliance with our standards and identify opportunities for improvement. As a member of the Together for Sustainability Initiative , we have partnered with others within the chemical industry to try to do this in the most efficient way for suppliers. Employees engaging with suppliers undergo training on ethical procurement practices as well as specific training on topics such as fraud awareness.
Our aim is for to be the customer of choice for our key suppliers. We use our assessment processes and regular, open dialogue with suppliers to help us develop strong positive relationships in the market place.
Our supplier relationship management (SRM) approach enables us to manage suppliers effectively, promoting strong governance practices, while enabling us to focus on our most critical suppliers to maximize value and reduce risks in our supply chain.
The approach encompasses a clear strategy and process, defined supplier segmentation, clear roles and accountabilities, effective tools and resources, and a commitment to continuous improvement from and our suppliers. It enables us to identify our most important suppliers from a supply chain that includes more than 1,000 global tier 1 suppliers for active ingredients, raw materials, intermediates and co-formulants.
The process begins with an analysis of our supplier base using filters such as spend, business impact, and single source situations. To segment and identify key suppliers each organization is then rated on a number of criteria such as technical fit, operational fit, location, sustainability (environmental, social, ethical) and quality standards, financial health of the organization, strategic alignment with our business, trust, and people retention and management.
We establish continuous improvement plans and risk management dashboards for all key suppliers, as well as providing additional management support where appropriate, such as assignment of supplier leads and key account managers. Additional support for suppliers can include awareness training or upstream sourcing assistance.
benefits from strong relationships with key suppliers and we often strive to form strategic partnerships with suppliers for multiple sourcing projects.
How does manage risk in its supply chain?
We use a number of tools to manage risks in the various tiers of our supply chain. These instruments allow us to assess risks associated with individual suppliers and with the sourcing of individual products. view of the risks per supply chain is considered in some detail in order that appropriate mitigation actions can be put into place.
Does consider environmental and social aspects in its supply chain management approach?
Choosing responsible partners to work with is part of our commitment to be a responsible business. We set global requirements for suppliers on health, safety, environment, labor and human rights, and we carry out rigorous assessments and audits to monitor compliance and drive improvement.
We expect our suppliers to uphold the standards set out in our Code of Conduct . This sets out clear expectations on environmental and social requirements. Our procurement policies ensure that these principles are put into practice across our supplier base. Suppliers are required to achieve compliance either by demonstrating that they have a binding document in place comparable to the Code of Conduct or by making our Code of Conduct part of the contractual agreement.
Read our Sustainable Business Report (p. 26) and (p. 32) to find out more about managing corporate responsibility in our supply chain.
Is the environment and social performance of suppliers assessed?
We have a long tradition of assessing suppliers’ environmental and social performance and working with them to improve standards.
In 2015, we joined the Together for Sustainability (TfS) initiative. The Tfmembers work jointly on supplier audits and assessments on health, safety and the environment, as well as social and ethical issues. The Tfframework supports the principles of the Global Compact, responsible Care and the International Labor Organization. By auditing together, Tfenables us to focus on raising standards for our suppliers with greater efficiency.
We also conduct additional, more in depth audits focused on health, safety and environment (HSE) at selected chemical suppliers and formulation, fill and packaging suppliers. Sites are selected for audits based on a number of criteria - including the strategic importance and any likely risks associated with that site. Suppliers are rated on their performance and receive recommendations detailing any areas for improvement. We only work with a supplier once a minimum standard is achieved, and failure to make improvements can lead to the cancellation of any contractual arrangements.
In China and in India, we have launched our Process Safety Management Program. It involves training and auditing of key chemical suppliers handling high hazard products or processes, with a focus on driving their capability improvement in this critical area.
Audits are also completed at warehouse and logistics service providers. These sites are selected based on record, hazard of materials to be stored or transported, and their importance to our business. The audits are carried out by an independent, competent professional against the standards defined in Syngenta's codes of practice. Gaps are identified and if required an action plan is put in place.
We also monitor our seed supply farms to ensure compliance with labor standards (see the questions below for more detail).
Read more about our supplier programs in our Sustainable Operations page and in our Sustainable Business Report (p.31)
tests physiological, purity, and seed health aspects relevant to the crop and legal requirements. The rules of the International Seed Testing Association (ISTA) and the rules of the Association of Official Seed Analysts (AOSA) for North America are the general guidelines for physiological testing. For seed health the appropriate standards are the National Seed Health System (NSHS; USA), (European accreditation body) and the standards of the International Seed Health Initiative (ISHI).
Where a country of sale has no specific requirements, adheres to internal test protocols as a minimum standard. These protocols are defined in our Quality Management System that covers all activities to direct, control and coordinate quality standards. The rules set forth are translated into our work instructions and procedures for testing and ensuring seed quality. The quality of our products gives confidence to our customers, builds reputation and enables our business growth.
The Code of Conduct sets out our commitment to build and maintain trust in and to integrate our business, social and environmental responsibilities into everything we do. We expect our seed suppliers to live up to the same standards we set ourselves. In The Good Growth Plan , we have committed to look after every worker by striving for fair labor conditions throughout our entire supply chain network by 2020.
The Fair Labor Program helps to further strengthening our relationship with our seed growing partners. The program promotes decent working conditions related to health and safety, child labor, employment relationship, compensation, working hours, freedom of association and collective bargaining, harassment and abuse, forced labor and nondiscrimination. The program is well established in Asia Pacific and Latin America, and was recently rolled out in various European countries. We currently cover about 80% of our total seed supply network and plan to expand it further.
We work with the Fair Labor Association (FLA), which provides independent assurance that the processes associated with our Fair Labor Program are robust and comply with their standards of fair labor and responsible sourcing. To provide this assurance, representatives visit farms, review documentation and interview workers. Each visit lasts approximately three days and is undertaken during peak production periods when the risk of non-compliance is greatest.
What is Syngenta's approach to customer relationship management?
We put the grower at the heart of everything we do. We look at business decisions and processes through their eyes, enabling us to respond to the needs of our customers. Our approach to Customer Relationship Management (CRM) is established globally and delivered locally within each country by our commercial teams – this provides consistency for our customers and ensures our vision is translated effectively into all of our customer interactions.
There are a number of key considerations that steer our activities – all are focused on identifying customer needs and adding value through the products and services we provide. We look at what the market requires and, in particular, what growers and their customers need and demand. We strive to find innovative ways to engage with customers to respond quickly with information and robust solutions.
Customer satisfaction is important to us and we gather feedback directly from customers in all regions where we operate. We monitor a number of different metrics but focus on overall satisfaction at regional or country level to understand how well our products and services are received.
We provide a wide variety of information to our customers. Our products often differ by country and we adapt our approach to respond to local needs and requirements. Country websites provide extensive product information including our Material Safety Data Sheets (see and examples). Through their daily interactions with customers, our sales teams also provide product information and advice on benefits and safe use and can learn about the challenges they are facing. We also have call centers to provide our customers with easy, toll-free access to comprehensive advice about our entire product range.
We make it a priority to create an environment where employees feel secure, have peace of mind and can perform at their best. Security risks include risks to the security of our people, assets, products, and information. We manage these risks through:
People protection – we take steps to protect employees by advising them of significant security risks when they are working or traveling, particularly in high-risk countries.
Product security – we protect our products by enhancing confidence in them and taking action against infringers, so as to sustain our market share and brand reputation.
Asset protection – we protect Syngenta's physical assets and critical third party locations against internal and external threats such as burglary, robbery, theft, and sabotage.
Information security – we regard information as a key corporate asset that must be protected against theft, misuse, leakage and loss, in accordance with relevant laws and regulations.
Our Security Policy defines the basic principles of Syngenta's approach to security. It sets out our expectations for the company and defines what managers and employees need to do to meet them. Our aim is to minimize internal and external security risks associated with all company activities, from product invention to delivery and beyond.
number of detailed Security Code of Practice documents support the policy. Through these we provide further detail on specific security requirements for our people, assets, products and information.
We comply with laws and regulations and seek to fully consider security in all activities through effective risk management. Our aim is to create a security-conscious culture in which all employees take personal responsibility for preventing security incidents. We rigorously and ethically investigate all security incidents.
Our security practices are developed and implemented using an approach based on intelligence and risk assessment. We make security a key consideration in our everyday work to help us manage continually changing risks.
As a global organization, we are exposed to a significant and complex range of potential risks – from cybercrime to conflicts arising from political instability. We aim to proactively assess, identify and address emerging security risks before they become an issue.
Our security processes focus on sites with potential risk exposures for people, products, assets and/or information. These sites include production, R&or commercial facilities, and are evaluated to determine the level of security risk and any mitigation measures needed. Our security processes also extend to third-party supplier sites and warehouses.
We have set clear responsibilities for employees, managers and security professionals. Employees must act responsibly to minimize security risks to our people, assets, products and information. Managers are accountable for the security in their area of responsibility and are expected to lead by example. Our team of security professionals define, maintain, deploy, support and monitor security practices at both corporate and local levels.
Under our Security 360° program, we undertake security assessments across strategically important sites. We monitor the results of these assessments and publish performance annually through our Annual Report. If required, Security Improvement Action Plans are developed. The implementation of these plans is then monitored and reported internally through a defined process to mitigate the identified risks.
Counterfeiting of our products can be hazardous to users, the public and the environment. We track and externally report the number of product security cases and the tonnes of suspect crop protection and seed product seized by authorities.
The majority of our security personnel are unarmed – in accordance with the identified level of risk. However, we maintain armed security personnel in a small number of sites globally where security risks have been identified as particularly high due to frequent instances of violent crime or terrorism, or where this is legally required. Our primary focus is always the safety of our people. The arming of security officers follows well-defined rules, governed by a Corporate Security Code of Practice written in line with recognized best practice in the field of security management and human rights, and in accordance with local law.
Our Corporate Security teams have been trained on potential human rights concerns and best practices related to security management and key international human rights codes – including international humanitarian laws, the International Code of Conduct for Private Security Providers and the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights.
We employ third party security service providers at around 160 of our sites. All of them have to meet our requirements on human rights, and all new contracts include a requirement to operate in accordance with the International Code of Conduct for Private Security Providers, to which many of our contractors are already signatories.
We conduct risk assessments at all sites employing armed security officers to confirm whether carrying of arms is appropriate.
Has signed up to the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights?
Membership of the Voluntary Principles Initiative is restricted to the extractive sector – including oil, gas and mining. Although companies in our sector are unable to sign-up to this, we use the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights as an important reference document. It is used by Security Management to help ensure that third party security services act in accordance with best practice.
What is Syngenta’s position on the occurrences at its former R&site in Cascavel?
In 2007, a former R&site in Cascavel (Brazil) was illegally occupied by several hundred protesters. confrontation occurred when a number of guards employed by the security company returned to the site without Syngenta’s authorization several hours after the illegal occupation began, tragically resulting in the fatalities of a guard and a protester.
We are saddened by the incident and condemn the use of violence. is not responsible for the confrontation which occurred at the site or the ensuing events and was absolved of any criminal liability in the police investigation and action by the public prosecutor which followed the events. We are in fundamental disagreement with the decision by the 1st Civil Court of Cascavel within the Civil Lawsuit filed against as the company cannot be liable based on the alleged facts. We have appealed this decision.
Connect with usWhat is Syngenta's purpose?
Our purpose is Bringing plant potential to life and we’re a leading agriculture company helping to improve global food security by enabling millions of farmers to make better use of available resources. Through world class science and innovative crop solutions, our 28,000 people in over 90 countries are working to transform how crops are grown. We are committed to rescuing land from degradation, enhancing biodiversity and revitalizing rural communities.
Our overarching ambition is simple – we want to help farmers and growers around the world grow more from less. We use our world-class science to transform the way crops are grown to improve yields in a sustainable way. In doing so, we will contribute to bringing greater food security and meeting the needs of a global population that is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, and help to overcome increasing pressure on limited resources such as land, water and energy.
We want to create a worldwide step-change in agricultural productivity. Each farm and farmer has a role to play – not just the 8 million large farmers managing over 100 hectares, but the 450 million smallholders. This means embracing innovation and exploring ways to engage new customers in emerging markets.
"The Good Growth Plan" reflects Syngenta's belief that agricultural productivity must increase in order to feed a global population which is currently increasing by 200,000 every day. At the same time, farmland is being depleted through urbanization and soil erosion while water resources are under increasing pressure. Rural communities – those responsible for growing food – are often trapped in poverty.
The Good Growth Plan includes specific commitments to address these critical challenges. By 2020, we commit to:
Make crops more efficient – Increase average productivity of the world's major crops by 20 percent without using more land, water or inputs
Rescue more farmland – Improve the fertility of 10 million hectares of farmland on the brink of degradation
Empower smallholders – Reach 20 million smallholders and enable them to increase productivity by 50 percent
Help people stay safe – Train 20 million farm workers on labor safety, especially in developing countries
Look after every worker – Strive for fair labor conditions throughout our entire supply chain network
Our intention is to make a deep, lasting and positive impact on the farmers and rural communities who provide the world's food security and the long-term sustainability of our planet.
Is contributing to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)?
Syngenta, along with the industry, has been contributing to the sustainable intensification of agriculture around the world for many years. We welcome and support the call for intensified, cross-sectorial multi-stakeholder collaboration made through the SDGs in order to achieve progress. Private sector initiatives and partnerships play a crucial role in achieving many of the targets set in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development . In a world where a growing population needs more food and where preserving natural resources is a basic requirement, agricultural technology can have a substantial and measurable impact.
In 2013, launched The Good Growth Plan , an ambitious program that reflects many goals included in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. has committed to help grow more food using fewer resources, while protecting nature and helping people in rural communities live better lives. Our company aims to make a deep, lasting and positive impact on the world’s food security and the planet’s long-term sustainability. Through the six commitments set out in The Good Growth Plan and the progress made so far, demonstrates active support for many of the SDGs, especially in the field of how to sustainably grow crops, reduce hunger, alleviate poverty, conserve biodiversity and restore degraded land.
We undertake regular materiality assessments to help us define the priority issues for our business and our stakeholders. These assessments incorporate an analysis of stakeholder concerns and expectations and the issues that we believe present the greatest risks and opportunities for our business. We use the results to drive our strategy, determine allocation of resources and guide our communication.
We engage with and collect feedback from stakeholders in a variety of ways. We hear from the grower community through satisfaction surveys and farmers' direct contact with our sales teams on the ground. We also engage directly with our employees and locally with the communities close to our operations. Our interaction with industry associations (e.g. CropLife ), non-governmental organizations, international organizations (e.g. , ), and governments enables us to gather feedback on our activities and monitor issues important to stakeholders. We also consider environmental and social aspects in our Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) assessments.
In 2013, we commissioned a global research study involving over 7,500 people in 13 countries to assess their perceptions on the topic of food security and the challenges of agriculture. The Agricultural Disconnect study concluded that producing more food for a growing population in an environmentally sustainable way will be one of the next decade's most important global challenges. However, there are conflicting opinions about how best to address this challenge, and about the likely impact of increased production on the environment and on the people who grow the food and work on the farms.
Our materiality matrix sets out the most important  issues for and our stakeholders. The most important issue to our  stakeholders is our contribution to food security. In particular, they want to  know how our technologies and products will enable growers to deliver  sustainably the quality and quantity of food needed by a growing population. We  contribute to addressing these issues through The Good Growth Plan.
Connect with usHow does the company define smallholder farmers?
Worldwide, there are around 450 million smallholder farmers. We define smallholders as growers who face significant challenges in production and market access due to their limited land area or lack of infrastructure. They are generally dependent on their own and family labor. While this typically means growers with less than two hectares, each country and crop has its own particular dynamics and so we do not use a rigid global definition based on farm size.
In The Good Growth Plan , we have committed to empower smallholders by reaching 20 million small farmers and enabling them to increase their productivity by 50 percent by 2020.
Smallholders are vitally important to addressing and achieving global food security. They constitute almost half the hungry people in the world even though they currently produce around 25% of global food and feed more than 2 billion people. We estimate that by 2050, even if large farmers can increase their production by 20%, smallholders will still need to more than double their production to feed the world.
Our experience has shown that an ongoing engagement with smallholder farmers on-the ground is needed to help them increasing productivity and profitability in a sustainable way. In The Good Growth Plan , we have committed to empower smallholders by reaching 20 million smallholders and enabling them to increase productivity by 50 percent by 2020. Smallholder farmers are an integral part of Syngenta’s customer base in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Half our sales come from emerging markets where smallholders dominate the farming market (80% and 95% respectively).
The Good Growth Plan is the enabling platform for many initiatives and projects that we have initiated and that we are supporting to improve the livelihoods of smallholder farmers across the world. Wherever we operate, we seek to make a positive contribution, as outlined in our Code of Conduct .
Women are often the backbone of rural economies around the world. Globally, they represent two-thirds of smallholders and 60 percent of all farmers. Research has shown that when women do have access to relevant services and other inputs, such as improved seeds and fertilizers, they will increase their yields substantially.
From the data gathered three years into  The Good Growth Plan , we have learned that there is more to be done to address women better, and we are now taking a step towards exploring this opportunity. We have a significant number of women among our existing and potential customers and we understand that there are opportunities to tailor our outreach programs to serve them more effectively.
Are there initiatives developed by and its partners that focus on improving smallholders' livelihoods?
There are more than 450 million smallholder farmers around the world who grow approximately 25% of global food. They economically support more than 2 billion people. However, the farm productivity is relatively low in these markets, and is working to increase the productivity of more than 20 million smallholders by 50% by 2020. This is a key element of The Good Growth Plan .
In markets around the world, develops and sells solutions that enable smallholder farmers to improve their productivity and profitability. Our solutions are tailored by crops and geographies. In Asia for example, our GroMoreprogram looks at rice growing through a paddy farmer's eyes. It provides growers with the right knowledge and technology in each key development phase of the crop (seedling - vegetative - reproductive - ripening). The knowledge is transferred to smallholders through farmer meetings, field days and other training platforms.
Along with better agronomy, trainings on the safe use of crop protection products, the cascading of know-how and technologies through self-help farmer organizations, and as a result of strategic partnerships, our solutions may include improved access to finance and provide better access to market.
Read more about Syngenta’s participation in public private partnerships under the World Economic Forum's New Vision for Agriculture , including the Southern Agriculture Growth Corridor in Tanzania, Grow Africa, and Grow Asia (Vietnam, Indonesia). Additionally, works together with public and private food chain partners in various smallholders' initiatives in several key countries (Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Nicaragua; Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Vietnam; Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Senegal).
Improving smallholders' access to technology
How does contribute to agricultural education programs or institutions to improve capacity building amongst farmers – and smallholders in particular?
Specific initiatives demonstrate how we help farmers in all parts of the world to better protect their crops and seeds. We accompany our solutions with capacity building initiatives for our customers that range from the dissemination of good agronomy, training in the safe, efficient and responsible use of agrochemicals, to biodiversity protection measures and advice on how to improve access to markets.
We entered into partnerships with other organizations including academia, NGOs, industry associations, local organizations and product retailers, to scale up the initiatives and programs to support their agronomy programs. To this end, the company and its partners run trainings in agronomy and in the safe and responsible use of crop protection products.
How does market commercial varieties and other inputs that are appropriate to the needs of smallholders?
We focus on building and sharing knowledge by providing smallholders good agronomy practices, combined with safe use and environmental stewardship. We set up demonstration farms where growers can experience first-hand the solutions we are tailoring to meet the local needs.
Through our Lead Farmer Networks we can reach a greater number of smallholders within the same community. We support Lead Farmers through education programs on best practices on the farm. Thereafter, these Lead Farmers will disseminate the knowledge by demonstrating the solutions and providing advice to their neighbors.
We are also exploring different options for connecting with smallholders via digital platforms. Technology can help us to provide timely agronomic advice to more smallholder farmers and help enable better access for them to information, markets and finance. We are currently piloting this approach across a number of geographies.
How does the company leverage its strengths to increase access to seeds and other inputs for smallholder farmers?
Syngenta’s presence in over 90 countries brings us close to smallholder famers in any part of the world. We reach out to them via distribution channels, our sales force and through specifically designed projects. In The Good Growth Plan we have committed to reaching 20 million smallholder farmers by 2020 and enable them to increase productivity by 50%. Read more about our progress .
Smallholder farmers need skills and resources to prosper. To increase productivity and profitability in a sustainable way, we offer training on agronomic practices, and provide advice on appropriate products and technology and how to use these effectively. By equipping smallholders with appropriate solutions and expertise, we help them develop their farming practices to ensure increased food security for themselves and their communities.
Solutions that are specifically designed for smallholders range from: producing smaller, more affordable packs of products in Asia and Africa to establishing demonstration farms, Centers of Excellence and Learning Centers. We are developing solutions to help farmers gain access to market, finance and insurance, and we are offering bartering models. Furthermore, in a number of countries we are using a lead farmer model to disseminate best practices from a community’s lead farmer to the smallholders he is surrounded by. We are replicating this model and rolling it out across different smallholder environments in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
What programs has in place to make seeds and inputs more affordable to smallholder farmers?
tailors its solutions to the needs of its customers. Initiatives such as develop and promote the introduction of small packages to help smallholder farmers get access to high quality seeds and crop protection products. While we pay particular attention to local languages, the use of pictograms helps overcome language and illiteracy issues and ensure growers understand how to safely use, store and dispose the product. Furthermore, the sachets are designed to withstand humidity changes. Read more about what does to make sure its products are used safely
In The Good Growth Plan , we have committed to empower smallholders by reaching 20 million smallholders and enabling them to increase productivity by 50 percent by 2020. Increasing productivity is an important first step to raise smallholders above a subsistence level.
We want to understand what impact our products and services have on smallholder livelihoods. In numerous countries with smallholder customers, we have launched a series of independent Social Impact Assessments conducted by , Solidaridad and Market Probe . These assessments help us to understand e.g. whether our smallholder customers (compared to smallholders with similar growing conditions but who hardly use technology or attend trainings) have more income, whether their Progress Out Of Poverty Index is higher, whether they practice better soil and biodiversity management, and whether they know how to safely use crop protection products.
Social Impact Assessments depict a given social, economic and environmental situation. They also provide in-depth insights into how we can continuously improve our agronomic, environmental and safe-use trainings to enable smallholder farmers to achieve higher yields and better performance.
Does participate in the 'Access to Seeds' index?
The Access to Seeds Index is published every two years by the Access to Seeds Foundation, with the support of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs. The Index compares the efforts of seed companies to enhance the productivity of smallholder farmers.
is part of the Access to Seeds Index. The index recognized the high level of transparency about how engages with smallholder farmers across the world. With the launch of The Good Growth Plan, has committed to reach 20 million smallholder farmers and enable them to increase productivity by 50 percent by 2020. The Good Growth Plan is an integral part of our strategy and we report on progress regularly on our website .
Our Code of Conduct is a key part of our compliance framework. It demonstrates our commitment to build and maintain trust in and to integrate business, social and environmental responsibilities in everything we do.
The revised Code of Conduct was launched in 2009. It was developed in consultation with leading business ethics and human rights organizations such as the Institute for Business Ethics, the International Business Leaders Forum, and the Danish Institute for Human Rights.
The Code covers the following key topics: law, business integrity, society, people and science, products, and property rights.
Who has to comply with the Code of Conduct?
Everyone working for must adhere to our Code of Conduct .
The same standards of ethics and integrity apply to third parties working for or on behalf of Syngenta. Our Compliance guide for third parties sets out the minimum standards expected of third parties when working with Syngenta.
What other corporate codes of practice does have?
The Code of Conduct sets out clearly the standards different stakeholders can expect from on a range of relevant and important issues. The Code is supported by detailed policies, standards and guidelines such as:
Anti-Bribery Policy – establishes our approach to engaging in ethical business negotiations across all levels of our organization
Securities Trading Policy – defines the rules and procedures associated with trading while in possession of material information that is not publicly available
Gifts and Entertainment Policy – provides clear guidance to our people on their responsibilities regarding corporate gifts and entertainment
Competition Law Policy – defines the principles of antitrust and competition law and establishes our expectations for ensuring these principles are upheld
Policy and Standards – set out the standards of Health, Safety and Environment (HSE) expected throughout Syngenta, and outlines what needs to be done to achieve them
All of our policies are binding for employees and external contractors and stakeholders who engage with Syngenta.
How does implement the Code of Conduct and ensure compliance?
Everyone at is expected to know, understand and apply our Code of Conduct without exception. . All employees receive a copy of the Code and we offer discussion sessions with leaders and online training to help employees deepen their understanding. The Code is also embedded into our daily employee interactions – managers must ensure that employees understand the Code, providing training and support as required.
We expect every employee to take personal accountability for upholding the Code and suppliers are required to demonstrate compliance through their own policies or through contractual obligations to uphold the Code.
Compliance with the Code is the accountability of territory, regional and functional leadership teams to ensure a holistic review of compliance and risks in Syngenta.
We also have a Head of Group Compliance at global level and a team of regional compliance officers who are responsible for developing, implementing and monitoring our corporate compliance framework and implementation tools. The compliance officers work directly with managers around the world to ensure consistent implementation of the Code as well as other policies and guidelines.
We encourage and expect employees to report any suspected breaches of the Code of Conduct and we take all reports of potential violations seriously.
How can suspected violations of the Code of Conduct be reported?
Employees are encouraged to report any breach or suspected breach, of the Code of Conduct to their line manager, a compliance officer or local HR/Legal/Finance teams or through our confidential compliance helpline. This helpline is accessible on our website and can also be used by our suppliers and contractors.
The helpline is available 24-hours a day and in several languages. Reports can also be made online via our intranet. We take every concern seriously and investigate each one in line with our policies. We do not tolerate any form of retaliation against an employee who has reported a suspected compliance violation in good faith, nor will we tolerate any deliberately abusive accusations.
We publish the number of concerns reported through our compliance helpline annually as well as the number of leaders engaged in leader-led compliance sessions. In these sessions managers discuss with their teams relevant compliance topics and encourage people to speak up if they have concerns.
may engage in political debate on subjects that advance the company's goals and improve the communities where we work and live.
We maintain strict internal control of lobbying activities and conduct them in full compliance with local law and guided by honesty, completeness, respect, accuracy of information and transparency.
Any lobbying activities carried out by appointed external agencies or through our industry associations must be guided by the same principles that apply for Syngenta.
At Syngenta, we are committed to conducting business with the highest standards of integrity and responsibility, and to preventing any form of public and private bribery in our organization. Our Code of Conduct and our Anti-Bribery Policy demonstrate our commitment to corporate responsibility, help to foster an ethical company culture, and build confidence among our external stakeholders in the way we do business.
Our Code of Conduct sets out our commitment to comply with all labor laws, national and international codes and conventions, and to uphold the principles set out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization’s (ILO) Core Conventions. is a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact , endorsing the 10 universal principles covering human rights, labor, the environment and anti-corruption.
is a member of the Global Business Initiative on Human Rights --  a coalition of companies working together to develop good practices and sharing experiences as well as outreach  in line with the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights . We also work with the Institute for Human Rights and Business , which is a global center of excellence and expertise on the relationship between business and human rights.
Our Code of Conduct, which employees, contractors and suppliers must adhere to, ensures that everyone working for respects human rights. It was developed in consultation with the Institute for Business Ethics and the International Business Leaders Forum and informed by a risk analysis conducted by the Danish Institute for Human Rights. The results of the risk analysis led to the development of policies covering a number of labor, product, community and security issues.
promotes employee empowerment and human rights protection and seeks dialogue with our employees and their representatives (Works Councils, Labor Unions) based on our labor standards .
Our minimum requirements on labor and human rights are integrated in all supplier contracts and we work with the Fair Labor Association (FLA) to monitor and improve labor standards on seed farms around the world which are part of our supply chain. assessments cover issues such as child labor, health and safety, and workers' rights.  Visit our Good Growth Plan commitment to find out more about how we look after every worker and report on progress .
As a member of the Global Business Initiative on Human Rights , we are working with other companies and organizations to ensure our approach remains current and understand how best to implement the Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.
Our business also has an important contribution to make to support human rights through the role of our products in improving food security, access to water, farmers’ livelihoods and rural development.
How does look after those who produce our products?
As part of The Good Growth Plan , we have committed to strive for fair labor conditions throughout our entire supply chain network. Every year we contract with thousands of seed growers across over 30 countries to produce our seeds. The complexity of this supply chain poses particular challenges. 
Since 2004, we have worked with the Fair Labor Association  to set up supplier labor codes, training programs, and monitoring protocols etc. for our seed supply farms. The program was initially rolled-out in a number of key countries where labor rights were identified to be at high-risk either due to local labor regulations, labor market situation, or local farming practices. 
In our flowers business we are rolling-out the and (social practice standard) certifications on all our own and third party flower production sites across all regions.
We have been auditing chemical suppliers’ compliance with health, safety, quality and labor standards for many years. Having analyzed the sustainability risk for each supplier, we are working to bring all those in material risk categories into our Supplier Sustainability Program. In 2015, we joined the Together for Sustainability initiative (TfS) . This brings together international chemical companies to share joint supplier audits on health, safety, environmental, social and ethical issues in line with the principles of the United Nations Global Compact , Responsible Care® and the International Labor Organization . This enables us to reach deeper into our supply chain and to raise the bar for suppliers. It will also free up resources so that we can conduct `deep dive´ assessments of our strategically most important suppliers.
We use animal studies only when necessary and aim to develop alternative techniques that replace and reduce the use of animals. However, in many countries, legislation requires animal testing to ensure products are safe to humans and the environment. We have no laboratories that undertake animal studies, but we do sub-contract such work. We only use contract laboratories that meet the highest standards for animal care, and we audit them to ensure these standards are consistently applied.
How is animal testing governed and managed at Syngenta?
The "Animal Welfare Policy" sets standards that apply to animal studies carried out by third party contractors on behalf of Syngenta. The Animal Ethical Review Committee (SAERC) is responsible for ensuring compliance with this policy and mandated legal and regulatory requirements.
We also require that managers initiating animal work sign an annual Letter of Assurance that the Policy and Commitments have been complied with in the facilities performing the studies. This letter provides an assurance that both the facilities used and the study protocols are compliant.
We expect our contract laboratories to have management systems in place that are consistent with our Policy and Commitments to the care and use of animals in research and development.
We expect our contract laboratories to have management systems in place that are consistent with our policies and commitment to the care and use of animals in research and development. We conduct audits of third parties to monitor compliance. We report on the number of management system audits conducted on our Sustainable Business Report (p. 44) .
Connect with usHow does engage with stakeholders?
We engage with stakeholders on a variety of issues to help us shape our understanding of the corporate responsibility issues we must address every day. We communicate with different types of stakeholders in different ways. For example:
Growers – we use our marketing and sales practices to ensure that growers can get the full benefits of our products by improving yields and crop quality.
Industry – we engage with peers through industry organizations.
Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) – we partner with NGOs on specific issues.
Investors – we communicate and hold regular meetings with investors through our investor relations team.
Employees – we communicate regularly with employees and use local workshops to gauge their views.
Governments – we put forward our position on relevant issues and seek dialogue on those issues.
The Good Growth Plan exemplifies our engagement with stakeholders. In 2013, we commissioned a global research study involving over 7,500 people in 13 countries to assess their perceptions on the topic of food security and the challenges of agriculture. We listened to stakeholders and their concerns about our business, agriculture and the environment. As a result, we developed six commitments and we are seeking to work in partnership with governments, farmers, NGOs, international organizations and academics to take our contribution to a new level.
In 2018, we undertook three months of consultation with stakeholders from around the world in an effort to build a shared vision for the future of sustainable agriculture. Through listening and dialogue, we aim to better understand the role we can play and the commitments needed from all sides to help make a shared vision reality.

The biggest contribution we make to communities is through our products and services which help improve food security for many millions of people. We aim to increase the value that we share with communities by offering training and advice that help millions of farmers to improve productivity, increase resource efficiency, and earn a better living. As our business continues to grow, we also contribute through direct and indirect employment.
We also support local initiatives that address environmental issues, improve access to technology, increase health and nutritional awareness, and enhance science and education. We do this through direct financial contributions, in-kind contributions and staff time spent on sponsorship, donation and community engagement programs.
Our policy on sponsorship and donations sets out a global framework to ensure consistency in our approach and ensure we maximize the impact of our sponsorships and donations. Our main areas of focus are: water efficiency, land use efficiency, biodiversity conservation, health and nutrition, and science and education. We also support sponsorships and donations to culture and art, society, and sport to improve our engagement with local communities.
We also make donations to humanitarian organizations to support communities that have been affected by disasters. Our contributions target two key focus areas - health and nutrition, and the rebuilding of productive agricultural systems.
What type of community investment does do?
Our community investment programs focus on supporting the communities where we operate, as well as investing to promote long-term development. Our contributions include charitable donations, sponsorship, or in-kind investment through our people and products.
We focus our efforts in areas directly relevant to our business, where we can use our expertise to maximize support. These include: natural resource efficiency, biodiversity conservation, knowledge transfer to farmers in emerging and developing markets, health and nutrition, and science and education. We adapt our approach to suit local needs and engage on those topics relevant to our stakeholders.
What does the “Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture” focus on?
Based in Basel, Switzerland, the Foundation is a non-profit organization established by under Swiss law. The Foundation can access company expertise but is legally independent, and has its own Board.

Connect with usWhat is Syngenta’s position on intellectual property (IP)?
Intellectual property (IP) rights – especially patents – are enabling a functioning market economy in areas as critical as food security. They provide legal certainty to breeders who dedicate substantial resources to innovation over a long period of time. reliable legal framework prevents market failure and sets the stage for business cases that generate products farmers need to provide the growing global population with sufficient, healthy and nutritious food.
Patents also foster knowledge sharing because an invention must be fully disclosed for a patent to be granted. Through this mandatory publication of the patent, patents are one of the best ways of promoting knowledge-sharing and speeding up innovation.
An efficient system needs to consider the interests of the inventor and society in finding the right balance between fostering innovations and providing access to information for others to innovate further. rights prevent market failure by creating an incentive and a fair return for the investment of the innovator through licensing. In this way, can be an instrument to foster the dissemination, integration, and adoption of new technology. There is a collective responsibility to evolve the system from exclusion to inclusion and to access and fair benefit sharing. Licensing platforms are one way to achieve this objective.
is owned by a Chinese company. Does this affect its policy?
No. is a Swiss company. The majority of our global is owned by Swiss affiliates of Syngenta. transfer of these rights to Chinese entities is not foreseen.
ChemChina’s acquisition of will not change our balanced approach to nor lower our standards for protection. We remain committed to expanding our initiatives on transparency and open IP.
What is Syngenta’s position on systems in China?
China has made substantial progress in the development of laws and enforcement over the last decades. China today is the world’s number one in patent filing and within the top-5 tier in examination quality. While the enforcement of rights needs further strengthening, the establishment of dedicated Courts in major cities constitutes a substantial improvement.
ChemChina’s ownership of provides opportunities for accelerated improvement in protection in agriculture in China. is supportive of China’s intention to further strengthen the rule of law and to develop an innovation-driven economy.
How is used to protect plant-related innovations and seed?
Innovation relating to plant and seed development includes both conventional breeding, modern breeding techniques and methods of genetic modification. Modern techniques to create genetically optimized crops require substantial investment and lengthy development programs. As the resulting high-tech products are easy to copy by simple propagation, robust systems are required to protect these investments.
There are two primary forms of protection for plant-related innovation:
Plant Variety Protection (PVP): protects a new plant variety on the basis of the combination of all its phenotypical characteristics, and is suitable for varieties developed through traditional breeding. The term of a differs between countries and depends on plant species, but is generally between 15 and 25 years. rights have specific exceptions, for example the free use of the protected variety for further breeding, or the right for farmers to practice farm-save-seed (saving part of their harvest for use as seed in the next season).
Patents: Patents on plants are only available in a few countries. Patents protect inventions so they are better suited for new traits derived from technical processes such as genetic modification or marker assisted breeding. In contrast to PVP, a patent needs to describe the invention in a way that it can be reproduced by others. Patenting promotes knowledge-sharing. Patented plant-related innovations normally require substantial development time and research investments – a new genetically-optimized plant can require 13 years development time and cost of up to $200m. Normally, a patent is filed at the very beginning of the development phase. This reduces effective protection after market launch substantially below the full term of 20 years, often to less than 10 years. Additionally, there are no compensating mechanisms for regulated plants like the “Supplementary Protection Certificates” (SPC) that are available for pharmaceuticals and crop protection chemicals in many countries.
Patents and Plant Variety Protection (PVP) apply to innovations in different ways: while protects a plant variety as a whole but not its individual parts (e.g., a trait or gene), a patent protects new and innovative parts of a plant but generally not the plant as a whole.
Patents and are not alternatives, but complementary systems. Both are needed and can generate synergies if they are well-aligned. Where this is the case (e.g. in the and in Switzerland), it makes no difference for a farmer whether a specific plant is protected by or patents or both. lack of alignment can lead to debates and legal uncertainty, particularly in the case of high-value crops such as GMOs.
is in dialogue with stakeholders to further evolve the plant-related systems to ensure ongoing research and investment in crop plants. It is our view that a combination of industry-led solutions (e.g. licensing platforms ) and a harmonized legal framework of patents and PVPs (e.g. as implemented in the and Switzerland) could provide sustainable solutions enabling benefits for all parties involved and help foster food security across the globe.
Are native trait products and products obtained from PBIs patentable?
’Native trait products’ refers to the transfer of genetic material from closely related or sexually compatible species in order to develop a desired trait, such as drought tolerance. These plants can be the result of technical processes such as marker assisted breeding.
‘Products obtained from Plant Breeding Innovations (PBIs)’ refers to deliberate and precise changes to the plants genome to develop a desired trait. techniques help to overcome limitations of conventional breeding, and can expedite what could have been developed as a native trait product. 
Should regulation apply to all plants that are patentable?
No. believes that products obtained from Plant Breeding Innovations (PBIs), if they do not contain foreign DNA, should not fall within the scope of legislation. Regulators should evaluate the specific agricultural products based on their characteristics, not the technology used. Regulations, if needed, should be proportional to the risk, and science-based, focusing on the safety of the product. Every technology which complies with the patentability criteria (novelty, inventive step, industrial applicability and enabling disclosure) should be patentable. This is also true for PBIs and the products resulting therefrom.
What patents can be applied to crop protection products?
The development of new active ingredients for crop protection products can take more than 10 years and cost around $260 million. Protecting innovations through patents is essential to enable innovators to recoup this substantial investment. Inventions related to crop protection are not limited to active ingredients. They also include mixtures, formulation or more efficient production processes, which can add substantial value to farmers and mitigate risks such as development of resistance. The data submitted throughout the process to gain regulatory approval for a new product also has substantial value and requires adequate protection against unauthorized use by competitors. 
What is Syngenta’s view and contribution to patent transparency?
Patent transparency is straightforward for many products. However, if commercial seed material that unknowingly comprises a patented trait is used in breeding programs, this could lead to patent infringement by the new plant variety and the need of licenses to commercialize it.
supports the efforts of the European Seed Association (ESA) to increase transparency and enable breeders to understand the use rights on existing varieties by providing a greater level of data and information. has helped to develop the database , which provides patent information for plant varieties registered in the This database is accessible to everyone.
supports a balanced research exception in patent laws, which allows others to do research on an invention to enable further improvement of the innovation and shorten innovation cycles.
Most patent systems contain a research exemption, which allows further improvement of the invention. In countries without research exemptions (the US, for example), encourages researchers to enter into research license agreements to obtain additional, proprietary information and stewardship support. Such research agreements are used to ensure researchers abide by appropriate stewardship standards, to safeguard the confidentiality and of proprietary information and to secure the highest standards of sound science.
We undertake research projects with many universities and have thousands of research agreements with public sector institutions around the world. Our e-licensing initiative, TraitAbility , provides a facilitated way for researchers to access many biotechnology research tools – use is free of charge for non-profit institutes.
TraitAbility is one example of initiatives to facilitate access to innovations in the plant and seed area to promote innovation lifecycles in an area critical to food security. Our initiatives follow the principle of “free access but not access for free” and follow the example of Access and Benefit Sharing under the Convention on Biological Diversity and the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources in Food and Agriculture.
was among the first companies to make genetic information freely available for humanitarian purposes, in the shape of the rice genome. Similarly, supports the humanitarian initiative to make Golden Rice a reality. Syngenta, the Foundation and both of Syngenta’s legacy companies provided financial support and other resources to the inventors of this technology for a period of time. While we have no commercial interest in Golden Rice whatsoever, we continue to assist the International Rice Research Institute ( ) for regulatory and stewardship aspects of the project.
What is farm-saved-seed?
Farm-saved seed (FSS) is the practice of farmers saving part of the harvest for use as seed in the following season - usually in open-pollinated crops such as soy, wheat and rice. We recognize the right of farmers to practice within the limitations of the International Union for the Protection of new Varieties of Plants (UPOV) 1991 convention. This requires farmers to take into account the legitimate interests of the breeder. In practice, this should limit practices to those crops where seed saving is a traditional practice and should require farmers to pay a reasonable license fee for unless it is being used for private, non-commercial use.
Without proper controls and limitations, the extensive use of could reduces incentives to invest in productivity improvements of open-pollinated crops, which are the basis for food and feed, especially in the area of genetically modified crops like soybean. Uncontrolled use of can also lead to the spread of seed-borne diseases which can reduce yields.
will not enforce its plant variety protection rights against subsistence farmers for private or non-commercial use.
Does enforce plant-related rights in the Least Developed Countries (LDCs); is offering humanitarian licensing?
We do not enforce patents in seeds or biotechnology in Least Developed Countries (LDCs) by subsistence farmers for private or non-commercial use.
Counterfeited products - both crop protection and seeds - threaten the safety of our customers, farming communities, and the environment. There are also negative impacts on innovation, employment, technology transfer, and tax revenues associated with counterfeited products.
We investigate cases of counterfeiting and initiate legal action against counterfeiters where appropriate. To combat the distribution of counterfeit products, we are using features that are difficult to counterfeit, such as holograms and other visible and non-visible identifiers on packaging.
What innovative licensing solutions for breeders and plant innovators does offer?
As farmers face increasing challenges, we aim to find better ways of making our products and technologies more accessible to plant breeders and growers around the world and - together with others - develop solutions which increase the openness of the systems. By doing so we help ensure that companies, both large and small, can develop the diverse crop varieties required to grow more from less.
We recognize that obtaining licenses can be a lengthy and costly process, especially for small companies. Our e-licensing system TraitAbility is an efficient, facilitated licensing process that enables breeders, companies and public research institutes to access many of our most important plant-related innovations.
The use for research, breeding and development is free.
In addition, is a founding member of the International Licensing Platform Vegetables (ILP) an open licensing platform (Patent Clearing House) for vegetable breeding traits and varieties, launched in November 2014. This platform facilitates the quick and efficient licensing of vegetable breeding traits under fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, which are overseen by an independent expert committee. The has broad support in the industry: the current members represent more than 60% of the vegetable seed market. Furthermore, approximately 60% of all patents – more than 200 patent families - are already accessible through the This makes the the licensing platform with the highest industry participation in the life science industry.
supports the concepts of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources in Food and Agriculture and the principles of Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS), which seek to establish fair use of biological resources. carefully observes these principles in its partnerships and commercial planning and strongly objects to biopiracy or illegal bio-sourcing.
is concerned about the restrictive implementation of biodiversity laws and the Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing . Restrictions that go beyond the principles laid out in the would create very onerous conditions for breeders. The resulting legal uncertainty could endanger the use of the full range of plant genetic diversity for much needed breeding progress.
strongly supports the practical solution provided by the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources under the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and is committed to work with the Treaty and its stakeholders to further evolve and expand the Treaty towards a sustainable solution for all crops. simplified subscription model enabling the access to, and the utilization of plant genetic resources is in the best interest of all stakeholders. Such a subscription model would replace cumbersome trace & track obligations with a simple flat fee model based on a company’s seeds sales. It would establish legal certainty and a predictable, substantial financing of the benefit sharing fund, which is necessary to expand the Treaty to all crops. Ideally, this subscription model would apply at least to all large seed companies.
believes that the enforcement of the CBD/requirements should be kept separate from patent and other systems, and should instead be regulated by civil law. mandatory disclosure in patents of the origin of biological material should be limited to what is necessary for the enablement of the invention. This is already a requirement in the present patent law and does not need further amendments.
What impact will post patent/generic products have on Syngenta?
Patents on the first generation of genetically modified (GM) events (e.g. Syngenta’s Bt11 and GA21) have already expired in many jurisdictions. To avoid potential trade disruptions and ensure that competition and innovation in the industry continues, stakeholder initiatives such as The AgAccord framework have established predictable and transparent mechanisms that provide for the transition of regulatory and stewardship responsibilities for agricultural biotechnology events after patent expiration.
is committed to facilitate a seamless transition from proprietary to generic market under conditions that safeguard the long-term stewardship and durability of our products. We favor a product-by-product approach, rather than an approach that treats all products the same regardless of their functions, durability, regulatory status, and stewardship considerations. We will notify customer groups and the wider industry four years before we discontinue support for cultivation and import authorizations of products that are no longer covered by patents. If requested by parties interested in a generic use, we will engage our licensees three years prior to a patent expiring so that we can develop an agreed approach should they intend to continue working with the product after the patent has expired.
What is Syngenta's position on post patent/generic crop protection products?
Generic products make up around 30% of the global crop protection market by value. We welcome competition from generics but we believe that they must be subject to the same quality and safety standards as non-generic products. Our continuing innovation and product lifecycle management practices and our focus on the grower's needs help to stay competitive in an environment with generic products.
Connect with usHow are crop protection products approved for sale?
The crop protection industry is one of the most highly regulated in the world, with products subject to extensive evaluation before they are approved for registration and sale. To register a product we must first demonstrate that it meets the regulatory standards of the country, that it can be used safely by workers, and that it has no adverse effects for the environment and the crops that it will protect, and to the food that will ultimately be produced from those crops. The exact nature of the study process depends on the planned use of the product – but generally more than a hundred studies covering toxicology, metabolism, residues, ecotoxicology, physical-chemical properties and environmental impact are performed.
The studies required for approval are performed in accordance with internationally agreed test guidelines which can take up to five years to complete. Once submitted for approval, the regulatory authorities evaluate the data over a two to four year period before reaching a conclusion on whether or not the product meets the country's regulatory standards. Authorization to sell is documented with a "registration certificate" issued by the regulatory authority. Registrations are usually time-limited and re-registration will be required after a certain period of time, often 10 years after the first registration.
On average, the development of any new crop protection product takes eight to 10 years and costs around $286 million before a product is commercially launched.
Does regulation of crop protection products differ between markets/countries?
The data requirements for approval of crop protection products are broadly similar in most countries. However, the way that the data are used and the conclusions reached by the regulatory authorities in product evaluations can differ depending on how countries have chosen to define protection goals.
In the US, the regulatory system considers the risks that crop protection products pose under realistic agricultural conditions. This approach focuses on factors such as the quantity of a substance that will actually be used by growers.
In Europe, a number of additional hazard-based regulatory cut-off criteria have been introduced - meaning that active ingredients will not be eligible for approval if classified as, for example, a carcinogen, a mutagen or a reprotoxin. These cut-off criteria apply regardless of the use rates of a crop protection product or whether there is any real risk for undesirable effects in practice. In Europe, all our crop protection products comply with relevant Council directives and the EC's regulations on food safety.
What is a listing and are any products listed?
The Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure is a global treaty that came into force in February 2004 and which is jointly implemented by the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The procedure is designed to promote shared responsibilities in relation to international trade of certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides. The listing process does not involve an evaluation whether products can be manufactured and used safely. Also, does not constitute a ban or prohibition of affected products by FAO/or a recommendation by these organizations to do so.
No active ingredient or formulation is currently listed in Annex of the Rotterdam Convention  on the Prior Informed Consent Procedure (list).
No. Paraquat liquid formulations of type SL/at a concentration greater than or equal to 200 g paraquat ion per liter have been recommended for (Prior Informed Consent) listing as “Severely Hazardous Pesticide Formulations” by the Chemical Review Committee of the Rotterdam Convention based on a proposal from Burkina Faso.
In 2013, 2015, and 2017, the Conference of the Parties (COP), which is the decision-making body of the Convention, could not reach the required consensus on the paraquat formulations for listing in Annex of the Convention (the list). Further discussions were deferred to the next meeting in 2019.
It is Syngenta’s view that Burkina Faso’s listing proposal does not demonstrate that these formulations meet the definition of a under the provisions of the Convention. Burkina Faso’s underlying study on pesticide poisonings provides no evidence of severe health incidents involving the product under conditions of use. Paraquat is used safely around the world, popular with farmers and a vital tool for sustainable agriculture.
What is Syngenta's view on bees and neonicotinoids?
Over the last 10–15 years there has been a global debate about honeybee populations, and the short and long term effects of pesticides, and specifically neonicotinoids on them. Over time, many other influence factors over bee populations have been studied by scientists, including: diseases caused by viruses, parasites, and mites; poor nutrition; climate change; lack of genetic diversity and lineage; stress brought on by frequent transport of honey bee colonies; poor beekeeping management; and combinations of these factors.
More than one third of the world's crops depend on pollination, which means our business is reliant upon the pollination provided by bees and other pollinators. We conduct constant research on the environmental effects of our products, while helping beekeepers and farmers to maintain suitable areas for bee forage and beekeeping coexistence. Our Operation Pollinator program has helped boost the number of pollinating insects near farmland. It provides farmers with locally suited flower seed mixes and best practice advice to enable them to create bee friendly areas in field.
How are seeds products approved for sale?
All genetically modified (GM) seeds products are subject to intense regulatory scrutiny. We follow international guidance for assessing the safety of our seeds products. Our regulatory experts around the world stay in regular dialogue with relevant regulatory authorities.
New seeds products only reach the market after the rigorous and comprehensive safety assessments of their environmental, feed and food safety have been reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities.
Does regulation of seeds products differ between markets/countries?
New seed products are only placed on the market after the safety assessments have been reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities in that particular county. The general type of data required for obtaining approvals is similar in various countries.
The time between submission to regulatory authorities and approval does vary by country. Government regulations, regulatory systems, and the politics that influence them, can vary widely and are subject to change. Obtaining product approvals can be time consuming and costly, and data requirements for approvals continue to increase. In some countries, approvals are time-limited and must be renewed periodically to ensure that each product continues to meet regulatory standards.
We maintain high levels of stewardship for all our genetic modified (GM) products, helping us ensure compliance with regulatory standards. The processes we have in place are audited by the Excellence Through Stewardship (ETS) initiative – the first industry coordinated initiative that promotes the global adoption of stewardship programs and quality management systems across the full life cycle of biotechnology derived plant products.
Our focus on safety and the environment begins at the start of our product lifecycle. We are committed to complying with plant biotechnology regulations and we maintain a management system for handling our genetically modified crops that is modeled on 9001, the international quality standard.
Our regulatory compliance team works globally to ensure compliance best practices are shared and comprehensive compliance programs are available where needed. This approach, combined with the experience, knowledge and risk awareness of our employees, ensures that we maintain a high level of compliance.
What is the main challenge for the export trade of seed products?
As the export trade for major crops increases, one of the major challenges facing the industry is the harmonization of approval processes between major cultivation and importing countries. Approvals of genetically modified (GM) seed products occur at different times due to differences in country regulatory processes. Creating greater synergy between approval processes would facilitate trade and ensure choice of supply. We strongly uphold the right of growers to have access to approved new technologies that can increase both their productivity and crop yields. Read more on www.vipterafacts.com .
Several governments have signed a declaration of intent to work collaboratively on the issue of Low Level Presence of products where they have been approved in the country of origin but not in the countries of import – their aim is to facilitate improved international trade of agriculture commodities.
Does support the development and improvement of national legislation and regulation with respect to the approval of phytosanitary products and seeds?
National regulatory authorities sometimes ask for public participation to develop or refine regulation with regard to biosafety aspects or phytosanitary questions.
complies with regulatory requirements and has long experience of evaluating the safe use of our products. We are open to share our knowledge and to engage in dialogue with local regulatory authorities to help shape the regulatory framework.
We also support the development and improvement of regulatory systems by participating in initiatives and platforms bringing together industry organizations and regulatory authorities. Our staff is closely involved in the  ‘ Principles of Regulation ’ Regulation’ initiative from CropLife International which provides building blocks for new regulation and measures for continuous improvement of existing regulation.
How does support farmers using seeds in complying with national legislation and international conventions such as the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety?
contributes to the work of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety through the Global Industry Coalition (GIC). was established during the negotiations on the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety to provide concrete, reliable and accurate information for countries involved.
strives to fully comply with the framework of existing national legislations and we are in an ongoing dialogue with regulatory authorities as our products move through the product life cycle. Commercial regulatory approvals of products often include post-launch regulatory obligations for the technology developer and their customers, as for example Insect Resistance Management practices.
customers learn about these requirements through our comprehensive education programs that include the use of websites, face to face meetings, direct mailings, and product labeling. This education material often includes customer support contact information in the event the customer has a question related to stewardship requirements. also partners with key external stakeholder groups such as industry associations and local farm groups to help deliver the messages to customers. has also developed innovative solutions to enable our customer’s to more easily comply with the requirements. As an example, the integration of refuge seed into the bags of our insect-protected products helps growers to fulfill the refuge planting obligation.
Product safe use and stewardship
What does do to make sure its products are used safely?
We are committed to the responsible and ethical management of our products throughout their life-cycle; we call this stewardship. Ensuring that our products are used safely is our priority.
Under The Good Growth Plan , we have committed to train 20 million farm workers on labor safety by 2020. Our aim is to drive real improvement in stewardship knowledge, attitudes and behaviors around the world. Together with expert partners, we are constantly reviewing our training approach to equip our 30,000 frontline trainers around the world with the skills, knowledge and tools for effective stewardship.
In developed markets, industry authorities often provide training and guidance to users. In countries where this guidance does not exist, we train growers to handle products safely. In some areas low levels of literacy and little access to training can make it difficult to correctly read product labels or directions for use. Face-to-face training is complemented by safety messages on crop protection products through a variety of media including picture based training, actor-led dramas, and even and radio programs. We also provide specialist information to growers through our online platform “Pesticidewise” .
We monitor the response of growers to different safety messages, including the effectiveness of our training programs, in order to ensure that these important messages are understood by those who need them.
More information on this topic is also available in our Sustainable Business Report (p. 25) .
has established toxicovigilance programs in 100 countries globally. These programs include agreements with poison centers or hospitals to offer a 24 hours, seven days a week medical information support for patients who were exposed to pesticide products.
The information collected from reported incidents feeds a database that serves to improve our pro-active stewardship programs and provides information to include in our dossiers for regulatory submissions. In addition, we frequently train physicians to improve medical treatments in the case of pesticide-related incidents.
We are committed to promoting full and effective stewardship from discovery to commercialization for all our plant genetically modified (GM) products to maximize the benefits and minimize any risk from using them. We believe that the appropriate management and use of our products is an important element underpinning sustainable agriculture and safeguarding the environment and public health.  
Our plant biotechnology stewardship lifecycle starts with gene discovery, includes plant development, seed production, seed marketing and distribution, crop production and crop utilization, and ends with product phase-out. We have worked with others in the agricultural biotechnology industry to develop and maintain the following stewardship programs to promote responsible management of plant biotechnology:
Insect and Weed Resistance Management
We provide information on genetically modified (GM) technology and the benefits it can bring through open dialogue. We work with industry partners such as Crop Life International and the Council for Biotechnology Information to provide accurate and impartial information on the safety and benefits of technology. Other organizations that also provide information include the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications and the Biotechnology Industry Organization .
good source of accurate information is Answers , where people can ask questions to experts.
We are committed to helping farmers around the world grow more and better quality food while using fewer natural resources. This means adopting sustainable farming practices that are more resource efficient and developing solutions that help farmers grow more from less.
Sustainably increasing farm productivity will add value to rural economies and make sure that land fertility is maintained and improved. Our best management practices are designed to provide farmers with simple, practical measures that enable them to work more productively and sustainably with the resources they have. Working closely with growers and stakeholders, we have developed simple measures that enable farmers to identify the issues and associated risks specific to their operation.
Farming relies on biodiversity – it is crucial for crop pollination, healthy soils and water purification. At the same time, farming, and increased cultivation, can also have impacts on biodiversity. In The Good Growth Plan , we have committed to help biodiversity flourish by enhancing biodiversity on 5 million hectares of farmland by 2020.
We support projects that demonstrate the importance of biodiversity and resource management in the production of high-quality and sustainable crops. We work with farmers to help them understand the importance of managing biodiversity on their farms. For instance, our Operation Pollinator program aims to increase populations of bees and other pollinating insects through the planting of locally suited flower mixes within field margins.
Crop diversity is one of the world's least recognized but most valuable resources. The conservation of crop varieties is essential to meet future challenges, such as food supply and those associated with climate change. Many initiatives on a local, national or supra-national level aim at preserving the genepools for future use and research. We work with seed banks around the world to share and protect the genetic diversity of food crops and we are a donor to the Global Crop Diversity Trust - a foundation committed to conserving crop diversity for global food security.
