Join LOFSince 2008, has been a world-leading inventor, developer, and manufacturer of high-efficiency color cells. is also a tribute to Professor Loferski, a cell pioneer, who was a great teacher and inspiration to Lofâ€™s founder when hestudied at Brown University. Each day, Lofis devoted to making the world greener, merrier, and prettier via colorful Building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) solutions.
Dr. Joseph John Loferski (1925-1997), a physicist and pioneer in the development of modern cells, was born in Hudson, Pennsylvania, In 1953, he received a doctorate degree from the University of Pennsylvania. Dr. Loferskithen went on to serve as an emeritus professor of engineering at Brown University, where his book, Methods of Improving the Efficiency of Photovoltaic Cells, was published in 1972. In the span of his research career, he authored 150 technical papers and 5 books focused on photovoltaic cells. What Dr. Loferski and other early cell researchers demonstrated was that semiconductor devices might one day produce commercially competitive, pollution-free electricity.
