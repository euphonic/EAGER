Teledyne Introduces a New Automated Sample Preparation System
Introducing the new sample preparation system for preparing samples, standards and dispensing in environmental, mining, pharma and soil labs. The 'SimPrep' Simple Automated Prep System.
​Omaha, / February 27, 2018 - Teledyne introduces a new automated sample preparation system to the market.  This system is designed to automate the sample preparation process for environmental, mining, pharma, clinical and soil laboratories.  The SimPrep utilizes the industry standard ASX-560 or ASX-280 autosampler, both manufactured by Teledyne CETAC, and a high precision dual syringe pump with flexible, simple software.  Both the autosampler and syringe pump have proven to be robust, fast, accurate and precise solutions to laboratories worldwide.
“The SimPrep is a labor saving sample prep system for the complex to simple sample preparation found in today's labs, which saves on the bottom line of the laboratory" says Gary Preister, Teledyne Business Development Manager. “We are very excited to release this solution to assist our customers in eliminating the manual sample preparation steps performed on a daily basis," adds Preister. 
Benefits of the new SimPrep simple automated prep system:
Acidified samples
Wide range of syringes from 20 microliter to 50 milliliter
single system can serve multiple techniques such as ICP-MS, ICP, AA, Colorimeter, and FIA.
About Teledyne Teledyne Technologies, based in Omaha, is a worldwide leader in sample handling and sample introduction for elemental analysis. Teledyne develops, manufactures and markets a family of products and services for customers around the world, for use in every industry where rapid and accurate determination of trace element concentrations is required.

Teledyne Releases the Most Powerful LA-ICP-Imaging Software on the Market Today
Introducing the – HDF-based Image Processing Laser Ablation Software​.
​Omaha, / July 3, 2018 - Teledyne releases the Software for laser ablation systems.  This software is designed to process imaging data quickly and efficiently with powerful simplicity. 
“With recent developments in sample chamber designs allowing for faster data acquisition, the amount of data has increased.  This increase has caused problems for laser ablation users because there was no solution available to address this.  Data handling for elemental imaging has also been a very cumbersome and only semi-automated at best. These problems are resolved, thanks to the software,” stated Damon Green of Marketing for Teledyne software was developed in close collaboration with Professor Vanhaecke and Dr Van Malderen at the University of Ghent and is now exclusively available through Teledyne Green added, “vastly simplifies the processing of the huge data files generated by scientists working with elemental imaging applications. It is simply the most powerful and flexible imaging software tool available today.”
Unique features of the (HDF-based image processing software) include: 
Fully automated image optimization for highest resolution 
Several ‘Autopilot’ functions that automate data reduction and building of publication-ready 2and 3multi-element images.
Automated optimization function to suggest optimum analytical parameters (spot size, rep rate, dwell times, etc.) based on the user’s analytical needs.
Allows powerful data manipulation including full quantitation, drift correction, interrogation of datasets acquired to output region of interest data

Teledyne Introduces the Next Generation Homogenizing Autosamplers for Oils Applications
​Omaha, / July 17, 2018 - Teledyne introduces the next generation homogenizing autosampler for oils, wear oils and coolants for sample introduction for ICP- The Oils 7400 and Oils 7600 Homogenizing Autosamplers are built on the Teledyne ASX-7000 automation platform, which has been proven as a robust, fast, accurate and precise platform. 
“The Oils Autosamplers were designed to meet the requirements of the rapidly evolving oils testing industry” says Jacob Herrington, Teledyne Product Manager. “We are very excited to release these new autosamplers to our customers because they will realize sample analysis time savings compared to previous systems.” “While first and foremost these autosamplers are faster, we have also improved xyz movement accuracy and precision and product design thus generating many unmatched benefits to users not available with other systems on the market today,” adds Herrington. 
The Oils 7400 and Oils 7600 were designed to meet the needs of the evolving wear metals market, which means a quick and easy way to convert for coolant analysis.  The unique dual pump/dual rinse station design, allows for a fast and easy transition between two different matrices.  These systems were designed to allow users to do more with one autosampler than was ever possible before. 
Dual Rinse Design 
Segregated rinse station provides clean washout for aqueous and oils samples while preventing carryover and contamination.
Separate pumps ensure that there is no need to change the tubing on the rinse station when switching between oils and coolants.
Faster Movement 
Faster and smoother xyz movement saves up to 2 seconds per sample analyzed compared to previous generation oils automation.
In conjunction with the Teledyne ASXpress® Plus Rapid Sample Introduction system, 2 samples can be introduced to ICP-instrumentation per minute for 5185 (oils) and 6130 (coolants).
Accuracy and precision of xyz movement to sample tube and rinse station destinations improved to ± 0.4 mm.
Eliminates the possibility of missed samples and damage to probe/stirring paddle.
An improved drip cup design allows for more effective sample drip capture and retention, even at high speed, ensuring that sample contamination between sample tubes is eliminated.
