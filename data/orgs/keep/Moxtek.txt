Engineering innovation is a lifestyle. We live and breathe it everyday as we focus on precision solutions that will empower cutting-edge technologies to shatter barriers and advance scientific breakthroughs. See the possibilities.
In 1986, began with a collaboration, resulting in an exciting first breakthrough—our ultra-thin polymer X-ray window. This got us hooked on discovery. So alongside our partners, we continued to push the limits of performance in projection, imaging, and optics, completely revolutionizing the technology along the way.
Since then, we’ve become a leading supplier of advanced nano-optical and X-ray components for display electronics, imaging and analytical instrumentation. 
Collaboration at The Core
We’re involved in the caliber of innovation that demands collaboration. Our current and future partners are vital in our advancements to develop and manufacture new technologies. We consistently welcome new customers, new partners and new ideas because these are at the core of our mutual success. 
Attention to detail is built into our development and manufacturing culture.  We focus on quality in all activities to produce the very best results and products.  Our goal is to be your preferred supplier or partner. We get there by infusing a high level of attention and detail into the things you care about.
From Moxtek, you should always expect an extreme commitment to customer satisfaction, quality control requirements, continual improvement, and effective collaboration.

I've made it a high-priority goal to work with happy people, and day after day, that's what get at Moxtek.
You don’t have to go far to get out of the city to live in a more calm and rural setting – and even the big city isn’t so big.
never stops—in a great way. especially love my role in ensuring that our products are on the leading edge. We're always searching and finding that new way to improve our products—and those next applications of our technologies.
Utah skiing- It's what enjoy about our location more than anything. My resorts of choice are The Canyons and Snowbird.
truly appreciate the independence experience at Moxtek. Coming up with ideas, deciding where to go with product lines, then making it happen. It's all a part of the lifestyle.
What don't enjoy about Utah? love its people, its nature and its recreational activities. really get into the great mountain biking, hiking, canyoneering and skiing. 
makes very interesting products, and enjoy being a part of it.  get to associate with great people every day.
Within thirty minutes from our facilities, can go rock climbing, snow skiing, water skiing, fishing, and mountain biking.
get to work with a diverse group of intellectually talented people; all of which are really genuine. They make the work place and our entire industry better.
When am in Utah am home. grew up here and feel a deep connection to this place.  The mountains, the streams and lakes, and even the high desert feel as natural to me as my own living room.
Frankly, like a good challenge. And customers always raise unique and interesting ones to tackle. Every day is different, giving me the motivation need to find new and innovative solutions.
am proud of core technology of miniature size and high tech films.  We see a lot of high impact opportunities to enter new markets with new ideas.
am from Utah and love the unique outdoor opportunities the state offers.  As travel the world, I'm reminded that there's no place like home, there is no place like home.  
Utah is an amazing place. have come to love the four seasons, the mountains and even the fabulous, expanding food and drink selections. New tech companies are always opening, bringing in people from all around the world and making a unique and diversified culture.
is all about Innovation. Due to constant changes of customer requirements, ensures that the organization is able to adapt based on the current customer requirements hence, we revolutionize and innovate our products. enjoy being part of such an organization that does great things for people not only in terms of technology but also in terms of connecting with people.

Research Partners | Your partner in advancing
Together we achieve more, because the sum
of the parts is greater than the whole.
Easily collaborate with our team of experts.
For over 25 years has improved the quality of life through expert partnerships and consistent breakthroughs in science and technology. has partnered with many prestigious private and government research institutions as well as small and large businesses. You can join in the history of innovation as our research partner. 
Chemplex Industries, Inc., based in Palm City, Florida, is an industry leader in the X-ray spectrochemical sample preparation field. They consistently dedicate their efforts to innovation and responsive advancement of the industry. As such, they engaged in a partnership to assist in an exciting project. 
Side-by-side, Chemplex and worked to develop a homogeneous sample that would fluoresce low-energy x-rays for making repeatable x-ray transmission measurements through thin films. We attribute the success to the minds of both organizations.
Nanofab, a History of Collaboration
has a long history with the University of Utah’s Nanofab, a facility dedicated to furthering research through collaboration.  Together we’ve worked on a variety of projects ranging from chemical analysis to analytics. We most recently collaborated on Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). This dealt with the thin film conformal coating on our Gen 5.2 protective product line. We worked together to study material properties and to give valuable experience to university students. 
Eastern Applied Research and Eastern Applied Research, Inc. has been providing analyzers to its customers for the past twenty years.  Eastern Applied Research and both focus on creating solutions that meet our specific customer needs.
and Eastern Applied Research have collaborated on many projects over the past decade.
Eastern Applied works with to develop new coating materials for our x-ray source research. We’ve also collaborated on the specifications and needs for our instrumentation equipment.
4Technology & Perfecting the Polarizer
4Technology based in Tucson, Arizona, designs and manufactures laser interferometers, surface roughness profilers and interferometry accessories, for accurate measurement of optics, optical systems and precision machined surfaces. 
In Moxtek’s efforts to better our polarizer and their product, we worked with 4to obtain feedback on the performance of their sensor arrays and on the interaction of our polarizer with the array. This feedback was necessary in creating a part that could perform short exposure measurements accurately, while functioning in a cold space environment on the James Webb Space Telescope. Our partnership helped us reduce reflection, crosstalk, and interference patterns to achieve the overall performance requirements of their product using our improved polarizer.
There are few endeavors more exciting than space exploration. Alongside one of the world's top space agencies, we pushed the limits of their technology and ours. Moxtek's team of experts collaborated with some of the top minds in the world, and the result was a custom version of our X-ray window that fit into their state-of-the-art planetary explorer. 
It was a proud moment for our team when our technology made it to Mars, helping to further the efforts of space exploration.
specializes in the development and manufacture of accessories and optical systems that enhance the performance of commercial spectrometers. 
works with Pike in creating custom polarizers to meet their specific product needs. Our polarizers are used in Pike’s FTIR, NIR, and UV-Vis spectrometer accessories. This partnership has enabled to develop new and improved accessories, and has provided a platform for to continuously improve our technology and services. 
At Moxtek, we believe that our future lies in productive collaboration. Let us know if you are interested in working together.
