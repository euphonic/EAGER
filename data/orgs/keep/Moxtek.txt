Engineering innovation is a lifestyle. We live and breathe it everyday as we focus on precision solutions that will empower cutting-edge technologies to shatter barriers and advance scientific breakthroughs. See the possibilities.
Innovating Since 1986
In 1986, began with a collaboration, resulting in an exciting first breakthrough—our ultra-thin polymer X-ray window. This got us hooked on discovery. So alongside our partners, we continued to push the limits of performance in projection, imaging, and optics, completely revolutionizing the technology along the way.
Since then, we’ve become a leading supplier of advanced nano-optical and X-ray components for display electronics, imaging and analytical instrumentation. 
Collaboration at The Core
We’re involved in the caliber of innovation that demands collaboration. Our current and future partners are vital in our advancements to develop and manufacture new technologies. We consistently welcome new customers, new partners and new ideas because these are at the core of our mutual success. 
Extreme Quality
Attention to detail is built into our development and manufacturing culture.  We focus on quality in all activities to produce the very best results and products.  Our goal is to be your preferred supplier or partner. We get there by infusing a high level of attention and detail into the things you care about.
From Moxtek, you should always expect an extreme commitment to customer satisfaction, quality control requirements, continual improvement, and effective collaboration.

Research Partners | Your partner in advancing
Together we achieve more, because the sum
of the parts is greater than the whole.
Easily collaborate with our team of experts.
Let’s discover hidden
Consider us part of your research team.
For over 25 years has improved the quality of life through expert partnerships and consistent breakthroughs in science and technology. has partnered with many prestigious private and government research institutions as well as small and large businesses. You can join in the history of innovation as our research partner. 
Research Partners
Chemplex Industries, Inc., based in Palm City, Florida, is an industry leader in the X-ray spectrochemical sample preparation field. They consistently dedicate their efforts to innovation and responsive advancement of the industry. As such, they engaged in a partnership to assist in an exciting project. 
Side-by-side, Chemplex and worked to develop a homogeneous sample that would fluoresce low-energy x-rays for making repeatable x-ray transmission measurements through thin films. We attribute the success to the minds of both organizations.
Nanofab, a History of Collaboration
has a long history with the University of Utah’s Nanofab, a facility dedicated to furthering research through collaboration.  Together we’ve worked on a variety of projects ranging from chemical analysis to analytics. We most recently collaborated on Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD). This dealt with the thin film conformal coating on our Gen 5.2 protective product line. We worked together to study material properties and to give valuable experience to university students. 
Eastern Applied Research and Eastern Applied Research, Inc. has been providing analyzers to its customers for the past twenty years.  Eastern Applied Research and both focus on creating solutions that meet our specific customer needs.
and Eastern Applied Research have collaborated on many projects over the past decade.
Eastern Applied works with to develop new coating materials for our x-ray source research. We’ve also collaborated on the specifications and needs for our instrumentation equipment.
4Technology & Perfecting the Polarizer
4Technology based in Tucson, Arizona, designs and manufactures laser interferometers, surface roughness profilers and interferometry accessories, for accurate measurement of optics, optical systems and precision machined surfaces. 
In Moxtek’s efforts to better our polarizer and their product, we worked with 4to obtain feedback on the performance of their sensor arrays and on the interaction of our polarizer with the array. This feedback was necessary in creating a part that could perform short exposure measurements accurately, while functioning in a cold space environment on the James Webb Space Telescope. Our partnership helped us reduce reflection, crosstalk, and interference patterns to achieve the overall performance requirements of their product using our improved polarizer.
There are few endeavors more exciting than space exploration. Alongside one of the world's top space agencies, we pushed the limits of their technology and ours. Moxtek's team of experts collaborated with some of the top minds in the world, and the result was a custom version of our X-ray window that fit into their state-of-the-art planetary explorer. 
It was a proud moment for our team when our technology made it to Mars, helping to further the efforts of space exploration.
specializes in the development and manufacture of accessories and optical systems that enhance the performance of commercial spectrometers. 
works with Pike in creating custom polarizers to meet their specific product needs. Our polarizers are used in Pike’s FTIR, NIR, and UV-Vis spectrometer accessories. This partnership has enabled to develop new and improved accessories, and has provided a platform for to continuously improve our technology and services. 
At Moxtek, we believe that our future lies in productive collaboration. Let us know if you are interested in working together.
