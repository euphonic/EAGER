National and local jurisdictions’ regulatory requirements are becoming ever more diverse, complex and stringent regarding environmental management. Of course, affiliates globally are required to meet applicable environmental regulatory requirements. Our environmental management system draws upon globally-accepted best practices from all regions, establishing an environmental protection baseline standard to which national and/or local regulation may add.  The majority of our sites are certified to ISO14001 alongside RC14001 certification for chemical manufacturing facilities.
Our water program includes assurance of waste water effluent streams, so they are properly characterized, permitted and are compliant with discharge requirements. Waste water management processes focus on upstream contaminant reduction in addition to effluent treatment. All our sites are expected to have storm water pollution programs in place. These plans outline measures, such as inspections, secondary containment, and spill prevention, to minimize the discharge of pollutants in storm water conditions. Training is provided to personnel through general awareness training modules in addition to site-specific training.
We recognize the importance of water resources and pursue water usage reduction efforts across our business. Corporate sustainability goals and dedicated resources help to ensure a reduction in water-usage intensity.
Our planet's resources are finite and we are obliged to use raw materials efficiently.  Where waste is created, we seek re-use options and ensure we are effective management of any residual material. Elements of our waste management program include effective and compliant waste identification, segregation, packaging, labelling, storage and transportation. We routinely review our waste treatment and transportation partners to ensure downstream compliance and effectiveness. All of our sites are encouraged to prevent, reuse, recycle and/or recover/reclaim materials prior to identifying disposal as the appropriate waste path.
Most of our chemical production facilities around the world have national government specified limits for emissions to the air. Compliance with these limits requires specific expertise, infrastructure and focus on often complex regulations.  Our air emissions compliance program is based on identification and location of emission sources and implementation of emissions reduction steps. Processes and emissions control system are monitored as part of an overall program to ensure that air emissions remain below permitted limits.
Whilst air, water and – to some extent – waste have received international attention over a long period of time, the potential for releases to soil and groundwater is also increasingly regulated, giving rise to a variety of regulations and standards worldwide. and its affiliates use impervious barriers to protect soil and groundwater where this is required.  Even where not required by regulations, our require facilities to assess the risks to soil and groundwater in order to identify the need for physical structures or barriers to protect soil and groundwater, whilst also prescribing monitoring of system integrity and consideration of systems for groundwater monitoring wells based upon risk. Hence our provisions can exceed local legislation.

SABIC’s creation by royal decree in September 1976 was a bold step for a developing country. It marked a move into using the by-products of oil extraction to produce value-added commodities – such as chemicals, polymers and fertilizers – for export. These commodities were also intended to develop local downstream industries, and meet the requirements of various market segments. What was once wasted gas flared into the atmosphere is today a valuable resource to produce eco-friendly, lucrative materials for the benefit of humankind.
During the late 1970s and early 1980s the fishing village of Al-Jubail in eastern Saudi Arabia transformed into a modern industrial city, with the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu building the infrastructure, and building the factories, acquiring technology through joint ventures.
SABIC’s expansion began in 2002 with the acquisition of DSM’s petrochemical business in Europe, with manufacturing facilities in The Netherlands, Germany and the acquired Huntsman Petrochemicals (UK) in 2006, and renamed it Petrochemicals, adding substantial capacity to it Europe operations. In 2007, acquired Plastics, now its Specialties Strategic Business Unit, opening the way for advanced materials, offering value-added products to customers.
continues to explore investment opportunities, strengthening its production, technological and marketing capabilities, and further consolidating its leadership position in the world.
SABIC's growth has never stropped since its inception. In 1985, the company's total production was 6.3 million metric tons, reaching 70.4 million metric tons in 2015. In the span of just 40 years, occupies a prominent position among the world's largest petrochemical companies, with a vision to be the preferred world leader in chemicals.

. In 2010, adopted a Code of Ethics that consists of 15 policies covering three broad areas: (a) Our Environment; (b) Our Workplace; and (c) Protecting our Assets. The Code of Ethics requires all employees to obey the law, be honest and trustworthy. These policies reflect our commitment to integrity and corporate citizenship, including our commitment to Responsible Care®, the United Nations Compact, and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.
In addition, we believe there are two fundamental elements to create an effective compliance culture -- leadership engagement and employee commitment. Our leaders are responsible for creating the basic systems of preventing, detecting and responding to compliance issues and for creating a culture of compliance through leading by example. At the same time, each employee is responsible for understanding the compliance risks that impact his/her job. All of our employees are asked to acknowledge their understanding of the Code of Ethics annually and to complete assigned training on the policies contained in the Code of Ethics. We have a responsibility to raise integrity concerns or violations promptly - failure to do so can have significant adverse consequences for our company, ourselves, our fellow employees and the communities in which we live. We strictly prohibit retaliation of any kind against anyone for raising or helping to address an integrity concern.

Principle 1 - Support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights
As a member of the United Nations Compact, is dedicated to creating and fostering a culture of respect and fair employment practices that prohibits all forms of illegal discrimination. Our Fair Employment Practices Policy not only requires compliance with all labor and employment laws in each country where we employ people, but also sets a standard of behavior that respects all people. Finally, it requires that employment decisions are based upon merit, capability, performance and other job-related criteria as consistent with local law. All employees are trained every two years on our Code of Ethics. also has a compliance reporting system and strict no-retaliation policy, so that all employees, suppliers, customers and other stakeholders can report compliance concerns to our Legal Department. All credible concerns are promptly investigated and acted upon.
As we strive to achieve our 2025 strategy of being the preferred world leader in chemicals, is dedicated to the highest standards of ethical, social and environmental responsibility. Both new and existing suppliers are evaluated and selected for reasons beyond just the price and quality of the product and/or service offered. We also look closely at each supplier’s commitment to provide safe working conditions, to act fairly and ethically, and to use environmentally responsible practices. Our Supplier Due Diligence Program asks suppliers detailed questions about their use of underage and forced labor, working conditions and other inquiries designed to ensure that our supply chain is free from human rights abuses.
Principle 3 - Uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining
In SABIC, the right to join labor unions, workers' councils, or other collective bargaining organizations is granted, in compliance with applicable law. Where labor unions are not permitted by law, offers employees the right to join labor committees, which are representative bodies to address employee concerns with management.
Our Code of Ethics Fair Employment Practices Policy states that we will observe all applicable labor and employment laws wherever we operate, including “the prohibition of forced, compulsory and child labor.” As mentioned above, our Supplier Due Diligence Program also asks suppliers detailed questions about their use of underage and forced labor.
does not employ underage workers. As mentioned above, our Supplier Due Diligence Program asks suppliers to disclose any use of child labor. finding of child labor in Due Diligence would be grounds for non-qualification of that supplier or for mitigating actions to ensure that child labor is not used in the production of goods for SABIC.
Principle 6 - Elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation
Our Code of Ethics Fair Employment Practices Policy states that we will observe “those laws that pertain to the elimination of any improper employment discrimination.”

Resource and Energy Efficiency, pp. 34-40
The Precautionary Approach is based upon implementation of sound methodologies to assess and manage risks posed by an activity. has integrated risk assessment and risk management practices into our Company processes, including assessment and management of risks to human health, safety, security, and the environment (EHSS). For example, all manufacturing operations are subject to initial and periodic risk assessments. In addition, we include risks in our assessment of the products that we manufacture. Consistent with the Precautionary Principle, these risk assessment practices do not require scientific certainty before cost-effective risk mitigation actions are considered. Our focus on reduction of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) (see below) is a prime example of the Precautionary Approach.
Principle 8 - Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility
Resource and Energy Efficiency, pp. 34-40
Our long-term strategy (2025) includes manufacturing footprint goals for greenhouse gases (GHG), energy, water, and material loss to be achieved through process, operating, and technology improvements. Reduction in emissions is a key focus area for the Company. CO2 emissions reductions are being pursued through improvements in our own operations and also improved supply chain logistics and marine transportation fuel switching.
Within our own business, we have established the Manufacturing Center of Excellence (MCE) to share our sustainability efforts across different sites. Through MCE, we have managed to develop a robust data collection and analysis process for our environmental footprint. Many of the local community-based efforts and much of the scientific research we support are designed to promote a culture of environmental conservation.

Principle 10 -Work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery
As a manufacturing company, we rely on the ability to move our products across borders around the world each day. Eradicating corruption at points of entry is crucial to our business success. 2016 was an active year for SABIC’s anti-corruption efforts. participated in the Business 20 (B20) Anti-Corruption Forum in Beijing, China in April 2016, the focus of which was to make concrete, actionable endorsements to the governments of the world’s 20 largest economies (G20). Azlan Nageli, SABIC’s Chief Regional Counsel, Asia Pacific, participated in a panel entitled “Sharing Anti-Corruption Experience between Multinational Corporations and Emerging Markets.” In May 2016 held events in Riyadh and Jubail to highlight our efforts around sustainable procurement, including preventing corruption in the supply chain. The events were held with the Siemens Integrity Initiative and the Pearl Initiative – a non-profit organization promoting a corporate culture of accountability and transparency as a key driver of competitiveness across the Gulf region. The Riyadh event was opened by Dr. Ali Al-Kheshaiban, Director of Department of Promotion of Integrity, Nazaha (Saudi National Anti-Corruption Commission). This was followed by a panel session entitled “Attracting International Customers and Investment through Supply Chain Compliance.” Panelists included Khalid Al-Hussan, CEO, Tadawul (Saudi stock market), Ahmed Al-Shangiti, Procurement Services, SABIC, Khalid Al-Aseeri, Legal Advisor, Ministry of Economics & Planning, National Transformation Project, and Andreas Glogowsky, Corporate Account Manager, Siemens. During the session, private sector and government participants, including Dr. Hanan Al-Ahmadi, Shoura Council, heard perspectives on the business imperative for ethical business and why stakeholders - both and regional - are increasingly requesting evidence of good compliance practices in the Saudi supply chain. Speaking at the panel session, Ahmed Al-Shangiti, Vice President, Procurement Services, SABIC, said: “The wealth that comes into Saudi Arabia through the opening of the Tadawul will be directed, at least in part, to those companies that present the lowest business risk. At SABIC, we are reducing risk in the supply chain by requiring our suppliers and vendors to demonstrate that they embrace the same strong compliance culture that our business is built upon. In the future, we will award business to those suppliers and vendors that offer us the best product, lowest price and strongest compliance practices.”
Over 100 suppliers attended to learn about key initiatives from Procurement, including the latest developments in supplier relationship management, supplier compliance and details around our new supplier due diligence program. In order to help our suppliers to develop their own compliance programs, all in attendance were given a takeaway assignment – an online anti-bribery training course that offered in conjunction with Trace International. Training suppliers and other third parties on anti-bribery is a best practice which we are offering to our suppliers in Saudi Arabia to help reinforce our message that strong compliance is a business imperative for SABIC.

We operationalize our compliance culture through a variety of processes and operating rhythms described below:
To promote an atmosphere where our employees feel free to raise concerns without fear of retaliation, we have established a organization of Compliance Helpline Leaders who are responsible for receiving concerns and ensuring that all concerns are properly investigated and addressed. In addition, employees are all trained that they can also raise their concerns with any manager, or with the Human Resources or Legal organizations. The number and type of concerns raised to the Compliance Helpline Leaders are measured and tracked, and are periodically discussed at several regional Compliance Review Boards established by the Company.
For several years, business has conducted a Compliance Review process that is designed to engage our employees to assess compliance processes, prioritize key risks and develop mitigation plans to address those risks. The process includes a Bottoms Up Review during which each exempt Manager must meet with his/her direct reports and cover the following:
a review of each policy in the Code of Ethics;
a review of Bottoms Up output from prior reviews;
a general discussion encouraging employees to freely surface compliance concerns without fear of retaliation.
Each compliance concern that is raised is recorded by the Manager and addressed either during, or within a reasonable time after, the Bottoms Up Review is over.
In 2008 and 2009, the participation rate of the relevant population in the Bottoms Up reviews was over 90 percent The results of the Bottoms Up review are then discussed by management which develops a summary of the issues raised and any other existing and emerging risks that could adversely impact the organization. This process results in the development of risk mitigation or action plans for the highest priority risks. These plans include assigning the responsibility for mitigation actions to particular individuals, with required dates for completion. The progress towards completion of the plans is tracked on a monthly basis, through a digitized system tracker and is also discussed at the periodic meetings of the Compliance Review Boards (see below).
In 2011, initiated a Code of Ethics review for senior-level employees. The new process consists of a Bottoms Up Review of the Code of Ethics in manager-led discussions, with over 2500 employees participating. As with the previous process, the results of these reviews are discussed by management and risk mitigation plans are developed and tracked for the highest priority risks.
In 2012, will institute a bottoms-up compliance review program as well as a review for all enterprise risks.
Oversight of SABIC’s compliance program is performed by a network of regional Compliance Review Boards. These Boards meet periodically to identify any new significant compliance concerns, review the activities of the Compliance Helpline Leaders, and monitor the completion of the integrity training required of our employees.
One way that we try to ensure compliance with our Code of Ethics is to require all employees to be trained on the specific requirements of the Code. In an effort to better equip employees to recognize and respond to increasingly complex compliance challenges, our company’s Legal team developed a comprehensive web-based compliance training program. This program reviews each policy in detail, and includes questions that must be answered correctly to show understanding of the requirements. Currently, our company requires that all employees take four General Awareness courses on the basics of all of the policies. In addition, there are another 31 advanced courses that are more detailed and are assigned to employees based on their roles within the company. This approach allows employees to complete training with particular focus on those compliance policies and practices that pertain most directly to the issues they face in performing their job duties. Our employees are required to take an average of about 15 advanced courses during a two year training cycle. Several of our compliance courses are available in the languages most commonly used by our employees. In 2010, the rate for the completion of required training in was 97 percent for General Awareness courses, and 90 percent for advanced courses. For 2011, the respective completion rates were both over 98 Percent.
Another feature of our compliance training program is the executive level training delivered by our company’s senior leadership, with the support of the Legal team. This training is designed to train senior management on the compliance responsibilities of a leader, emerging compliance risks, how to conduct compliance investigations and a review of our compliance infrastructure. In 2008, 98 percent of the executive staff participated in this program. During 2010, the executive level training was rolled out to businesses outside of the business, and was given to 95 percent of the target audience. Additional Leadership training will be conducted periodically.
In addition to Code of Ethics specific training, we also conduct live training on high-risk areas (e.g. EHSS, International Trade and Antitrust). For example, we track required training in EHSS, and the completion rate for 2008 was 99.8 percent, 2009 was 93.86 percent, and 2010 was 99.39 percent; the training completion rate for training on International Trade Sanctions was 95 percent of the relevant population. In 2010 the training was rolled to businesses outside of and targeted audiences were trained in Anti-dumping, International Trade, Compliance, Antitrust and Intellectual Property. In 2011, over 3500 employees were trained in these risk areas.
We have implemented a program to help ensure that our suppliers adhere to ethical standards and comply to the fundamentals of our Code of Ethics and policies, including: fair employment practices, no underage or forced labor, reasonable hours of work and wages, no discrimination, freedom of association and matters such as providing a safe work environment, pollution prevention, waste minimization and recycling, and safe and secure transportation of materials. We perform due diligence on all direct material suppliers at varied levels dependent on each suppliers’ risk potential. For all suppliers, we undertake inquiries that range from questionnaires, to interviews, to thorough on-site inspections. We have performed reviews of over 2700 suppliers in over 50 countries, including over 700 on-site inspections. On-site inspections have been performed for over 80 percent of SABIC’s annual direct material buy for manufacturers located in emerging countries. In addition, our standard forms of contract contain multiple provisions designed to ensure our suppliers meet our integrity standards and expectations.
Several digital tools enhance the robustness of our compliance program. Our watch list screening system screens orders to ensure we comply with all applicable government sanctions and trade restrictions and that we are doing business only with reputable entities. In addition, our leadership team has been committed to engage our employees through frequent communications on compliance responsibilities. Compliance is consistently made an agenda item at staff meetings.
