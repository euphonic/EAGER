Photonic Curing is the high-temperature thermal processing of a thin film using pulsed light from a flashlamp. When this transient processing is done on a low-temperature substrate such as plastic, paper or glass it is possible to attain a significantly higher temperature than the substrate can ordinarily withstand under an equilibrium heating source such as an oven.
Our products, technologies, and team are enabling printed electronic applications world-wide.
Our well-equipped print-and-cure lab has flexo , screen , inkjet , spray and other ink deposition technologies for client use. NovaCentrix welcomes processing of samples and pilot rolls with the assistance of our team of process engineers.
Photonic soldering, using PulseForge® tools, is being developed in a partnership with Holst Centre (Eindhoven, Netherlands) and NovaCentrix (Austin, TX).
NovaCentrix, based in Austin, TX, is pleased to announce it has exclusively acquired the technical and business-related intellectual property (IP) of Intrinsiq Materials in an asset sale by Intrinsiq Materials investors.

Any time of year is a great time to come to Austin. Nestled at the edge of the Texas Hill Country, Austin is known for its vibrant live music scene, large swaths of green space in the middle of downtown, and tech-minded folks. Great food, including Tex Mex and barbeque, is one of the great attractions. Golf, cycling, jogging, and lake sports are popular in this outdoors-oriented city
We look forward to your visit.
NovaCentrix offers industry leading photonic curing tools, conductive inks, material and expertise enabling development and production of next generation printed electronic devices – some already on the market. PulseForge® tools utilize photonic curing which is a cutting edge technology that dries, sinters, and anneals functional inks in milliseconds on low-temperature, flexible substrates such as paper and plastic. PulseForge tools can save time and money, and enable new types of products in applications like solar, RFID, display, packaging, and circuit. Our Metalon® conductive inks capitalize on advanced materials and formulation to provide conductivity options for additive manufacturing of printed electronics with stretchable, solderable, resistive, and magnetic qualities.
NovaCentrix partners with you to take ideas from inception to full production. Our PulseForge tools continue to revolutionize the printed electronics industry through photonic curing, enabling product innovators and manufacturers the option of flexible, low cost substrates and functionality not possible with conventional ovens and lasers.
Our customer base includes consumer and military electronics manufacturers as well as academic and scientific research and development organizations. These manufacturers and organizations are scattered across the globe including Europe, Asia, India and the Our customer sales and support teams are located in China, South Korea, Germany, Netherlands and the NovaCentrix’s design and manufacturing center is located in Austin, Texas.
NovaCentrix team develops, patents, and commercializes new technologies in printed electronics, nanoparticle manufacturing, pulsed power equipment, and related fields.
