Energy is Total's history. Having produced oil and gas for nearly a century, has also branched out into renewable energies and electric power. As a global energy leader, we leverage our pioneering spirit and capacity for innovation to address new challenges and prepare for the future. Our 20-year ambition is to become the responsible energy major.
From 1920 to the Present
Total's history began in 1924, with the creation of Compagnie Française des Pétroles (CFP). At the time, we produced oil in the Middle East. Over the years, we have expanded internationally and diversified into gas, refining, petrochemicals and petroleum product marketing, as well as solar power, bioenergies and energy storage. We have been innovating for nearly 100 years to meet our customers' expectations.

Like our history, the values of Safety, Respect for Each Other, a Pioneer Spirit, the need to Stand Together and a Performance-Minded attitude represent that part of Total’s identity that is shared by all. Day in, day out, these values guide our actions and our relationships with stakeholders while serving as the foundations for achieving our collective ambition, which is to become the responsible energy major.
	Safety is a daily battle that needs to be waged with humility and vigilance. We can never drop our guard with respect to Safety. It is a core component of our responsibility as an industrial company as well as the linchpin of our long-term viability, because we can only be sustainable if we are safe and reliable. 
	For this reason, we believe that Safety deserves to be more than just a priority: it should be a value. This means that we have to be uncompromising when it comes to Safety and always treat it as a matter of both individual and collective responsibility. At Total, one person’s safety is everyone’s safety.
	Based on this mindset, we can achieve our objective of being recognized as 
the benchmark for safety in our industry.

	Respect for Each Other is a value in which every word has equal weight. It puts people at the center of our collective project. Each day, we strive to embody this principle by maintaining good work relations and listening to each other, paying the utmost respect to human rights, displaying unwavering integrity, embracing diversity and paying attention to the quality of labor relations within the company. 
	Respect for Each Other is therefore a cornerstone of our

We are the first oil and gas major to publish a dedicated report on upholding human rights in our operations. Based on United Nations guidelines, the report explains to the public how we incorporate human rights into our operations and business relationships in our many host countries.
. Because our domestic resources are virtually nonexistent, we have had to cultivate this Pioneer Spirit to build our business and develop strong positions all around the world. In doing so, we have risen to the rank of energy major. 
Continually spurring us on, this Pioneer Spirit gives us the boldness, sense of adventure and courage to conquer new territories and resolutely embark on a strategy that welcomes other energies. Every day, it encourages us to be curious and innovative and teaches us how to adapt and overcome adversity. This value has driven us in the past, still drives us today and will continue to do so tomorrow.

Stand Together reflects how we interact, as seen in the team spirit that enables us to confidently face the unknown together. Even though has some 98,000 employees, we still rightly think of ourselves as “family”.
With respect to our employees, we Stand Together to empower everyone to grow in a caring environment and draw support from our strength as a team.

In practical terms, how can we ensure everyone's safety everywhere we operate? At Total, we deploy a rigorous, structured operational approach that involves identifying risks, taking preventive ation and monitoring on a regular basis. This approach shapes the daily work of our employees and partners.
Safety is a prerequisite in our business. We can't operate without it. Our company’s reliability and sustainability depend on safety, which explains why it is so crucial to understand industrial risks and be rigorous and systematic in applying safety rules. These rules inform our safety approach and create the conditions for achieving our objective of being the benchmark for safety in our industry.
To effectively anticipate potential issues, we systematically assess risks before a project or operation begins. Our comprehensive analytical methodology involves:
Analyzing the most significant risks in detail.
Implementing safety action plans in accordance with a priority scale that compares the level of severity with the likelihood of the event occurring.
The analysis continues throughout the operations in accordance with the same safety requirements.
Leveraging this data and knowledge, we devise safety systems, rules and measures that minimize risks. This can involve redesigning facilities and structures, strengthening protection procedures and updating production equipment.
In addition, crisis management plans are in place so that we can respond quickly and appropriately if an accident occurs. We also regularly organize drills to ensure these crisis plans are effective.
To ensure safety every day, our first focus is to create a culture of high standards. This means 
To establish them, we have increased the number of working groups with our peers to exchange best practices and know-how. This safety collaboration was particularly active in 2010 after the Macondo blowout in the Gulf of Mexico, which led the entire industry to review its procedures.
We can also limit risks by performing inspections. Our installations undergo safety inspections throughout their entire life cycle. Monitoring involves 
verifying compliance with our operating procedures. 
ensure that our maintenance work and inspections are effective.
 In addition, we continuously monitor the expertise of all of Total's players, in every region and sector, from production to processing to distribution.
to continuously improve our performance, we need to create a 
 By distributing the rules to as many people as possible, raising awareness among staff about safety issues, increasing training and offering effective tools, we are investing in safety every day so that it becomes an integral part of our working habits.
The Challenge: the search for tomorrow's oil and gas robot
Our exploration and production operations are often conducted in harsh and challenging conditions, including extreme cold, arid climates and isolated locations. Because autonomous robots able to operate at our onshore and offshore sites would strengthen the safety of our teams, has partnered with the French National Research Agency (ANR) to create the Challenge with the objective of encouraging the invention of tomorrow's oil and gas robot.
