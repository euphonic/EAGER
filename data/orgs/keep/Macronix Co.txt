Furthermore, in the era of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Vehicles (IoV), the critical requirements for a successful memory solution are memory size, power consumption, and performance; all of which can be realized by the new ultra-high performance OctaFlash Memory.
Macronix's newly launched ultra-high performance OctaFlash (x8 I/O) Memory can operate at frequencies up to 250MHz with a fast latency access time of 80 nanoseconds (ns), sequential byte reads as fast as 2ns and a maximum read throughput of 500 megabytes per second (MB/s), the fastest in the industry. The new ultra-performance OctaFlash Memory can meet the instant-on and interactive graphical user interface (GUI) requirements of next generation electronics.
Macronix's new ultra-high performance OctaFlash Memory is packaged in an industry standard 24-ball and is backwards compatible with existing Quad and Dual-Quad pin-out patterns, allowing users to easily migrate and minimizes any significant routing re-design.
The new ultra-high performance OctaFlash Memory is manufactured with Macronix's advanced, high-reliable 55nm process. Samples of 1.8V, 256Mb & 512Mb densities are available now.
About Macronix, a leading integrated device manufacturer in the non-volatile memory (NVM) market, provides a full range of Flash, Flash and products. With its world-class R&and manufacturing capability, continues to deliver high-quality, innovative and performance-driven products to its customers in the consumer, communication, computing, automotive, networking and other market segments.

Read-While-Write (RWW) Flash Now Adopted by Renesas’ Automotive Instrument Cluster RH850/D1M1MCU
​Hsinchu, Taiwan, 6th August, 2018 – Co., Ltd. (TSE: 2337), a leading integrated device manufacturer in the Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) market, today announced that Renesas Electronics has implemented dedicated octa peripheral interface to support memory devices with Serial Multi I/O.  Among these memory devices, the MX25LW5124Read-While-Write Flash is selected by Renesas for its high-end RH850/D1M1automotive instrument cluster microcontroller (MCU) for Over-The-Air (OTA) update. The RH850/D1M1is part of Renesas’ RH850 Family of MCUs that offers high performance balanced with very low power consumption over a wide and scalable range of automotive products.
Macronix’s Read-While-Write (RWW) Flash offers an ideal solution for Over-The-Air (OTA) update applications, which are becoming more prevalent within Automotive Cockpit solutions. Automotive Electronic Tier1’s are striving to meet end customer demand for the most updated features and changes in safety standards. One of the most cost effective methods is to have regular updates via During an operation, the instrument cluster system might update data and code while in mid execution. In the past, to implement an Over-The -Air update, a system would typically execute a Simultaneous Read-While-Write (RWW) operation in two separate Flash devices – by writing to one Flash device while reading from another Flash device. In this scenario, the system would have to reserve double the normal bandwidth, which of course will lower performance, but also require significant redundancy in terms of Flash memory capacity.
The MX25LW51245Flash from provides multiple bank architecture with Simultaneous Read-While-Write capability that allows read access from one memory bank while writing to another memory bank. This feature enables the system to continue executing during the update process happens in the background; furthermore, the system can roll back to its original firmware in the event of an failure or data corruption.
Renesas has implemented dedicated octa peripheral interface to support memory devices with Serial Multi I/O, including the Flash memory. Macronix’s Flash memory is key to enabling customers to offer an effective, high performance and cost-effective solution for a new generation of Instrument Clusters which will dramatically enhance the driver experience by offering configurable clusters with regular updates. Macronix’s Flash memory solutions are manufactured with its own ultra-reliable, high quality 55nm Floating Gate technology, which is part of the 10-Year Product Longevity Program (MPLP).
Macronix, a leading integrated device manufacturer in the non-volatile memory (NVM) market, provides a full range of Flash, Flash, and products. With its world-class R&and manufacturing capability, continues to deliver high-quality, innovative and performance-driven products to its customers in the consumer, communication, computing, automotive, networking and other market segments.
