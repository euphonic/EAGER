“went home feeling empowered and validated, realizing that asking for help is worth it. Most importantly, left knowing that although my battle with mental health was not over, had an endless army of fighters standing with me.”
“My team, we get a lot of referrals from our crisis team and inpatient unit so the trend that we deal with is the trend of suicide and how prominent it is in the community. We work closely with families and schools to focus on safety and prevent hospitalizations. All of the small successes along the way are what keep me motivated.”
“I’ve been in the mental health field coming up on 15 years and I’ve worked with a variety of patient populations but think there’s something special about working with kids. They’re at a pivotal and vulnerable point in their life where you can really make a huge impact.”

zip code should not determine a child’s health.
Studies show that health outcomes are influenced by a “neighborhood effect” — meaning that health outcomes vary based on where a person lives. 
Factors that can affect health include access to health care, housing, education, employment, relationships, transportation and food supply.
 Children’s Hospital’s aspiration is to eliminate inequities in child health.
We work toward our aspiration by:
Several programs are designed to remove barriers to accessing resources:
Care Connection
 – Primary care, behavioral health and school-based asthma therapy are offered in central Ohio schools through school health clinics or the Mobile Care Center. All programs are designed to connect children to a medical home.
– The Birth Control for Teens Program is a place for young women up to age 22 to talk with medical experts about birth control and sexually transmitted infections and get the birth control that's right for them — with no judgment.  
One example of this support is 
Ohio Better Birth Outcomes
, a collaborative between four central Ohio systems, a local federally qualified health center and public health, which is dedicated to reducing the infant mortality rate in Franklin County. 
The area health systems use quality improvement science to not only improve clinical care, but also connect pregnant women to other community resources to help ensure healthy birth outcomes.
Healthy Neighborhoods Healthy Families
 initiative partners with faith-based organizations, community development organizations, youth-serving nonprofits and local public schools to focus on creating positive health outcomes in the community. 
Programs support affordable housing; workforce development and employment opportunities; health and wellness; neighborhood safety; and improved educational outcomes for children and families on the South Side of Columbus.
Partners For Kids
, a partnership between and more than 1,000 doctors, is one of the nation’s oldest and largest pediatric accountable care organizations.
Partners For Kids at a Glance:
330,000 children cared for
34 counties in central and Southeastern Ohio served
More than 1,000 doctors participate

Patient-and-Family-Centered Care
When your child comes to Children’s Hospital, we welcome you and your family, too.
It’s good for our young patients to keep their families close. Having you near gives them strength and comfort. It makes them feel better. It can even help them heal better. That’s why we treat you like a member of our health care team.
We value your thoughts and ideas about their treatment plan. You can share your family beliefs, customs and way of life so we know what your family needs and wants. Tell us all the special things about your child — how we should explain things so they understand, what they like and don’t like, and what they plan to do once they go home.
That’s what we mean by patient and family-centered care. It guides everyone in our organization, as we work together to satisfy the emotional, spiritual, social and medical needs of our patients. 
You can rest assured that… 
You will always know and understand what is happening with your child.
Really good communication is at the heart of patient and family-centered care. We share information with you, your child, your family members — even your community groups, schools, other health care agencies and specialists. Everyone who is important to your child’s improvement will get the information they need. You can help us do that.
We have what you need to be comfortable here.
Hospitals are busy, noisy places. To reduce stress and worry, you need a place of calm and comfort. So we designed our spaces so families can be with children in privacy and comfort according to their needs. In fact, the parents and grandparents of children treated at Children’s told us exactly how to create a feeling of home where you have everything you need to relax, play and be together whenever it’s possible.
Families are treated with respect.
You are never “in the way,” even when we look busy. If you have a question, we will answer it. Everyone at Children’s is responsible for caring for your child — and for you. We all understand the stress you feel when your child is here for care. And we all strive to be professional, respectful and helpful — with you on our team, we can make sure your child’s needs are being met.
Our Family Advisory Council: Partners in Care, Partners in Hope
We created a Family Advisory Council  to make sure we are meeting the needs of children and their families in every way possible. Council members may be parents, grandparents, or guardians of patients cared for by in recent years. They make our patient and family-centered care stronger and better.
The Family Advisory Council also recognizes outstanding efforts by the staff, clinicians or medical teams at Children's. Partners in Care, Partners in Hope is its annual award for excellence in patient and family-centered care.

Everyone Matters: Diversity & Inclusion
The foundation of an organization is its people. At Hospital, we align our strategy with the Best People and Best Programs to achieve the best outcomes. We also know diversity, combined with our authentic progress to build an inclusive culture, enables our employees to bring their unique differences and talents to work every day.
We believe Everyone Matters. The strength of our comes from what we each bring to the table to improve patient, families, and each other’s lives. 
diverse and inclusive team where every person is vital to improving children’s lives everywhere. 
At Hospital, more than 11,000 employees come together every day to deliver the best outcomes for children from all over the world. We recognize that a child’s zip code, age, race, economic status, and education should not determine their health outcome. We also recognize our employees are valuable to our organization because of their differences. 
Our made a promise to not only acknowledge, but foster and celebrate the diversity of each other, our patients, families, visitors, and many physician and community partners. Why? Because being inclusive and welcoming makes us better-suited to take care of those who need our help. 
Diversity is about bringing together a kaleidoscope of individuals who work collectively to achieve best outcomes. Each individual has unique qualities and experiences that contribute to our mission and values. Through diversity, we are able to achieve the highest standards of inclusiveness and create a culture that respects individual differences that best represent the community. It is the cornerstone of our strategic plan and how we attract the best people to ensure the best programs. 
At Hospital, not only does everything matter, but everyone matters!
Our vision is an inclusive and diverse culture that fosters mutual respect, where our staff and physicians are valued and provided opportunities to achieve their full potential. We recognize an inclusive and diverse culture is grounded in a firm commitment to attract and retain talent, reflective of the communities we serve. One way of accomplishing this goal is with our Employee Resource Groups (ERGs).
Seven Aligned Employee Resource Groups
Employee Resource Groups are teams of employees with common backgrounds, goals and interests, formed to act as a cultural resource for both group members and the entire organization. ERGs are typically associated with a culture or perspective that has traditionally faced challenges in the workplace. Some of the groups formed to support each other are working parents, veterans, ethnic and geographical backgrounds, and young career professionals. 
Our resource groups promote professional development, peer networking and provide opportunities for participants to engage in the work of diversity and inclusion. The purpose is to positively impact the organization’s culture in a manner that benefits participants and the organization.
Everyone Matters has Two Focuses
Inclusiveness: With our collective mixture of people each with a variety of abilities, skills, experiences and cultural backgrounds, we are creating an environment where everyone feels heard, respected, appreciated, challenged and engaged.
Health Equity: As a key enabler of our safety and wellness platform, we will: look at equitable care in health for our communities we serve; and address gaps in health outcomes or care we provide as a result of our own internal bias or lack of cultural awareness.

Saving Money by Improving Health for our Most Vulnerable Children
One of the nation’s oldest and largest pediatric accountable care organizations, Partners For Kids is a partnership between Children’s and more than 1,000 doctors, and is an extension of Children’s long-standing mission of serving all children regardless of their ability to pay.
As an accountable care organization, Partners For Kids brings together health care providers to offer high-value, coordinated care to a defined patient population. Partners For Kids acts as a bridge between the state’s five Medicaid Managed Care Plans and the actual care that approximately 330,000 children in central and southeastern Ohio receive under those plans.
Since its founding in 1994, Partners For Kids has proven that it can provide high-quality care at a lower cost.
Partners For Kids at a Glance:
330,000 children cared for
More than 1,000 doctors participate
“Partners For Kids takes the traditional focus on health care and shifts it to a focus on children’s overall health. It is the premier innovative pediatric health care delivery model in the country.”
- Nick Lashutka, president of the Ohio Children’s Association
High Value, High Quality Care
Physician incentives for quality care, better drug prescription practices, care coordination and a focus on illness prevention have led to cost savings and better care for children.
Physician Incentive Program
Physicians are incentivized on target areas of child health that need to be improved. One example is through adolescent well-child visits, key for keeping children healthy. Many adolescents are not scheduling these exams. Taking it a step further, the organization will send physicians call lists for patients due for visits. Partners For Kids staff members will even travel to physician offices to help them schedule wellness appointments.
Care coordinators assist children with medical complexity and their families to navigate uneventfully, efficiently and as effectively as possible through the health care system. Data from 2014 show that patients enrolled in care coordination for at least 120 days saw inpatient admissions and emergency department visits decrease.
Pharmacy Program
Partners For Kids’ Pharmacy Program works to hold down prescription costs in several ways while still providing patients with the medication they need. 
Measures of Success
All of these cost savings programs have led to steady or improving measures of quality care and patient outcomes.
Asthma patients visits to the Emergency Department decreased almost every month in 2015 from comparable months in 2012-2014.
“Ohio’s focus is on value – quality care at a sustainable cost. We want to create an environment where every provider is on a path to value arrangements. It is very helpful to have Partners For Kids as an example we can point to of an organization that has done it the right way.”
Reinvesting in Child Health
To get the best outcomes possible, Children’s and Partners For Kids understand the importance of keeping children healthy in their neighborhoods and schools.
Some community programs and services that have benefited directly from Partners For Kids savings include:
Integrating Professionals for Appalachian Children (IPAC): This rural health network works to increase well visits for teenagers, access to long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARC) and prenatal care for young mothers.
Chapter Quality Network Asthma Project: This program of the Ohio Chapter, American Academy of Pediatrics, helps pediatricians implement national guidelines to improve the care and outcomes of children with asthma.
School-Based Asthma Therapy: Children who enroll can receive this medication at school, and their parents can be trained to dispense the medication at home, which increases school attendance and decreases Emergency Department visits.
Welcome Home: The Welcome Home program from Children’s helps teenagers with the transition after their behavioral health inpatient stays.
Partners For Kids Earns Certification in Credentialing
Partners For Kids has been certified by the National Committee on Quality Assurance (NCQA) in Credentialing. certification is a voluntary process that is governed by the Standards for Certification in Credentialing, developed with the assistance of representatives from NCQA’s Standards Committee, Review Oversight Committee, and input from other organizations.

It also recognizes clinicians and practices in key areas of performance. is committed to providing health care quality information for consumers, purchasers, health care providers and researchers. has reviewed and certified Partners For Kids’ Credentialing functions only.

It's Cold and Flu Season - Visitor Restrictions Now In Place
During cold and influenza season it is necessary for Children’s to take extra precautions to protect the health of our high-risk inpatients by restricting certain inpatient visitors from entering select inpatient units. Beginning Monday, November 26, 2018, all inpatient visitors must be healthy and 12 years of age and older for the intensive care units, the neonatal units, H4A, H8and Hematology/Oncology.
Patients/parents will be asked to identify up to four additional people, 12 years of age and older, they wish to visit during their stay. It does not matter what the relationship is to the patient (grandparent, aunt, uncle, sibling, or support person, etc.). Parents should call Admitting by dialing 2-2210 from the room and share the four names chosen. Until this happens only parents and grandparents will be able to visit.
The four names given will be listed in the patient’s medical record. Only visitors with their name listed will be able to visit the patient for the duration of visitor restrictions. The four names cannot be changed unless approved by the Nurse Manager/designee or the Nursing Supervisor. Please speak with your caregivers if there is a need to make any changes.
Visitors under 12 years of age will not be able to access the unit, including the waiting rooms, playrooms and family lounges.
Clergy are allowed to visit and are not included in the four additional names.
We know visitor restrictions can make it hard for families to keep in touch so here are five ways to keep in touch with patients:
! These get delivered directly to our patients.
Patients can borrow Skype units from the 
– plan a time to talk!
Visitors can call the Gift Shop and purchase a 
 to be delivered to patients.
Parents can drop off younger siblings (age 3-12 years) at 
, a sibling care center.
Hematology/Oncology patients have access to the Internet through our Patient Edutainment system, so siblings, family and friends can use social media to stay in touch!
Our number one priority is to make sure our patients avoid exposure to the colds and viruses circulating in the community this time of year. Your questions and feedback are important to us. Please do not hesitate to speak with your caregiver about these visitor restrictions.
