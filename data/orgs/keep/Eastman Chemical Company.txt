has played a major role in many areas of history. This tradition of leadership and innovation has affected our past and will continue to direct our future as a pioneer and leader in an ever changing global market. Our core values of quality, innovation and teamwork provided the framework for our success.
Glimpses of our heritage can be found beginning in World War The war caused a scarcity in raw materials such as photographic paper, optical glass, gelatin and many chemicals, including methanol, acetic acid and acetone. At the close of the war in 1918, Kodak founder, George Eastman, was determined to have an independent supply of chemicals for his photographic processes. In his search for suitable quantities of methanol and acetone, turned his attention to the Southern United States and its forests, and to Kingsport, Tennessee. In 1920, Tennessee was founded with two major platforms - organic chemicals and acetyls. From the primary feedstock of pyroligneous acid, many of Eastman's basic building blocks were manufactured, studied and perfected. Products such as calcium acetate, sodium acetate, acetic acid and acetic anhydride became the basis for other major platforms.
The next World War brought more involvement for Eastman. RDX, a powerful explosive, was manufactured for the government at Holston Ordnance Works at Tennessee sites. At the peak of production, close to the end of the war, the ordnance plant was producing a million and a half pounds of explosives each day. management became the operations lead on the Y-12 plant of Clinton Engineer Works, which helped develop the atomic bomb. Eastman's involvement was demanded because we were seen as a "get something done" company.
Expanding Products and Capabilities
In the decades that followed, Eastman's portfolio of products continued to expand. By the late 1960's, Tennessee was manufacturing scores of products that were fast becoming familiar features of everyday life. Polyester fibers for apparels and home furnishings, plastics for the automobile industry, and a growing number of industrial chemicals were serving an ever expanding customer base. Our physical presence around the globe grew as well with the emergence of sales offices and the construction of manufacturing facilities in strategic locations.
is the first manufacturer in the to develop and commercialize technology that derives chemicals from coal, rather than petroleum. The first coal gasification facility began operation in 1983 in Kingsport, Tenn. and in 1995 was designated a National Historic Landmark by the American Society.  
Eastman's commitment to quality was recognized when the received the prestigious Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award in 1993. The following year, spun off from Kodak and became an independent corporation.
The rich history of innovation continued in 2007 with the development of Tritan™ copolyester. This new generation copolyester offers innovative design and application possibilities along with clarity, toughness, heat and resistance. This is our next step in our commitment to maintain our leadership position through technology and innovation.
Eastman's innovative products continue to make life safer, easier, more convenient and more enjoyable. From its beginning more than 90 years ago, has grown to be a leader in the global industry. Our cutting edge products enhance the lives of people around the world and still bear the name of the man who started it all, George Eastman.

is driving innovation by identifying and assessing global macro trends and disruptions.
We recognize that understanding where our world is going is critical to ensure the value of our products in our future. We started by assessing our projects against macro trends in 2016, but in late 2017, we took this a step further and launched our product sustainability assessment. As we understand our projects individually, we are elevating this to look at the impact of our collective portfolio. For example, we have set our sights on best practices to enable carbon reductions and offsets in manufacturing processes, and we have established a team to help address the growing impact of plastics in our waterways and ocean. 
We know that applying our global experts and world-class technology platforms to the world’s challenges will allow us to create a pipeline of sustainable innovation that enhances the quality of life in a material way.
