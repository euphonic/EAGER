Eisai's corporate philosophy includes the realization of human health care (hhc).
Based on a clear understanding that patients as well as their families and consumers are the key players in healthcare, we seek to have a sense of pride in providing benefits to such persons. This philosophy is summarized by the term “ hhc .”
We believe that in order to truly consider the perspectives of patients and their families, it is important for each employee to first get close to patients and see the situation through their eyes to learn to pick up on thoughts and feelings that might not necessarily always be expressed in words. It is this concept that is the starting point for all of Eisai's corporate activities. Accordingly, the Group recommends that all of its employees spend 1% of their working hours with patients.
Our corporate philosophy is understood and internalized by each employee within the Group, both in Japan and overseas. This understanding is then shared and implemented in the daily business activities of all employees, and serves to effectively transcend nationalities, national borders, and gender and age.
We fulfill our obligation to society by considering the perspectives of patients, their families and the global community overall, developing a response to their needs, verifying the social benefits of this response, and finally by making this response available to the world before anyone else.
This is the hhc that aims to realize.
The Group's Philosophy Logomark combines inspiration from the life and dedication of Florence Nightingale (1820-1910), who made enormous contributions to the development of the nursing profession and public health, with our own hhc philosophy. As such, the script for the logo is modeled on the signature of this prominent figure, who we regard as having played an immense role in the history of modern-day nursing.This website is for shareholders, investors, and members of the media.

has pursued the best corporate governance practices and has remained committed to the improvement of this governance for the purpose of fulfilling  hhc , the company's corporate philosophy. Since June 2000, has appointed directors from outside the company, and in June 2004, revised its Articles of Incorporation at the Annual General Shareholders' Meeting and adopted the Company with Committees System (currently, Company with a Nomination Committee, etc., System). At the same time, the number of outside directors has been increased to account for the majority of the Board of Directors. This is intended to ensure the fairness and transparency of our business management and, as a consequence, the management supervision function has been strengthened.
remains committed to the sustainable improvement of its corporate governance in pursuit of increasing the benefits to stakeholders including patients, customers, shareholders and employees.
Clear Separation of the Functions between Oversight of Management and the Execution of Business
The central aspect of Eisai’s corporate governance is the clear separation of the oversight of management and the execution of business by fully utilizing the fact that it is a Company with a Nomination Committee, etc., System.
The Board of Directors with outside directors making up the majority is able to enhance the vitality of and devote its attention to management by entrusting a large portion of the decision-making authority over business execution to corporate officers to the extent permitted by the laws and regulations. In accordance with the Companies Act, the Board of Directors has passed resolutions on rules for the Systems for Ensuring Proper Business Operations to establish specific internal controls that should be established and operated by corporate officers. In addition to the items set forth in the rules, corporate officers work to enhance and operate the internal controls within the scope of their responsibilities to secure autonomy and increase the speed and flexibility of business execution.
Under this structure, the Board of Directors also checks the status of execution of duties by corporate officers and inspects the appropriateness of the status of internal controls, such as the business execution and decision-making processes, from the perspectives of shareholders and society.
Furthermore, in order to achieve a clear separation between the oversight of management and the execution of business, has established that the chair of the Board of Directors be an outside director and that the Representative Corporate Officer and be the only individual to concurrently serve as a corporate officer and a director.
Sustained, Autonomous Mechanism for Enhancement of Corporate Governance Centered on Outside Directors
The presence of 7 independent outside directors, who account for the majority of the Board of Directors, supports the effectiveness of Eisai’s corporate governance structure. has established and is operating a mechanism to enhance sustained, autonomous corporate governance centered on outside directors, including (1) a system of electing neutral and independent outside directors by a Nomination Committee, (2) operating the Board of Directors, etc., through the leadership of a chair who is an outside director, (3) an Outside Directors Meeting for broad discussion of corporate governance, including consideration of a succession plan, etc., and (4) corporate governance evaluations that drive the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle of the Board of Directors and each committee. We will continue to work to enhance the contents of each of those efforts.
Efforts to Ensure the Independence and Neutrality of Outside Directors
When electing outside directors, the Nomination Committee places the utmost importance on ensuring the independence and neutrality of outside directors.
The work of selecting candidates for outside directorships begins with creating a list of candidates. In addition to directors who are currently serving, the Nomination Committee asks Eisai’s former outside directors, who have extensive personal networks, to create a list of candidates, and updates the candidate list every year. The Nomination Committee screens the candidate lists for independence, competition, and other related matters, narrows down the candidates in accordance with the requirements for new candidates for the relevant fiscal year, then determines the candidates for whom requests for appointment will be submitted. After the decision is made, the Chair of the Nomination Committee promptly meets with the candidates, and submits requests for appointment to Eisai’s directors.
In addition, the Nomination Committee strictly applies the “Requirements for the Independence and Neutrality of Outside Directors” (hereinafter “the Requirements”), stipulated by the Committee, for the selection of candidates for outside directors. Every year, the Nomination Committee examines each outside director candidate, whether for new election or re-election, to determine whether he or she meets the Requirements and to assess his or her independence and neutrality. 
inspects the Requirements each year, and revises them as necessary, to respond to changes in laws and regulations as well as standards of securities exchanges, etc., and also from the perspective of improving corporate governance.
Chair of the Board of Directors (outside director)
selects the Chair of the Board of Directors, the central figure in Board of Directors operation, from the outside directors. In order to enable the Board of Directors to make fair and appropriate judgments on behalf of shareholders and other stakeholders, the Chair of the Board of Directors ensures that the selection of agenda items and the establishment of annual themes are scrutinized, that sufficient time is also spent to confirm the content of proposals presented to the Board of Directors, and that the Board of Directors Secretariat is instructed to explain the content of the proposals to each director in advance of meetings. Meetings of the Board of Directors are conducted in ways that enable directors, with their diverse backgrounds, to express their opinions on the basis of their varied knowledge.
As the director who leads the outside directors, the Chair of the Board of Directors serves as chair of the Outside Directors Meeting.
holds Outside Directors Meetings (with only outside directors in attendance) on a regular basis. These meetings provide outside directors with valuable opportunities to interact, communicate at a deeper level, and make discussions at gatherings of the Board of Directors, etc., more dynamic. At Outside Directors Meetings, participants freely discuss corporate governance- and business-related matters. If necessary, the Chair of the Board of Directors submits notifications, reports, and requests to the Board of Directors and operational divisions.
In FY2016, the Outside Directors Meeting discussed how to share information related to the succession plan, etc., and preparation for unexpected events. As a result, in April 2017, rules regarding the consideration of a succession plan were established, with the unanimous support of the directors.
Since FY2017, in accordance with these rules, the Outside Directors Meeting has met regularly, with all directors, including inside directors, in attendance, to share information and discuss succession plans proposed by the Representative Corporate Officer and CEO.
The effectiveness of the Board of Directors’ management oversight function is evaluated each year at the Outside Directors Meeting. If any issues related to the operation of the Board of Directors, etc., are identified, a request and proposal for improvement is submitted to the Board of Directors and operational divisions. In the corporate governance evaluation, the status of the activities of the Board of Directors, etc., is inspected and evaluated based on the corporate governance evaluation carried out in the previous fiscal year, issues are identified for the next fiscal year, and improvement measures are shown, thereby driving the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle.
Beginning in FY2017, we have had an outside organization review our processes and results once every 3 years to ensure the appropriateness and suitability of continued, regular corporate governance evaluations.
Up to this point as well, has conducted meetings between institutional investors and outside directors in Japan and overseas. In FY2017, outside directors visited multiple institutional investors, providing explanations of Eisai’s efforts regarding governance and the activities of the Independent Committee of Outside Directors related to the Policy for Protection of Eisai’s Corporate Value and Common Interests of Shareholders, and taking the opportunity to exchange opinions.
Compliance with the Corporate Governance Code
ensures full compliance with all 73 principles of the Corporate Governance Code adopted by the Tokyo Stock Exchange in June 2015. The eleven principles that require the disclosure of information are detailed in the Corporate Governance Report. In addition, the Corporate Governance Report discloses the Company's audit system, compensation for directors and corporate officers (e.g. procedure for determining the compensation calculation method), internal control system and requirements concerning the independence and neutrality of outside directors.This website is for shareholders, investors, and members of the media.

designates a Chief Compliance Officer, who is also the corporate officer responsible for internal control, to supervise the Corporate Compliance and Risk Management Department and promote compliance and risk management. defines compliance as “the observance of the highest legal and ethical standards” and positions it at the core of management activities.
implements its compliance program that consists of delivering the message of top management, developing the Code of Conduct and other relevant rules, conducting educational activities, establishing a training system as well as providing consultation services.
In risk management, defines risk as “the threat or probability that an action or event, will adversely affect the achievement of corporate and/or organizational objectives.” To contain risks within acceptable levels, is carrying out various initiatives including establishing, developing and implementing internal control systems as well as conducting internal audits.
The Corporate Compliance and Risk Management Department works with compliance departments and compliance personnel in each region to promote compliance globally. These compliance promotion activities periodically undergo objective reviews by a Compliance Committee that consists of external experts such as lawyers and consultants from Japan and overseas. Furthermore, the Compliance Committee provides advice and recommendations to the Chief Compliance Officer.
1. Establishment of Code of Conduct and Other Relevant Rules and Conducting Educational Activities to Foster Compliance Awareness
believes that fostering compliance awareness in all officers and employees is essential for ensuring that each officer and employee always engages in corporate activities based on compliance.
For this reason, created a Compliance Handbook, which outlines Network Companies (ENW) Charter of Business Conduct and the Code of Conduct. The handbook is available in 17 languages, and is distributed to all officers and employees in all network companies. In addition, all officers and employees declare every year that they understand and abide by the contents of the Compliance Handbook.
Furthermore, a “Code of Conduct for Business Partners,” which covers the behavior expected from all business partners and employees, was issued and rolled out globally in fiscal 2017.
has also created a Compliance Card that contains the contact information for the Compliance Counter and shared it with all officers and employees in network companies in Japan.
continues to conduct training through various means such as compliance workshops (including those designed for directors and officers), e-learning and distribution of case studies in order to foster compliance awareness.
The Compliance Counter serves as a point of contact for the whistle-blowing system in network companies and is set up globally across Japan, the U.S., Europe, China, Asia and other countries.

By using this system, we have already achieved certain results in reducing risk associated with new business transactions. Based on the thinking of a risk-based approach, this system is being operated in the Americas region that includes MexiBrazil and Canada; the region that encompasses Russia and Eastern Europe; China, India, and countries in Asia.

1. Promoting a Risk Management System and Response to Risks
Of all the risks identified by corporate officers and department managers through Control Self-Assessment (CSA), critical risks are uniformly managed by the Risk Management Committee.
Also, quickly detects its own potential risks through continuous monitoring for external corporate misconduct and prevents these risks from occurring by promptly responding to risks.
The identified risks are evaluated in terms of the degree of impact based on the magnitude of the inherent risk (impact and likelihood of occurrence) and the level of internal control (status of establishment, development and implementation).
The priority level of risk response is then determined and risk management is efficiently undertaken.
Eisai's Risk Management System
One of the tools used by for risk management is is conducted yearly for all department managers in network companies to identify and evaluate risk in their own structure. Identified risks are dealt with through workshops and others. In addition, ensures the effectiveness of risk management by identifying critical company-wide risk through interviews and submitting reports to corporate officers and by following up on the implementation of risk response by corporate officers.
Internal audits are voluntary audits that differ from the audits conducted by the Audit Committee and the accounting audits. The Corporate Internal Audit Department is established under the corporate officer responsible for internal control. While implementing internal audits globally, the department cooperates with internal audit departments in Japan, the U.S., Europe, China and Asia. These internal audits independently and objectively assess whether the execution of duties by corporate officers is being undertaken appropriately and efficiently. The results are reported to the Executive Committee and to the Audit Committee.
To assure high-quality audits that conform to global standards, the Corporate Internal Audit Department undergoes an assessment every year by an external assessment committee composed of outside experts in accordance with the standards of The Institute of Internal Auditors (an international professional association for internal auditors based in the U.S.).
