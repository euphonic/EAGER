Modules are Plug-and-Play, making them ideal for integration. Compact and protected, they are easily mountable. The integrated current driver and thermo-electric cooler are operable with customer-supply of 5 Volts.
Inphenix’s Driver Boards offer stable power and low noise for constant current control and on-off modulation. Inphenix’s Driver Boards are optimized to drive Inphenix’s Superluminescent Diodes and Semiconductor Optical Amplifiers and are available in stand-alone models or integrated with our modules.
offers Fabry-Perot Laser chips optimised for Optical Transmission, Data Communication, Local Optical Network and Fiber to the Home (FTTH) applications. Also, offers single-mode Distributed Feedback (DFB) lasers with high side-mode suppresion ratio and temperature controlled wavelength stability, which are designed and optimized for different sensor applications. In addition, 820nm, 1310nm and 1550nm Gain Chips can be used as a gain medium for Single Lasers or Externally Tunable Cavity Lasers.
Superluminescent Diodes
Inphenix’s Superluminescent Diodes combine very broad spectral bandwidths with high output power to deliver speckle-free emission wavelengths from 700nm to 1700nm. Superluminescent diode (SLD) is an edge-emitting semiconductor light source. The unique property of an is its high output power and low beam divergence, similar to an injection laser diode (LD), but with a broad emission spectrum and low coherence, similar to a light emitting diode (LED). SLDs are similar in geometry to lasers but have no built-in optical feedback mechanism required by LDs for stimulated emission to achieve lasing.
Inphenix’s Swept Light Sources offer deep penetration, long coherence length and high resolution. Based on Inphenix’s leading Semiconductor Optical Amplifier technology, Inphenix’s frequency swept tunable laser is specifically designed for Swept Source Optical Coherence Tomography (SS-OCT) and Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR) applications.
