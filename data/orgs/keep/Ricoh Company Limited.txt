Oji Plant, the main factory of Riken Optical for manufacturing sensitized paper as well as cameras and binoculars               (1938)
Founder Kiyoshi Ichimura
Ricoh’s origins date back to a decision by the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research to commercialize the              fruits of its R&by setting up Rikagaku Kogyo. Since its formation in 1927, the business venture has placed              on the market numerous products developed by the research institute, including sensitized paper. On February              6, 1936, the sensitized paper division was split off to be established as Riken Kankoshi Co., Ltd., a precursor              of Ricoh, under the directorship of Kiyoshi Ichimura (1900-1968). As the founder of Ricoh, Ichimura led the              successful development of the business that started with 350,000 yen in capital and a staff of 33.
Kiyoshi Ichimura formulated The Spirit of Three Loves: “ Love your neighbor,” “ Love your country,” “Love your              work,” and ever since, they have been respected as the Group’s Founding Principles, which provide every              employee with a guide for business and encourage individuals to constantly improve and contribute to the wellbeing              of all stakeholders, including families, customers, and society at large.

was the first in Japan to introduce a belt-conveyor system for manufacturing cameras, achieving              a production capacity of 10,000 units/month—more than ten times the capacity of the then standard level of less              than 1,000 units/month from the conventional handicraft industry. Successfully adopting this method of camera              mass production, offered the Ricohflex Model at an affordable price, which was remarkably low for              an iconic luxury item in those days. This model became highly popular among Japanese consumers, reportedly representing              more than 50% of total national camera production during its sales peak.

The product became widely popular in the late              1950s, sparking the coining of the term “make a Ricopy,” meaning to “make a copy” in Japan, a representation              of the brand that came to be recognized as being synonymous with the concept of duplication. Ricopy 101 and              the following desktop diazo-wet copier Ricopy series brought about a revolutionary improvement in office work              efficiency, ushering in an age of office automation. The model received the Mechanical Engineering Heritage              Certification No.54 for fiscal year 2012.

is a leading pioneer in the field of automatic camera technologies. In 1960 it released Auto 35,              the first electric-eye camera developed by a Japanese company; and then in 1962, rolled out the more advanced              and handy Auto Half—a half-frame, fully automatic camera with automated exposure, focusing and film-winding              functions. Being compact, purse-sized and requiring no manual control skills, the world’s smallest popular-model              automatic camera of the times proved to be a huge hit, particularly with female consumers.
Introduction of Ricoh’s corporate logo in 1963
Since being renamed Riken Optical Co., Ltd. in 1938 to represent its diversified business more accurately, the              corporate name remained unchanged for a quarter century until April 1963 when the present name, Company,              Ltd., was adopted in recognition of the reaching the key milestone of 10 billion yen in sales in the              early 1960s.

Employing a fixed-platen structure, which marked the world’s first desktop              copier to adopt that assembly, the product featured increased availability in terms of type of subject to be              copied, covering not only paper sheets but also almost everything from books, textiles, jewelry, and machine              parts to kitchen utensils. Ricopy BS-1 was viewed as a forerunner in an age when technological progress enabled              the “duplication of anything you like,” while serving as a driving force for Ricoh’s global business development.

was a pioneer in the field of office computer development that saw rapid growth in Japan in the 1970s.              This is illustrated by the 1971 introduction of the 8, the company’s first office computer, which was              developed jointly with The embedded magnetic core memory with a 2/4 kilobyte capacity and 64-bit demonstrated              exceptional (at that time) storage capability and high-speed performance. The product was also highly regarded              for its space- saving tower-structure design.

The product was also capable of international transmission. At the product launch              conference held in April 1973, a transmission demonstration was successfully conducted between Tokyo and New              York via satellite communications, establishing the global reputation of as a leading technology brand.              This machine was included in the Essential Historical Materials for Science and Technology list (No.00170) for              fiscal 2014.

New series highly evaluated for its quality performance (1975)
Company-led rally held at Atsugi Plant to increase production of the new DT1200 in October, 1975
The new DT1200 was developed to satisfy the ever-higher expectations of users for plain-paper copiers              (PPCs) at that time. We offered this model with confidence as a reflection of its strong features, namely, a              single touch switch between two different paper size feeders, marking the first time that such a function had              ever been employed for popular model PPCs; a liquid development method employed to consume the entire supply              of toner loaded in the machine; and stable functionality for quality results, proven even with one million pages              running consecutively, thus reducing the amount of required maintenance work. These superior specifications              were highly regarded by many users, particularly in the USA, where in general, availability of maintenance service              was geographically limited. In 1991, the DT1200 was enshrined in the nation’s Copier Hall of Fame to              acknowledge the significant role the product played in the history of wet-type copier development.

In November 1971, introduced a total quality control (TQC) campaign, aiming to build a recession-proof              robust corporate structure. We began to conduct various activities throughout the to improve its              management systems, setting as the goal the winning of the Deming Prize, the world’s top quality control award.              As a result of consistent efforts over the ensuing 46 months, on November 17, 1975, became the first office              machine manufacturer to receive the Deming Prize. This recognition served to verify our successful structural              reform directed at growth in the coming era.

introduces the FT4060, the first dry-toner plain-paper copier
The FT4000 series won a gold award at the international trade fair in Bulgaria in September, 1983
The FT4060, an A3-page plain-paper copier (PPC) complete with a zoom feature, enjoyed phenomenal market              success, with a total of 100,000 units sold in 10 months from its release. Keys to this success were the model’s              high definition quality, operational durability and compact body. These properties were achieved through an              effective combination of a newly developed electrophotographic imaging system and many other technologies related              to mechanism and supply items, including toner. Also, with increased availability for paper type and size, this              innovative model contributed considerably to raising the efficiency of duplication work in offices.

Community Plaza on the first floor of the Research and Development Center
Research and Development Center was founded as one of the commemorative events of the company’s 50th anniversary.              It was set up to become the core function of the company’s multi-lab project to enhance its system for comprehensive              R&activities from the long-term perspective. The center opened on April 23, 1986 within the Kohoku New Town              district in Yokohama. The facilities cover a total area of 16,700㎡ and include not only a range of laboratories              for precision measurement and analysis as well as clean rooms, but also spaces designed to encourage researchers’              inventive efforts and interactions. The establishment serves as Ricoh’s key R&base that undertakes a full              range of activities, from basic and applied studies to commercial use research.
Before the 320 was launched, the commercial photocopier market was dominated by monochrome analog models,              with digital models marginalized due to unaffordable unit prices (exceeding 2 million yen on average) and extremely              large sizes that prevented their installation in standard offices. To overcome these challenges, developed              the 320, a more compact and affordable digital copier for office use. We reduced the body dimensions              to a practical size and brought the price down to below 1 million yen. In addition, we incorporated multiple              advanced features into the model, including functions to reproduce unprecedented image quality, an extensive              image editor selection, automatic control, and multifunctionality to enable operational interaction with other              office equipment. Being more practical, sophisticated and less costly, the product sold well over 20,000 units              in its first 12 months, making it a massive hit.

On September 19, 1989, signed an agreement to become the 1992 Barcelona Olympics Worldwide Sponsor in the              facsimile category. Based on this agreement, the constructed the Olympic Fax Network to connect the              International Olympic Committee (IOC) to around 40 related sports associations in 167 countries. This worldwide              network greatly enhanced international communication among the organizations involved, which previously had              to rely on postal and telex systems to exchange messages. Through this project, we were able to contribute considerably              to a more accurate, speedy and smoother Olympic Games.
Introduces 8000, Ricoh’s first digital color copier
Foursome drive developed by Ricoh, adopting a “one-scan, four-beam, four drum tandem” system
The standard technology adopted for color copiers around 1990 required repeated imaging processing for four colors              (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) loaded on a single drum to reproduce one color copy. This was a time-consuming              process, taking about five minutes on average to make one A4-page copy. Identifying an opportunity in this limitation,              developed a four-drum photoreceptor system that could process the four colors in tandem, which was a vital              function built into the new digital color model. The resulting 8000 boasted the capability of an outstanding              high-speed color printing output of 15 ppm, which was the world’s fastest at that time. The product was also              designed to accept various paper types. The introduction of 8000 increased the availability of the color              duplication option in routine office operations.

Photocopier designed for easier disassembly and component sorting
Spirio 2700, recyclable design model that has adopted a number of measures to improve efficiency in the recycling               process, such as a reduced number of screws, unified plastic materials, and compatible decal labels developed               to eliminate the need for removal
Recycling centers were built in the Kanto and Kyushu regions for disassembling and sorting components of collected               used copiers as a part of efforts for energy reduction and recycling
In the early 1990s, began to promote sustainable environmental management on a full scale, implementing              a variety of activities. One of the key initiatives was the introduction of a recyclable product design. For              copy machines, around 20% of the weight of an entire unit is composed of plastic parts, which previously did              not undergo disassembly and sorting for reuse since used units were wholly destroyed and disposed of. In 1993,              in order to reduce this waste by improving the parts recycling rate, we formulated a recyclable design policy              and product assessment system. Our first recyclable design copier was released in 1994. These efforts won public              recognition, including the highest prize from the Minister of International Trade and Industry for environmental              activities for product assessment and recyclable design in the recycling project award hosted by the Clean Japan              Center in 1995. The recyclable design initiative took root in as a continual driver of its sustainable
Compact and lightweight body achieved through functional integration
DC-1, which employed Ricoh’s proprietary image processing technology that had been developed primarily              for office automation systems to achieve integrated processing of image and non-image data, pioneered a new              front in the digital camera market. This pioneering model featured a handy pocket-size body that housed a set              of then leading-edge functions (that have now become standard) such as zoom, data communication, and video recording              with sound. Also, to offer the option of data transfer to PCs, necessary applications and image recording media were developed to specifically serve the purpose of this model.
imagio MF200, a global digital copier success story (1996)
The imagio MF200 realized the turning point in the history of copy machines by sparking the dramatic transition              from analog to digital models. It featured digital-enabled high-definition quality, memory for storing data              to be copied, a compact body (for an A3-paper support model) with the world’s smallest width at that time as              well as lower unit prices achieved through rigorous cost cutting efforts. Because of all these outstanding features,              the imagio MF200 was particularly popular with smaller corporate users, enjoying enormous sales and becoming              a record-breaking hit. Following the rollout of this machine, the digital segment increased to exceed the analog              segment in terms of shipment volume in the Japanese market. In the global copier sector, this event provided              momentum supporting the trend toward the shift to digital technologies on a large scale.

Imagine the year 2036
There are still many problems to be solved around workers, society and social interaction. We are constantly thinking about people and how to help them work more creatively for a more satisfying life.
Ricoh's Current Initiatives

Refine Manufacturing Retail Healthcare Real Estate Travel and Tourism Engineering and Construction All Industries
In 2017, the group created a new brand promise for our customers: “WORKPLACES”.
Empowering Digital Workplaces means connecting people to information faster and more conveniently to improve communication and creativity.
This is based on the “San-Ai Spirit” - The Spirit of Three Loves: Love your neighbor, Love your country, Love your work - which the has followed since it was established in 1936.
At we are constantly thinking about people and how to help them work more creatively for a more satisfying life.
The first Japanese copy machine transformed the workplace by helping people to transmit information accurately and quickly without the time-wasting and life-sapping tedium of endlessly reproducing business documents.
The first fax machine enabled the transmission of information to extend beyond mere hand-to-hand delivery to cross cities, countries, and the world in seconds and connect people everywhere.
These breakthroughs were the birth of what we now call “office automation”. This evolved from simple document creation, duplication, and delivery to changing the entire workflow with copying, printing, information communication, storage and search, and an endless series of workplace innovations.
As times changed, technology advanced. But there are still many problems to be solved around workers, society and social interaction. will provide more solutions with “WORKPLACES”.
Printing beyond printing
What will the role of printing be in the future?
We are considering how to bring printing deep into people’s lives.
We see the possibility of digital printing that can inspire the power
of the human imagination, help fulfill people’s dreams
and solve many of the world’s problems.
Today, we are giving communication a new value not
just on paper, but on all kinds of mediums such as fabrics,
building materials and even food.
We are moving people’s minds by this “display printing.”
Now we can even achieve digital printing that forms cells,
medicines and battery parts.
This "applied printing” has powerful life-changing effects.
At we create printing that relates to all our lives,
and by using our digital technology we are already delivering
a more abundant future for everyone.
New digital possibilities for business and society
Even if digital is advanced in your workplace,
it is meaningless if you can’t make the most of its advantages.
Data only becomes valuable information when it touches “human emotions”:
for example, by connecting offices and frontlines by digitizing workflows and communications
and reforming the entire work process.
And also by storing conversations and movements in the workplace
and transforming them into visible information that everyone can see.
is now opening the door to new ways to connect workers and information,
that shed light on the possibilities that are hidden in every business field and society
and opening eyes and minds to improvements in workflow and communication.
This leads to greater collaboration and solutions to social challenges.
We support a new style of “working” by “giving shape to new digital possibilities for future”.
Connecting for Sustainability
～Driving Sustainability for Our Future～
By connecting workers and information, we create workplace solutions that, in turn, resolve social challenges.
We help to realize the prosperity of companies and enhance society at the same time.
Based on this approach since was founded in 1936, we, along with all our group employees, have always taken on challenging tasks that are ahead of their time.
This has formed our concept to balance the relationship between the economy (Prosperity), society (People) and the environment (the Planet). We call this the “Three Ps Balance”.
In 2017, we decided to tackle five key issues based on the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): “Productivity Enhancement”, “Intelligence Creation”, “Enhancement”, “Zero-carbon Society”, and a “Circular Economy”.
The Group will connect all the solutions we are striving to develop by  everywhere, to create a truly sustainable society.To view this website correctly, please ensure you have

The Group will accelerate innovation through agile technology development.
Tadashi Furushima,
Corporate Vice Presidents
With advancements in innovation across all sectors globally, it is becoming increasingly important to develop technologies that are able to resolve issues facing customers and society at large quickly.
The Group is now working to create new value using its core technologies, nurtured over many years, including its printing technology. has evolved its printing technology from display printing on materials such as paper, fabric, film, building materials, and décor, to applied printing using innovative materials for devices/modules and bio 3printing. These developments allow to tackle complex social issues, which is already showing some positive results.
Moreover, through the combination of our smart edge devices and Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Group is focusing efforts on the creation of workplaces that add value, whether in an office, on the factory floor, or further afield across society.
Innovation is essential for the rapid realization of these initiatives. The Group actively promotes cooperation and collaboration with universities, research institutes, and companies, including venture businesses, demonstrating Ricoh's commitment to dynamically breaking through existing frameworks and accepted practices.
As supporters of innovation, the Group remains committed to “WORKPLACES” by seizing the opportunity to deliver technologies that the customer desires and that society requires.
