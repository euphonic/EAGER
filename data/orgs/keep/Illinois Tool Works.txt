In late 2012, we launched our Enterprise Strategy with the explicit goal of positioning to deliver solid growth with best-in-class margins and returns by focusing the entire company on utilizing ITW’s highly differentiated and proprietary Business Model to its full potential.
The Business Model is the core source of our competitive advantage as a company. It drives our ability to win with customers and deliver differentiated returns for our shareholders.
We implemented several key initiatives in conjunction with our Enterprise Strategy and we have made significant progress over the course of the last five years. This work included portfolio realignment, business structure simplification, strategic sourcing, and diligent re-application of ITW’s 80/20 Front to Back Process.
Since launching our Enterprise Strategy in 2012, we have increased ITW’s operating margin from 15.9% to 24.4% and after-tax return on invested capital from 14.5% to 24.4%. We have grown earnings per share at better than 16% annually over the prior five-year period, and the company’s market capitalization has more than doubled.
Moving forward, we remain committed to the four strategic principles that have served as the foundation of our progress over the past five years, and that we believe best position to deliver continued differentiated performance over the next five years.
Business Model is Our Competitive Advantage
The Business Model is a proprietary combination of strategic, operational, and cultural approaches and practices that we apply to every business.  The Business Model was developed, and has been constantly evolving inside for over 30 years, and is comprised of three elements:
■ 80/20 Front to Back Process = How We Operate
■ Customer-Back Innovation approach = How We Innovate
■ Decentralized Entrepreneurial Culture = How We Execute
To leverage the Business Model to its full potential, we continue to strive for excellence in the practice of the Business Model everywhere in the company, every day.  Our goal from its application is to generate solid growth with best in class margins and returns in every industry in which we operate.
We Focus on Quality Growth
We prioritize high quality revenue growth and, as such, our primary growth focus is organic.
We leverage our business model and our 80/20 Front to Back Process to provide a clear view of where to focus for high quality growth.  We target differentiated end-markets and customers with critical needs and challenging pain points.  We generate high-quality growth through consistent customer-back innovation and customer service excellence.
We only invest and operate in industries and businesses that have the right “raw material” to generate high quality organic growth through the application of the Business Model. Our current portfolio of seven segments offers solid growth potential and a high degree of diversification in terms of geographic and end market exposures, enabling us to deliver consistent high-quality growth in an intensely competitive and increasingly volatile global environment.
“Do What We Say” Execution is a Critical Differentiator
Our commitment to execution is a key differentiator for Living up to our commitments – “do what we say” execution – is a deeply embedded core element of our culture.  Our culture is the engine that translates ITW’s strategy into action and action into results.
All divisions function within a “framework” that defines how our culture operates and defines our values, our business model, and our strategy to ensure all divisions are working toward a common set of goals. Our business leaders have the flexibility to define the actions and customize their approach to meet those goals. This “flexibility within the framework” establishes an entrepreneurial environment where decisions are made “bottom up” by those with the greatest knowledge, capability and proximity to the customer, which enables our business to be nimble and react quickly to market conditions and customer requirements.
We are simple, straightforward and transparent in everything we do.  We set clear performance expectations and financial targets, we execute against these at the appropriate pace, and we establish the freedom to define how to achieve results within the construct of our Business Model.
Invest Only Where We Have a Competitive Advantage
We are highly focused in our approach to investing only where we can leverage the Business Model into compelling and sustainable competitive advantage.
Investments to support organic growth and sustain our highly differentiated core businesses, such as new product innovation, marketing programs, simplification projects, and capital investments, are our number one investment priority.
Our strategy is to leverage the full potential of the Business Model to generate solid growth with best-in-class margins and returns. With this objective firmly in mind, we are committed to achieving our performance goals for 2018 to 2022.

safer, cleaner way to fuel vehicles
What began as a plastic fastener spin-off at Fastex — just two desks in the corner of their accounting department — is now an industry leading developer and manufacturer of molded products for automotive applications. Deltar has not looked back, continuing to create products that solve customers’ problems. Instead of simply turning out commodities, the focus has been on finding the next solution for customer needs.
The latest in Deltar’s string of innovations is the capless refueling system, which garnered a Chicago Innovation Award. Like many of Deltar’s innovations, the system has created a new standard in auto manufacturing. This break-through system reduces evaporative emissions at the pump. Not only is it better for air quality, it’s also better for users: no more gas odor on the hands. Since there is no cap, users will not lose the cap, forget it at the gas station, or drop the cap and watch it roll under the vehicle. No dangling cap means fewer paint scratches and the unique design of the fuel filler reduces the chance of gas siphoning. For people with arthritis or other impairments, capless fuel filling brings welcome relief from the awkward or painful twisting to unscrew the cap.

For over a century improvements, especially automation, have revolutionized the modern food and hospitality industry. However, today’s customers want more
especially greater sustainability and higher energy efficiency. The innovators at Hobart have answered the call with the most energy- and water-efficient conveyor-type commercial dishwasher yet.
The Advansys™ CLewarewasher combines new Energy Recovery technology with exclusive Opti-Rinse™ for a combined energy and water savings of more than $11,000 a year. The Energy Recovery system harnesses existing heat: the heat energy already generated by the machine is recycled to preheat the incoming water supply. The system uses automatic timers and cool water finishing rinses supplied through the Energy Recovery System to further save energy. Opti-Rinse technology creates a powerful spray forming an S-shaped pattern across the surface of the ware, lowering the water and energy use by 50 percent. Opti-Rinse also reduces the size of the booster heater required. More completely sanitized, sparkling clean dishes; more savings. Less energy usage; less water usage. Advanced technology that benefits customers and the environment.

The Business Model is a unique and proprietary combination of strategic, operational, and cultural practices that we apply across the company. The Model is comprised of three elements:
80/20 Front to Back Process = How We Operate
We structure and focus our businesses to uniquely satisfy the needs of our largest and most profitable customers, and minimize the cost, complexity and distractions associated with serving small customers. The application of our 80/20 Front-to-Back process drives best-in-class customer facing execution, high quality organic growth and superior profitability performance per dollar of revenue generated, and per dollar of capital deployed.
Customer-Back Innovation approach = How We Innovate
Customer-back Innovation enables our businesses to deliver a steady flow of differentiated new products and solutions to their "80" customers. In every market in which we operate, our businesses work hard to position themselves as the go-to problem solver for these customers. Customer-back innovation is a key contributor to ITW's ability to deliver consistent above-market organic growth.
Decentralized Entrepreneurial Culture = How We Execute
Our culture is the engine that drives the highly efficient conversion of strategy into action and action into results.
"SAY" DIFFERENTIATOR
Our commitment to execution is a key differentiator for Living up to our commitments – our "do what we say" execution – is deeply embedded in our culture.  At ITW, our culture is the engine that translates ITW's strategy into action and action into results.
We work hard to ensure that our leaders across the company are clear about the "Framework," which defines our expectations and goals regarding our values, our business model, and our strategy.  Aligning with this framework ensures that all divisions are working toward a common set of goals, which are consistent with overall company performance expectations.
Our business leaders decide how best to apply our business model, execute our strategy, and contribute to our performance goals in the context of their businesses' unique characteristics and opportunities. This "flexibility within the framework" establishes an entrepreneurial environment where decisions are made "bottom up" by those with the greatest knowledge, capability and proximity to the customer, which enables our businesses to be nimble and react quickly to market conditions and customer requirements.
key priority in our Phase 1 (2012-2017) strategy was to shift our primary growth focus from acquisition to organic growth on the basis that organic is the only sustainable form of high-quality revenue growth for a company of ITW's size and scale. In this regard, we leverage our Business Model and our 80/20 Front to Back process to provide a clear view of where to focus for high quality growth.  We target differentiated end-markets and customers with critical needs and challenging pain points.  We generate high-quality growth through consistent customer-back innovation and customer service excellence.
We only invest and operate in industries and businesses that have the right "raw material" to generate high quality organic growth through the application of the Business Model. Our current portfolio of seven segments offers solid growth potential and a high degree of diversification in terms of geographic and end market exposures, enabling us to deliver consistent high-quality growth in an intensely competitive and increasingly volatile global environment.
We are highly focused in our approach to investing only where we can leverage the Business Model to create compelling and enduring competitive advantage and deliver differentiated financial performance.
Our capital allocation strategy is underpinned by our Business Model, a long track record of generating a significant cash flow, and a very strong balance sheet. Our top priority is to reinvest in the company, in support of organic growth and sustaining our core businesses.  Our second priority is an attractive dividend.  We raised the target payout ratio from 43% to 50% in August 2018.  Finally, we prioritize investments in acquisitions that expand our long-term organic growth potential, and/or in an active share repurchase program.
