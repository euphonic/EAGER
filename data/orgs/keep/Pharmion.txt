The Company’s commitment to changing the course of human health through bold pursuits in science, life-enhancing therapies and a promise to always put patients first.
Challenges arise on the job every day for Jessica Cybrowski, an executive specialist at 
 in Berkeley Heights, She helps patients navigate the challenges of insurance and Medicare coverage to ensure they have access to the medicine they need. Over her years with the company, Jessica has been able to help countless patients access their medications. “have expertise that is practical and real,” she said. “My team and are helping them fight cancer. What could be more rewarding than that?”
From helping people obtain their medications to using cutting-edge scientific technology to discover new treatments, Celgene’s entrepreneurial spirit, teamwork-oriented culture and commitment to rare diseases create a unique platform for transforming patient outcomes. At every level, it is growing and evolving. 
Passion, innovation and courage have been in the company’s genes since its founding. “Our journey to a successful company included unexpected road blocks, the courage of our people to convert those road blocks into opportunities and seize them, the vision to not only overcome obstacles but to transform them into novel approaches and progress,” former Chairman & Sol Barer, Phsaid. On those principles, Celgene has become a leader in delivering medicine to 
 with unmet needs, by digging deeper to resolve unanswered scientific questions and working tirelessly to improve the lives of patients worldwide.
, and taking a unique perspective, Celgene has been able to offer patients options that can enhance their quality of life. Perhaps the ultimate example of their boldness was bringing thalidomide to market for patients with serious rare diseases who had few treatment choices. With persistence and creativity, Celgene was able to transform this maligned drug into new hope for cancer patients in need.
Whether it’s working to deliver innovative therapies to emerging markets that lack proper infrastructure or doggedly pursuing regulatory approvals to bring new options to treat rare diseases, Celgene employees are committed to putting patients first
Joel Beetsch, vice president of Patient Advocacy, has been impressed by the openness of the company and how the typical limitations of red tape in larger organizations don’t tend to apply at Celgene. “It’s a make-it-happen culture,” he said.
Whether it’s working to deliver innovative therapies to emerging markets that lack proper infrastructure or doggedly pursuing regulatory approvals to bring new options to treat rare diseases, Celgene employees are committed to putting patients first. If an obstacle arises, colleagues work together to brainstorm and figure out a solution to the issue. And they also take time to celebrate successes. “Everyone at Celgene shares a common focus: helping patients get the medication their prescriber thinks will improve or maintain their quality of life,” Jessica said. “We know that each of us contributes to helping a patient get what they need in some way or another. It’s a very unifying mission, which is rewarding in itself.”
Celgene employees also reach out to their 
 off the clock. One employee with a friend in need of a bone marrow transplant established a bone marrow registry within a couple weeks. And just last year, employees exceeded their fundraising goal for The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society’s “
” event by 247 percent. They’ve also run collections for breast cancer research and have donated money for tsunami relief efforts.
Community dedication especially shined following Hurricane Sandy, which devastated much of the east coast, including parts of New Jersey, surrounding the Celgene Summit headquarters. Hundreds of Celgene employees worked to maintain continuity of services to patients, even while their own homes were damaged and their families were without electricity. They demonstrated resiliency and tenacity so that patients both locally and worldwide did not have a disruption in their access to critical therapies.
 based on integrity, ethics, sound decision making, respect for the environment and behaviors that reflect its corporate culture. They have expanded efforts with the aim of continuous improvement of environmental, social and economic performance. These efforts include new methods for patient support and advocacy, personnel interactions with corporate leadership and support for new programs in local communities.
For Axelle Beauchamp, a senior manager of Human Resources in Boudry, Switzerland, the creative employees who collaborate toward a common goal are the critical Celgene elements—the genes that make up the company. “People are very talented, motivated, and driven to think outside the box and make a difference,” she said. “Everyone is engaged because they believe in the mission. Having the same values, they excel in delivering results.”
The story of Celgene encompasses unexpected opportunities, the courage to seize those opportunities, and the vision to transform those opportunities into progress. Ultimately, Celgene hopes to turn some of the most formidable disease challenges of the 21

What is it that defines Celgene? Is it our unique products and our innovative approach to treating disease? Is it our cutting-edge research addressing a broad range of conditions? Our growing reputation as an important contributor to medical progress? Our commitment to healthcare providers and compassion for their patients? While each of these factors contributes in significant ways to what Celgene is, they represent only part of the story.
Most fundamentally, Celgene is its employees, who are focused on the single mission of delivering innovative therapies to patients with unmet medical needs in cancer and inflammatory diseases. They are a varied group of talented people, including Ph.bench scientists, sales representatives, manufacturing engineers, information technology professionals, clinical research physicians, lab technicians, marketing professionals, regulatory experts, accounting and finance personnel, clinical coordinators, senior executives, human resource managers, nurses and pharmacists.
As different as each of these positions and the individuals who hold them are, they are united in their commitment to discover, develop and market life-enhancing drugs that make a measurable difference in the lives of millions of people. Our employees are in the right place, at the right time, doing the right things, to build on the Company’s scientific and commercial achievements.
Celgene has been fortunate to attract employees of the highest caliber since its earliest days. More recently, as our rapid commercial growth has required the acquisition of specialized skills, we have benefited from the increased availability of highly trained and qualified individuals as a result of consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry. We are gratified that these individuals have decided to build their careers at Celgene.
We believe that our ongoing success will enable us to maintain this extraordinary level of commitment and to continue to attract the best people at every level of the organization.

Beginning August 1, 2013, the Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the “Sunshine Act”), which is part of the Affordable Care Act, requires manufacturers of drugs, medical devices, and biologicals that participate in federal health care programs to track and then report certain payments and items of value given to physicians and teaching hospitals (defined as “Covered Recipients”).
The Sunshine Act requires that manufacturers collect this information on a yearly basis and then report it to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) by the 90th day of each subsequent year. On June 30th of each year, plans to post the reported payments and other transfers of value on its public website.
Manufacturers are required to report payments and transfers of value made to “Covered Recipients.” The term Covered Recipients refers to physicians and teaching hospitals.
The Sunshine Act defines a “physician” as any of the following types of professionals who are legally authorized to practice:
 included in the definition of Covered Recipients.
will annually publish a list of hospitals that meet the definition of a teaching hospital for Sunshine Act reporting purposes.
What are some examples of payments or transfers of value that the Sunshine Act requires manufacturers to report?
The Sunshine Act requires that manufacturers report payments and other transfers of value made to those parties that have been defined as Covered Recipients. This includes the cost of meals provided to physicians, as well as payments made to Covered Recipients in exchange for services provided, such as advisory boards, speaker programs, and consulting engagements. In addition to meals and payments, manufacturers will also have to report other transfers of value provided to Covered Recipients, including, but not limited to, travel and provision of reprints of medical journal articles to Covered Recipients.
Where and when will the reported information under the Sunshine Act be available?
annually publishes the information reported by manufacturers on its Open Payments website, 
Where can a physician or teaching hospital review payments and transfers of value that are attributed to them?
encourages physicians and teaching hospitals to register on 
 to review the reported payments and transfers of value attributed to them before public release of the data. On the site, physicians and teaching hospitals have an opportunity to dispute payments and transfers of value if they believe there are inaccuracies. The website has more information about the review and dispute process: http://www.cms.gov/OpenPayments/Program-Participants/Physicians-and-Teaching-Hospitals/Physicians-and-Teaching-Hospitals.html
If you are a physician or teaching hospital representative and have a question about a spend amount reported by Celgene, please submit your inquiry to 
No, the Sunshine Act does not replace state disclosure and transparency laws.
Celgene will follow Sunshine Act reporting guidelines with respect to the valuation and reporting of meals. For a meal that is not separately identifiable (for example, a deli platter) Celgene will calculate the “Per Person Value of the Meal” by dividing the entire cost of the meal by the total number of individuals who ate the meal (this includes physicians, nurses, office staff, etc.).
The “Per Person Value of the Meal” is reported as a transfer of value only to the physician(s) who ate the meal.
For example: catered lunch costing $165 is brought to a ten physician group practice. Six of the ten physicians and five non-physicians eat the meal. Because the meal costs $15 per participant ($165/11 participants = $15), a $15 meal is reported for each of the six physicians who ate it. However, the meal does not need to be reported for the four other physicians in the group who did not eat the meal or for the five non-physicians who did eat the meal.
Will meals provided to nurses and office staff be reported?
Under the Sunshine Act reporting guidelines, meals provided to nurses and office staff will not be reportable and will not be attributed to physicians. However, some state disclosure laws do require reporting of payments to a broader group of recipients, including non-physician prescribers, nurses and office staff.
For 2013, payments or other transfers of value from Celgene to a physician that are less than $10 will not be reported, unless the total aggregate amount of value Celgene transfers to the physician exceeds $100.  In 2014, the threshold amounts were updated to $10.18 and $101.75, respectively. The Open Payments reporting thresholds are adjusted annually based on the consumer price index.
On August 15, a physician eats one meal provided by Celgene valued at $8; on December 15,the same physician receives a $100 consulting fee from Celgene. The physician receives no other payments or transfers of value from or on behalf of Celgene for the  year. This results in two reportable transactions: an $8 food and beverage and a $100 consulting fee.
On August 15, a physician eats one meal provided by Celgene valued at $8; on December 15, the same physician receives an $80 consulting fee from Celgene. The physician receives no other payments or transfers of value from or on behalf of Celgene for the  year. This results in one reportable transaction: $80 consulting fee.
On August 15, a physician eats one meal provided by Celgene valued at $15; on December 15, the same physician receives an $80 consulting fee. The physician receives no other payments or transfers of value from or on behalf of Celgene for the  year. This results in two reportable transactions: $15 food and beverage and $80 consulting fee.
On August 15,a physician eats one meal provided by Celgene valued at $8; on December 15, the same physician eats one meal provided by Celgene valued at $7. The physician receives no other payments or transfers of value from or on behalf of Celgene for the  year. No transactions would be reportable for the physician.
If a physician directs Celgene to pay another entity instead of the physician, how will the transaction be reported?
The Sunshine Act requires that the payment be reported under the physician’s name and that the entity paid be listed as a third party recipient.
If a physician is paid by a third-party vendor, is that payment reportable under the Sunshine Act?
The Sunshine Act requires that manufacturers report both direct payments to physicians as well as payments made through a third party entity on Celgene’s behalf.
Are payments and transfers of value for international engagements reportable under the Sunshine Act?

Celgene is a company built on a foundation of bold innovation to address areas of significant need for patients with cancer and other debilitating diseases. This unyielding drive has led the company to developments that have transformed the care of diseases like multiple myeloma and pancreatic cancer and has provided important new options for patients with psoriatic diseases.
As the company has grown, so has its commitment to innovation. In fact, the company has increased its investment in research and development by more than 36 percent per year on average since 2006, when its lead therapy for multiple hematologic diseases was approved. During this time, the company also built what would be a defining part of its research efforts, the distributed research model.
By coupling Celgene’s internal research and traditional business development efforts with a program focused on identifying and nurturing disruptive science outside the company, Celgene was able to option promising candidates for rare and debilitating diseases. The program currently features more than 50 collaborations with 21 unique compounds in clinical development.
“We are focused on great science, first and foremost,” said Robert Hershberg, M.D., Ph.D., Celgene’s Executive Vice President and Head of Business Development and Global Alliances. “We seek in our partners what we seek in our own scientific and development teams. Notably, we seek passion, a commitment to excellence, and a strong desire to bring novel treatments to improve patients’ lives.”
“The distributed research model—in place at Celgene for almost a decade—recognizes and embraces the fact that contributions to progress in human health can be readily seen in academic institutions, private foundations, small and large biotechnology companies, and in the pharmaceutical sector,” he continued. “Importantly, no single institution, company or entity can do this alone and there is an increasing interdependence on a range of efforts to bring this promise to patients. We seek partners in our core areas of scientific interest (Protein Homeostasis, Immuno-Oncology, Epigenetics, Immunology/Inflammation, and Neuroscience) and clinical interest (Hematology, Oncology, Inflammatory diseases) and hope to identify programs in adjacent, novel areas as well.”
One of the keys to the growth of the programs was to identify and incentivize this innovation early on.
“As products increase in both their complexity and their precision, intense support early in the development process is critical. The establishment of relevant pre-clinical models and deep interrogation of novel pathways provide the appropriate roadmap for moving early science forward towards the clinic,” continued Hershberg. “In early studies of these novel therapies in patients, an intense focus on ‘translational’ medicine—developing tools to gather as much data as possible in early clinical trials. These early efforts both improve the likelihood of clinical success and can dramatically reduce the timelines required to bring novel therapies to patients that desperately need them.”
Along with groundbreaking research, these partnerships also provide the opportunity to learn critical lessons in discovery research through new platforms for Celgene, and a chance to advance programs alongside an industry veteran for the partner companies.
An important example of this was the partnership with Agios Pharmaceuticals, Inc . The long-term research partnership provided the opportunity to evaluate multiple programs, to adjust the terms to fit each company, and most importantly, to deliver the first FDA-approved product to come out of Celgene’s distributed research model.
“Close collaboration from the very start has been key to the success of our relationship with Celgene” said David Schenkein, M.D., Chief Executive Officer of Agios. “By focusing on each other’s strengths, we were able to pursue the science and develop a new medicine, less than four years from the first in human study to approval in a blood cancer that had not seen a new medicine in nearly 40 years.”
Hershberg has a unique perspective on partnering with Celgene as he has now served on both sides of the model, in his current role as head of the company’s business development efforts, and as a partner during his time as of VentiRx.
“Celgene has been on the leading edge of business development to engage external partners to extend our Research and Development footprint. Importantly, many of these partnerships allow and facilitate a partner’s ability to do what they do best—and to advance programs into early and mid-stage clinical development. The business structures are flexible and ideally designed to meet both Celgene’s and the partner’s unique needs,” said Hershberg.
Another long-term partner was recently in the news as well. Acceleron Pharma , alongside Celgene, announced top-line results from multiple pivotal studies of a collaboration that had been ongoing for more than ten years.
“Our collaboration is focused on developing and delivering transformational therapies to patients in areas of disease with few options,” said Habib Dable, President and Chief Executive Officer of Acceleron. “Because of our mutual commitment to this focus, we have advanced to the point where we are preparing for potential approval. Our shared experience has kept the combined team energized and on mission throughout.”
The close collaborations that make up Celgene’s distributed research model have bolstered a leading biopharmaceutical pipeline for Celgene, provided vital, early support for its partners’ promising programs and even delivered a new therapy to patients in need.
“The opportunity to partner early and leverage our research platform to identify potentially disruptive therapies has led to the opportunity to expand our collaboration twice already to encompass new targets and new areas of disease,” said Werner Lanthaler, Chief Executive Officer of Evotec “We believe our work together across these multiple platforms have the potential to make meaningful impacts on patients’ lives and we continue to partner closely to make this happen.”
Celgene will continue to look for transformational science both within and outside of its walls as it seeks to deliver on its mission to improve the lives of patients worldwide. Successful partnerships, like those it has fostered already, will be essential in that effort.

Celgene is committed to complying with all applicable laws, regulations and industry standards. Celgene has developed a Comprehensive Compliance Program in accordance with the Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers published by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General in April 2003 (Guidance) and which includes policies consistent with the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) Code on Interactions with Health Care Professionals (PhCode).
The Celgene Compliance Program includes numerous policies and procedures and is continually assessed and evaluated to ensure consistency with additional laws and guidance. It is designed to prevent, detect and remediate violations of law, regulations and company policies, as well as to promote an ethical culture that will, among other things, guide our interactions with healthcare professionals and healthcare entities. In the event that Celgene becomes aware of any potential or actual violations of policy or law, an investigation will be triggered and, if necessary, followed by appropriate remedial or corrective actions in accordance with the Celgene Compliance Program.
As part of the Compliance Program, Celgene has established a specific annual aggregate dollar limit of $1,500 on gifts, items or activities Celgene may give or otherwise provide to an individual medical or healthcare professional in California on an annual basis. This limit may be revised from time to time by Celgene in its sole discretion, in which case the revised limit will be published in this section of the Celgene website within a reasonable period of time following revision. This limit represents an expenditure cap and not a goal or an average expenditure amount. Historically, expenditures for such items have been substantially less than this limit for most healthcare professionals with whom Celgene interacts. The Company has established an internal monitoring system designed to help ensure compliance with the annual spending limits in California and is working to establish additional monitoring processes.
The annual limit does not include expenditures the following:
Drug samples given to physicians and healthcare professionals;
and Patient educational materials provided to patients by their physician with the purpose of educating the patient or enhancing the patient’s understanding or management of the condition
Based on a good faith understanding of the requirements of Section 119402 of the California Health & Safety Code, Celgene hereby declares that, to the best of its knowledge, its Comprehensive Compliance Program addresses the California statutory requirements for inclusion of policies addressing the Guidance and PhCode and limits on gifts and incentives to health professionals. Subject to the above, Celgene also hereby declares that it is, in all material respects, in compliance with its Comprehensive Compliance Program as of June 30, 2018.

Celgene and the Sustainable Development Goals
In 2017, Celgene’s commitment to building a healthy, sustainable future was recognized with Gold certification for Building — a 180,000 square foot state-of-the-art office building at the Summit East headquarters location in New Jersey. To achieve this distinction, a variety of environmentally focused attributes were integrated in the design and construction. These include:
Water quality and conservation measures such as the installation of efficient water fixtures and a cistern tank that collects rainwater, which is filtered and used for various gray-water activities, such as site landscaping
80 percent covered parking, further reducing the heat island effect and minimizing the impact on the area’s microclimate
Alternate forms of waste collection and recycling
We are also seeking to obtain certification for Building J, an existing standalone building on the southern side of the Summit East campus. The building’s complete renovation includes an interior demolition down to the shell of the building, a reconstruction for a multi-room conferencing center, and renovated offices and work stations. Obtaining certification for Building would increase Celgene’s portfolio of environmentally sustainable buildings. To date, some of the strategies and building attributes that have ben incorporated into the redesign and renovation of Building include:
Roofing system with white membrane (cover) to reduce the heat island effect
Minimal landscaping in areas adjacent to the building: The trees and plants selected include species and varieties which are drought tolerant and bred for ease of care.
No irrigation or permanent watering system was installed to account for the minimal demand for landscaping system.
Commissioning to ensure all systems are operating at original design intent and resource consumption levels
Continued purchasing of 100 percent of electricity derived from certified renewable energy sources for the campus and purchased using Renewable Energy Credits (RECs)
Low- emitting adhesives, sealant, paints, coating and floor systems to promote occupant well-being and air quality
Creation and adherence of a Green Cleaning Policy that includes sustainability criteria for cleaning products and equipment, establishes standard operating and auditing procedures, addresses safe handling and storage of cleaning materials and sets guidelines for staff training
Sustainable materials harvested to construct reclaimed wood walls: These beautiful walls are class with 6,000 square feet of wood from salvaged rafters, beams and joists from a 19th- century barn in Hamburg, Pennsylvania and clear- coated with a bio-based, solvent free sealer. Celgene has brought new life and beauty to these pieces in this space and, with the installation of these resurrected pieces, the historic barn structures will live on for posterity.
The Couvet facility, which will manufacture current and future products for blood cancers and inflammatory diseases for worldwide distribution, will use 267 building piles as heat exchangers with the ground for geocooling, and as a heat source via a heat pump. It is the first installation of its kind for an industrial building in Switzerland. The building will also incorporate solar photovoltaic panels hat will produce 200 MWh of electricity. These and other features have enabled the Couvet facility to earn a provisional Minergie label for low energy consumption. The site will employ 100 people when it is fully operational by early 2019.
Celgene invests in technologies that represent the forefront of modern advancements in efficient energy consumption for our various operations around the world. Our approach includes purchasing efficient lighting and making infrastructure upgrades and replacements that minimize our direct energy consumption.
Indirectly, our facilities continue to purchase electricity that is derived from certified renewable energy sources.

Water is used for a variety of purposes within Celgene operations, especially in R&experimentation, laboratory processes, and manufacturing of therapies, as well as personal consumption, facility cooling operations, and cleaning and maintenance operations. Celgene has consistently sought opportunities to reduce water use in these processes and, with the advent of efficient and cost- effective technology, to reuse and recycle non- potable water in other consumptive facility processes where feasible and practical.

Celgene’s research, manufacturing, office, and other activities generate waste in the form of hazardous, non- hazardous, and by- products. Our processes for reducing these physical types of waste aim to improve our environmental and economic bottom line through cost and emissions savings by using alternative forms of waste collection — such as recycling, incineration, and beneficial reuse and disposal.
Celgene R&laboratories that handle biological materials follow the Center for Disease Control’s Biosafety Level 2. Solid biological waste is collected as Regulated Medical Waste (RMW) and disposed of through our waste vendor. Sharps are disposed of in appropriate sharps containers and disposed of as All waste disposed of through our vendor is incinerated as a means of ultimate disposal. Waste vendors are preapproved through the contractor safety program and are subject to Celgene waste vendor audits. All biological waste is disposed of following federal, state and local regulations based on the site’s location. Recycling streams, which are now available at most Celgene facilities, focus on common waste types, including plastics, paper, and metals. We have incorporated the collection of organic (or biodegradable) waste at the Boudry facility, with more facilities expected to integrate similar programs by 2020, depending upon feasibility.
As Celgene continues to expand operations worldwide, we are committed strive to protect and preserve biodiversity and respect nature on and around our facilities in dialogue with local communities. As part of this effort, we evaluate operations to comply with international, national, and local regulations concerning the preservation of natural places, promoting open spaces, and assessing land use compliance. Celgene has developed plans to consider facility impacts on biodiversity and land when designing new buildings and renovating existing facilities. These plans include:
Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan, which establishes and communicates awareness of appropriate practices associated with pollution prevention techniques and materials to divert or prevent stormwater contamination
Spill response procedures that are used in the event of a hazardous chemical spill
waste disposal program that outlines procedures for disposal of hazardous wastes in compliance with the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act

Go Backtwo-time breast cancer survivor and mother of two’s thoughts on how to discuss the diagnosis with her children.
It wasn’t easy the first time. When Kimberly Jewett was 31, she found herself listening to a doctor explain what her breast cancer diagnosis meant and what her treatment options were. But at that moment, Kimberly was thinking less about herself and more about her daughter Kalli and her son Tyler, who were 6 and 4 at the time.
Answering that question wasn’t any easier the second time around. Four years after Kimberly survived her first battle with breast cancer, the disease came back as metastatic breast cancer that had spread to other parts of her body. Although she knew that three out of four women who are first diagnosed with an early-stage breast cancer eventually progress to metastatic breast cancer , it was still shocking news. Her outlook was significantly less hopeful: while 90 percent of women with breast cancer are alive five years after being diagnosed, only 36 percent of women with metastatic breast cancer survive that long.
Meanwhile, her children were also older. At 8 and 10, they had a better understanding of life and death, making the experience even scarier for them. They began asking difficult questions. When they asked if she was going to die, Kimberly didn’t know what to say.
Kimberly is one of the 266,000 women each year who have to come home from the doctor’s office and tell their families that they have breast cancer. These conversations are never easy. They can be even more difficult when young children are involved, which happens frequently; an estimated 30 percent of all breast cancer in women under the age of 45 is diagnosed within a few years after giving birth.
Now in remission once again, Kimberly is teaming up with her daughter Kalli to share their stories to help other families better navigate the difficult conversation and emotions that come with a breast cancer diagnosis.
The fact that conversations may be difficult doesn’t mean they should be avoided, according to Kimberly. When she was diagnosed, her initial instinct was to protect her children from the news. But she quickly realized that keeping her disease a secret would damage her relationship with them and undermine the trust she wanted in her family.
Her kids would have eventually found out anyway, Kimberly figured, which might have distorted the truth and amplified their fears. So she believed that it was better that they heard the truth from her.
“It was also hard to shield my kids from my diagnosis because was so emotional all the time,” Kimberly said. “My husband and decided to tell them once my diagnosis was finalized and we knew my treatment plan.”
Looking back, Kimberly believes that one of the best things she did for her children was to be open and honest with them. By sharing her feelings with her kids, she opened the door for them to share their questions and fears with her.
“They came to me with a ton of questions, like, ‘Are you going to be okay?’ and ‘Am going to get it?’” Kimberly said.
Sometimes, she admitted to them that she didn’t have all the answers, and that was ok. She told them that she wasn’t sure what would happen and what that meant for their future. But she assured them that whatever happened, they would find the answers together.
We continue to talk about what would happen if my breast cancer came back. All we can do is remain hopeful and continue to pay it forward by inspiring others and sharing our story.
Kimberly felt like she had no one to turn to for advice on breaking the news to her children. No friends or family members had gone through similar situations, and she wasn’t involved with any cancer support groups at the time.
So she started searching online for information. She found a comprehensive guide on BreastCancer.org on how to talk to children of all ages and bought children’s storybooks specifically dedicated to breast cancer. These resources were helpful in having those difficult conversations with her children.
Having now had these conversations twice with her kids, other mothers are turning to Kimberly for advice. She highly recommends an app called The Magic Tree for Breast Cancer , developed by Celgene, as a starting place. The app explains the disease in a kid-friendly way so mothers don’t have to navigate the conversation alone, according to Kimberly. It incorporates videos and games that help to answer difficult questions such as, “What is cancer?”, “Did cause this?”, and “Can you catch it?”
“remember reading my kids a book about a booboo on a mom’s breast, but the app does this in a video that is much more engaging for them,” Kimberly said.
Kalli—now 16—agrees. “We were so young, we didn’t understand what was truly happening. An app like this would have definitely been helpful for us.”
Kimberly said that because her kids understood what she was going through, they felt like they were part of her support system. They wanted to help her and, in the process, formed a deeper bond with their mother. Kimberly’s battle with breast cancer became a shared experience in their family.
“wanted to take care of my mom as best as could,” Kalli said. “She was always sitting in the same chair, tired and exhausted from her treatments. would ask if she needed anything. remember bringing her ice cream or whatever she asked.”
Her experience as one of her mother’s caregivers and witnessing cancer’s devastating toll firsthand certainly made a lasting impact on Kalli, who is now considering a career in oncology.
Having those difficult conversations helped to put everything into perspective for the Jewett family. Kimberly found incredible joy in sharing little moments with her children—such as watching Tyler pitch a 60-mph fast ball in a baseball game and taking Kalli to her first high school dance.
While the Jewett family are enjoying their busy lives together, they know that there’s a chance that Kimberly’s breast cancer could come back one day. “We continue to talk about what would happen if my breast cancer came back,” Kimberly said. “All we can do is remain hopeful and continue to pay it forward by inspiring others and sharing our story.”
To help facilitate conversations about breast cancer such as the ones that Kimberly had with her children, Celgene has launched The Magic Tree mobile app with input from patient advocacy groups and clinical experts. The Magic Tree is an educational interactive app with videos and activities designed to help families and their children (ages 5 to 8) to have meaningful and open discussions about a breast cancer diagnosis. The app is available for download in the United States on both Apple and Android devices.
