Operating Strategy
There are various definitions of the word “hold.” An older meaning, and for us the most relevant, is a place where people go to protect themselves and the things they care about in the face of danger. This is core to the values of NewHold. While we are a holding company, our name is based on the belief that there is a better way for companies to be owned and managed to allow them to grow and reach their full potential.
At NewHold, we focus on long-term ownership and growth of North American industrial and services companies. Our platform companies are formed around seasoned executives with a longstanding vision on how to build companies in their industries. Our companies actively seek acquisitions of smaller and medium-sized companies whose founders and owners value their customers, employees and legacies. These structures and strategies are designed to encourage investments in people, products and services that create long-term advantage over the competition.
