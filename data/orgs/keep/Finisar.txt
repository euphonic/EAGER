Site by FivePathsKey minerals of Tin, Tantalum, Tungsten, and Gold are widely used in the electronics industry to produce components used in a variety of products.  Central Africa, specifically the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and nine adjoining countries – Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Congo Republic, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia – is one region where these minerals are mined extensively.  Although the mining and trading of these minerals is crucial to the region’s economy, this region has been in conflict since 1998; the resulting extreme levels of violence, human rights abuses, and environmental damage are supported by the trade of Tin, Tantalum, Tungsten, and Gold, often known as: conflict minerals.
Because mineral mining and smelting is several steps removed from final product manufacture, tracing mineral origins is often challenging.  Finisar’s suppliers acquire and use minerals from multiple sources around the world, many from outside the conflict region, some from inside the region.  strives to maintain the highest standards of ethical conduct and integrity in all areas of our business.  As a manufacturer of products that contain these minerals, we are committed to procuring materials from environmentally and socially responsible sources.
It is Finisar’s policy to not purchase from known conflict sources, and we expect our suppliers abide by the same standard.  Further, it is our aim to purchase from only responsible, conflict-free sources, as validated by the Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI).  expects our supply chain partners to establish policies, practices, and due diligence measures that work toward ensuring minerals used in our products do not directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the or adjoining countries while supporting responsible mineral sourcing in that region.
As a member of the CFSI, has adopted the standard conflict minerals reporting template.  Additionally, we require our suppliers to use this template when reporting mineral sourcing data to Finisar.  In response to periodic surveys, suppliers are expected to provide prompt, truthful, accurate, and complete data regarding conflict minerals and the smelter and mining sources reported by their suppliers.  In our review of the data we receive from our suppliers, named sources are cross-checked against the list of known smelters / refiners, and the Conflict Free Smelter list, published by the  ( www.conflictfreesmelter.org )
In addition, should we become aware of concerns about suspect mineral sourcing, from other sources within in the supply chain, which may include conflict sources, requires the supplier(s) who purchase from those sources to conduct a prompt, reasonable due diligence follow-up to: confirm the traceability of materials used, investigate suspect sources within their supply chain, and implement corrective measures as needed to ensure a conflict-free supply chain.
As a publicly traded company, complies with the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Section 1502 and the implementation guidelines published by the SEC, which require supply chain reporting and reasonable due diligence with respect to the sourcing of conflict minerals, and conflict-free status.  supports our customers’ efforts to reach the common goal of ensuring a socially and environmentally responsible supply chain.
Follow Finisarunderstands that our success as a business hinges on our ability to demonstrate we are operating appropriately and responsibly. We recognize the impact our operations have on the environment and on the health and safety of our employees, contractors, and visitors. We take seriously our responsibility to protect the environment, our employees, and others who may be impacted by our operations.
is committed to environmentally sustainable business practices and minimizing our environmental impact throughout our entire business. Our approach is guided by Finisar's ISO-14001 certified Environmental Management System with cross-functional teams located at individual sites to comprehensively assess local environmental aspects and impacts and establish improvement programs and objectives based on those assessments. Global coordination is facilitated through a central, corporate-level steering committee.
has an Environment Health Safety (EHS) management representative who is responsible for facilitating and ensuring compliance across all operations. Finisar’s programs are in place to ensure our operations are compliant with international, federal, state, and local laws and regulations and best management practices are used, where practicable. Periodic compliance audits are conducted at major operations to ensure continued compliance.
Finisar's factory sites in Ipoh Malaysia, and Wuxi, China, along with design centers in Sunnyvale CA, Fremont CA, and Allen TX, are 14001:2004 registered.  It is Finisar’s intent to achieve 14001 certification at all major manufacturing sites or implement an equivalent environmental management system where appropriate.
Finisar's objective towards environmental sustainability and minimizing our footprint focuses on several key areas:
We assess the environmental aspects of our products and, to the extent practicable, minimize waste generation,  maximize material recyclability and design low energy consumption into the entire supply chain and product life cycle.
As an environmentally and socially responsible manufacturer focused on reducing the impact of hazardous substances on the environment, designs and manufactures its components and finished products to comply with  materials restrictions based on legal, regulatory, and market requirements.
Two key requirements for products include Compliance with the Directive regarding the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) 2011/65/and the Directive 2006/1907 on the Registration, Evaluation, and Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals.  comprehensive Green Program and a global, interdisciplinary team are in place to ensure compliance.
Additionally, complies with the China RoDirective  Phase 1  Labeling and Substance Disclosure requirements. Each shipment includes the Product Content Disclosure and  associated packaging is properly marked with China and international recycling marks.
Finisar's success has always depended on the talents and commitment of our employees. This principle holds true in the area of environmental sustainability, We strive to increase employee awareness of environmental issues at work and in the community through a continuing program of employee education and engagement.  At work, employees actively participate on 14001 teams, safety committees, “green” teams, and, at some locations, employees actively participate in the community sponsored recycling events or roadside cleanups.  Many of our recycling opportunities are driven from ideas submitted by our employees.
Environmentally Conscious Processes
We conduct our business while reliably and efficiently complying with all applicable environmental requirements. maintains careful control over the substances used in our business and factory processes, while taking steps whenever practicable to minimize, substitute, and eliminate the use of substances that are potentially hazardous to the environment and human health.
We have made great strides in reducing our environmental footprint by identifying recycling opportunities, setting objectives and meeting goals in all aspects of our business, from office spaces to factory floors.
To further demonstrate Finisar’s corporate commitment, has established the following corporate goals with 5-year targets (baseline year 2012):
Reduce Energy Consumption at manufacturing operations normalized to production by 5 percent,
Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions normalized to production by 5 percent,
Reduce Water Use normalized to production by 10 percent,
Reduce Total waste (hazardous and non-hazardous) normalized to production by 10 percent
tracks and reports Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions from major manufacturing operations. site emissions are below federal reporting thresholds. Nonetheless, opportunities for reducing emissions are reviewed and evaluated at each site. reduced emissions approximately 4% from 2009 to 2010 and an additional 15% from 2012 to 2014 based on annual revenue.
Energy consumption accounts for approximately 75% of Finisar’s emissions. Site teams are actively engaged in identifying energy conservation measures to directly reduce energy consumption requirements and achieved a 6% reduction through 2014 from 2012 levels based on annual revenue.
Finisar’s semiconductor operations are major users of water resources. Best engineering practices are employed to minimize water usage in Wafer FABs located in Allen, Texas and Fremont, California. Additionally, site-specific projects such as reusing (“reverse osmosis”) water and once-through cooling water, modifying landscape irrigation systems, and using native landscaping have been employed to reduce overall usage.  manufacturing sites reduced water consumption by approximately 12% through 2014 from 2012 based on annual revenue.
Wastewater treatment systems are installed and monitored to ensure water quality meets or exceeds permitted discharge limitations.
Pollution prevention activities focus on reducing material usage. Finisar’s Allen, Texas facility reduced purchases of non-production consumable materials by 85% from 2007 levels. Less consumable materials translates to less waste in landfills.  Other locations have implemented similar strategies to reduce the use of consumable products and enhancing recycling programs to reduce waste disposal in landfills.
Waste minimization projects at various sites have also significantly reduced the amount of hazardous waste shipped offsite.  For example, Finisar’s Ipoh Malaysia facility eliminated the use of Acetone solvent in its production processes.  Allen reduced usage of developer by 80%, and Wuxi China realized a reduction of 37% in waste normalized to production. 
In an effort to reduce electricity consumption and subsequent emissions, several locations are replacing fluorescent lamps with LEDs.  Finisar’s Allen, location donated usable fluorescent lamps to a local charity.  Lamp disposal, especially at Finisar’s larger production sites, contributed to overall increases in waste generated in 2014.  Waste volumes should decrease once these conversion projects are completed. 
Hazardous Materials
