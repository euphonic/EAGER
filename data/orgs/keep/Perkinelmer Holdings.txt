                    recent article in Chemical & Engineering News (June 4, 2018, pp 28-33) focused on activities in immuno-oncology, where biologic checkpoint inhibitors are being tested in combination with other immunotherapies: there are currently ca. 250 small molecule- and antibody-based immunotherapies in clinical studies, and > 1100 clinical trials in 2017 combined a checkpoint inhibitor with another treatment. 
                    We then attempted to ease their pain by exploring modern informatics tools and applications that guide them to rapidly and intelligently identify, locate, search, extract and organize tractable sets of relevant data (internal or external, structured or unstructured, small molecule or biologic) for detailed analysis and visualization.

Single-Cell ICP-Analysis: Quantifying the Metal Concentration of Unicellular Organisms at the Cellular Level
                This study uses single-cell inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and discusses the steps required for a successful single-cell ICP-analysis using a mammalian case study of the uptake of cisplatin into ovarian cancer cells and an ecotoxicological example of the uptake of dissolved and nanoparticulate gold into freshwater algae cells.
                Mass spectrometry is a go-to method for determining which molecules are in a sample. If security officers are faced with an unknown, possibly dangerous, substance, they don’t want to waste time sending samples to a lab and waiting for mass spec results, however. They’d rather be able to take a portable mass spec into the field to get answers quickly.

: In the 1960’s, the Carling Brewing Company of Cleveland, Ohio used the new Perkin-Elmer atomic absorption spectrophotometer to discover that bottled beer was contaminated by miniscule fragments of copper from the brewing kettles.
: Today, Long Trail Brewing of Vermont uses the Clarus® SQ8 to help maintain high quality standards for its craft beers — refreshing solutions that continue to refresh even today.
: In the 1950’s, our aerial panoramic camera lenses were capable of recording the entire state of Pennsylvania in two flyovers, with resolution that enabled one to count the autos on the Penn Turnpike.
: PerkinElmer’s sophisticated imaging technology enables discoveries at a cellular level, advancing critical areas of science such as disease research and drug discovery.
: Perkin-Elmer pioneered computer-aided chemistry with the introduction of the first microprocessor-controlled infrared spectrophotometer in 1975.
: We are now market leaders in electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) and software, providing over two million scientists worldwide with these technologies which replace paper laboratory notebooks.

Cord Blood and Cord Tissue Banking
ViaCord offers cord blood and cord tissue banking to expecting parents. ViaCord has banked the cord blood for more than 350,000 newborns.
Cord blood is the blood within a newborn’s umbilical cord which contains valuable stem cells. Cord blood stem cells can be used to treat nearly 80 diseases today, including certain cancers and blood disorders.
Cord tissue is the tissue surrounding the umbilical vein and contains different types of stem cells than cord blood. Cord tissue cells are showing great potential in research for treatment of medical conditions affecting cartilage, muscle and nerve cells.
Cord blood stem cells have been used in transplant medicine for nearly 30 years. Over the last few years a powerful and promising science has emerged called Regenerative Medicine. Areas of ongoing Regenerative Medicine Research Trials using cord blood stem cells include Autism and Cerebral Palsy.
Over 360 ViaCord families have used their cord blood in transplant or regenerative medicine research.  See how ViaCord is making a difference for many of these families.
