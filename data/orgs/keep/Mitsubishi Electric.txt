In addition, the Group continued to achieve its management targets for of 10% or more and an interest-bearing debt of 15% or less of total assets, recording figures of 10.9% and 8.4% respectively.
[Growth Targets to be Achieved by Fiscal 2021]
Bolstering Growth Strategies
Realizing Growth through Value Creation with Growth Drivers
The Group's strength lies in its abundant technological assets, which encompass a wide range of technologies such as control technologies and power electronics. In addition, the Group possesses a solid operating platform that encompasses materials procurement, production, quality assurance, sales and services, in all of which a culture of improvement is firmly entrenched. The Group is thus well-positioned to freely leverage its competitive edge in a wide range of diverse businesses.
With this in mind, the Group has positioned "making strong businesses stronger" at the core of its growth strategies. Currently, the Group has identified eight businesses—power systems, transportation systems, building systems, factory automation (FA) systems, automotive equipment, space systems, power devices, and air-conditioning and refrigeration systems—as growth drivers. Focusing on these businesses, the Group will expand its operations into markets worldwide, ranging from Japan, North America, Europe, and China to newly emerging markets, including those elsewhere in Asia. By satisfying the needs of each market, the Group will continue to provide and create value for its customers, and thereby secure sustainable growth going forward.
Additional Value Creation through Technology Synergies and Business Synergies
With the goal of securing its fiscal 2021 growth targets and sustaining its business expansion thereafter, the Group is accelerating and strengthening its initiatives to create additional value by combining and coordinating a wide range of technologies and businesses with each other, while enhancing each product, system and service.
Specifically, the Group seeks to improve the performance and reliability of every product and system it offers by creating technology synergies through novel combinations of its strong technology assets, and business synergies through the coordination of its diverse business activities. At the same time, the Group will improve its ability to respond to its customers' business challenges and needs by further accelerating combination of its technologies, products, systems, and service. Through these efforts, the Group intends to improve its profits by improving its reputation with its customers in existing markets and developing new businesses and markets.
Increasing the Allocation of Resources to Steps Aimed at Strengthening Competitiveness
To achieve greater business competitiveness, the Group will continue to allocate a high level of investment resources, including research and development and capital, to those businesses where the Group is capable of quickly securing growth while generating short-term investment benefits, as well as those exhibiting a high probability of expansion with little or no volatility, with the aim of securing returns on its investments. At the same time, the Group will review and refresh its business portfolio to reallocate its management resources to areas that show growth. Moreover, the Group will strengthen this portfolio by continuously creating new strong businesses capable of driving future growth. In addition, the Group is committed to securing a more robust technological platform through forward-looking R&that will, in turn, ensure sustainable growth from fiscal 2021 onward.
Additionally, aiming to augment its growth, the Group will actively pursue collaborative ties and M&As with the following three perspectives in mind: expanding its business by supplementing product groups and technology fields in which the Group is lacking; securing sales and service networks when advancing into new regions and markets; and reaching new customer demographics in order to bolster the Group's business platform.
Building Robust Management Foundations
To strengthen its management foundations, the Group continuously strives to improve its capital efficiency. As a part of initiatives to this end, the Group continues to expand net sales and reduce costs while engaging in activities with the aim of improving inventory turnover, trade receivables turnover, and Just in Time operations. In addition to implementing these efforts in an exhaustive manner, in fiscal 2016 the Group began utilizing an internal performance indicator, (calculated by Electric's own standards), to monitor asset efficiency by business segment, thereby improving the of all Group operations.
Looking ahead, the Group will continue to focus on generating stable cash flows, actively invest in growth fields, maintain well-balanced shareholder returns commensurate with profit growth, and diligently work to increase corporate value.
Continuous Innovation
The Group will steadfastly carry out its management policies guided by a commitment to balanced management, while putting into practice its overarching corporate statement: Changes for the Better. Each and every employee will share the common goal of developing new frontiers through continuous innovation, and the Group—by continuing to undergo transformation itself—will mature into a that is always producing something better.Global

The year 2001 marked the 80th year since the founding of Electric. It is also the year that we adopted "Changes for the Better" as our corporate statement. This statement expresses our commitment to ongoing improvement with the aim of continuously creating better products.
The story below outlines how the logo first came about, and how it and the corporate slogan have evolved into what is used today.
In the 1870s, the shipping company Tsukumo Shokai, which was the precursor of Mitsubishi, used a triangular water chestnut icon on its ships' flags, and it is from this icon that the current three-diamond icon originated. It is derived from the three-layer chestnut family crest of Yataro Iwasaki, founder of Tsukumo Shokai, and the three-leaved oak family crest of the Yamanouchi family, from the Tosa Clan. Records suggest that the company name was settled on later.
is established when Shipbuilding Co. (now Heavy Industries, Ltd) spins off a factory in Kobe to manufacture motors.
The official company name and typeface are decided. The font is called Mitarashi-ryu and is used until 1963.
The corporate slogan which translates as "with you today and tomorrow" is adopted (in Japan only) with the aim of building a familiar corporate image among consumers.
new corporate slogan, "ADVANCING" is announced. In the words of President Okubo, at the time, "we devised the slogan to cement our position in future industry through our technical expertise, and to establish a corporate posture of cultivating and nurturing management skills, so that a new corporate image would permeate the company both internally and externally."
Corporate Identity campaign is executed with the aim of boosting corporate image. The "Blue MITSUBISHI" corporate brand logo is devised for use in Japan to provide some sense of individualism within the Group. Overseas, a logo is created that teams the familiar red three-diamonds symbol with a simple "MITSUBISHI." new corporate slogan that translates roughly as "SOCIO-TECH: enhancing lifestyles through technology" is adopted in Japan. The overseas slogan is left unchanged.
On the occasion of Electric's 80th anniversary, the corporate philosophy is re-evaluated and the slogan revised to "Changes for the Better" as a consistent message both in Japan and overseas. The "Blue MITSUBISHI" logo continues to be used in Japan, while "ELECTRIC" is used overseas to provide distinctiveness within the Group.
companies within Japan begin using the red three-diamond corporate logo that had previously been used only overseas. The strengthening of business competitiveness on a global scale is further promoted in order to ensure sustainable growth.Global

Aiming to Become a Global, Leading Green Company
The Group established Environmental Vision 2021 to contribute to the development of a sustainable society, and is advancing initiatives to achieve a low-carbon, recycling-based society. While this Vision represents the company we aim to become by the 100th anniversary of our founding in 2021, our ultimate goal is to make lasting social contributions as a leading green company.
To this end, we are working to strengthen our corporate constitution and to contribute to society. Strengthening our corporate constitution refers to disciplining ourselves to use less energy and fewer resources in our manufacturing, and increasing production efficiency to the highest level possible. Specifically, this means reducing waste generated during production and thoroughly implementing the "3Rs" of resources: reduce, reuse and recycle.
Contributing to society refers to our commitment to ensure that some sort of environmental benefit or improvement is delivered when people use our products. As CO
 emissions from product usage can be as high as 40 to 50 times the emissions from production, offering energy-saving products can make a tremendous contribution toward reducing CO
 emissions in society as a whole. For this reason, we must always improve as well as optimize our technologies with a focus on creating and offering energy-efficient products. The same holds true for the development and diffusion of renewable energy systems and equipment, such as photovoltaic power generation.
Thinking about the future of the global environment and sincerely continuing these initiatives worldwide will make our actions more environmentally compatible and will make society more environmentally conscious. 
, our environmental statement, is what we must practice globally. By continuing to put 
 into practice around the world, the Group aims to become a global leading green company.
For details, please see the Environmental Vision 2021.

To Our Shareholders
Looking back on the economic situation during the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 (hereinafter, "fiscal 2017"), the economy experienced steady expansion and Japan and Europe saw moderate recovery, while the slowdown in the Chinese economy eased somewhat. Turning to movements in foreign currency exchange rates, although the yen strengthened compared to the previous fiscal year, there was depreciation of the yen following the presidential election in November.
Under these circumstances, the Group placed greater emphasis than ever before on promoting growth strategies rooted in its competitive advantages, as well as on initiatives to boost its competitiveness and strengthen its management structure.
As a result, the Group recorded consolidated net sales of ¥4,238.6 billion in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2017 – a decrease of 4% compared to the previous fiscal year. Operating income decreased 10% year-on-year to ¥270.1 billion, for a Group operating income ratio of 6.4%. Moving forward, the plan is to implement initiatives that will enable the Group to maintain a return on equity (ROE) above 10%, while keeping the ratio of interest-bearing debt to total assets below 15%, in accordance with management targets. At the same time, the goal is to achieve consolidated net sales of ¥5.0 trillion or more and an operating income ratio of 8% or more by fiscal 2021.
Toward securing these fiscal 2021 growth targets and sustained business expansion, the Group is accelerating and strengthening its initiatives to create additional value through technology and business synergies.
Based on our Corporate Mission and Seven Guiding Principles, we of the Group position corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives as our main pillar of corporate management.

What is Green Procurement?
Green procurement is the procurement of materials with minimal effect on the environment, and it is essential to reducing the environmental impact of supplying the market with our products and services. Based on this understanding, the Group targeted green procurement as one of the priority goals of its corporate Environmental Plan, and formulated the Green Procurement Standards Guide in September 2000. Since then, chemical substance regulations have expanded worldwide, such as Directives on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS)1, the directive, the REACH2 and regulations, Japan's J-Moss system, and China's version of RoThe Group has taken this global trend into consideration, and has continued to revise the Green Procurement Standards Guide. Issues such as the preservation of biodiversity, reduction of greenhouse gases, and management of water risks have also been included in the Green Procurement Standards Guide in response to existing situations. The latest editions of the Green Procurement Standards Guide and other documents are available from the Document Downloads (Green Procurement / Procurement) page.
In 2008, the European regulation came into full effect, requiring the assessment and management of more types of chemical substances than before. In response, the Group adopted the information communication scheme provided by the Joint Article Management Promotion-consortium (JAMP). The Group ensures strict compliance with relevant laws and regulations by examining the content of chemical substances in procured materials and registering the information in an in-house database.
The Group conducts surveys on the status of our suppliers' environmental management systems as well as their compliance with laws and regulations. Suppliers that are outstanding in these areas are granted Green Accreditation, and as a policy the Group procures materials from suppliers who have obtained such accreditation.
RoHS: directive issued by the European Union restricting the use of hazardous substances in electrical and electronic products. From July 2006, it has become illegal to sell products containing any of the six designated substances in the Another four substances will be added to the hazardous substances from July 2019.
REACH: An regulation which requires approximately 30,000 types of chemicals that are produced and imported within the to be registered and subjected to risk assessment. Substances of very high concern because of their potential negative impact on human health or the environment must have prior authorization, and substances that pose an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment are restricted from production, import, and use.
What is Procurement?
In order for an organization to fulfill its social responsibilities of respecting human rights, promoting health and safety, and ensuring legal compliance, it must promote procurement, or take measures to appropriately address such issues throughout the supply chain, not just with its employees. The Group surveys and evaluates the status of suppliers' initiatives, and promotes improvement actions of issues that were given low ratings. Furthermore, we formulated the Procurement Guideline in June 2018 so that the suppliers could appreciate our philosophy and their compliance matters about initiatives. To confirm that our suppliers take action follow this Guideline, we request to sign "Consent Confirmation Form", which is attached in final page of this Guideline, by the responsible person.Global

Control of Hazardous Chemical Substances
Control of hazardous chemical substances
Control of Hazardous Chemical Substances
The Group categorizes and manages chemical substances in three levels. According to each level, we request suppliers to substitute, provide written guarantee of non-usage, or implement activities to eliminate inappropriate chemical substances, and to investigate the extent to which certain chemical substances are contained in their product(s).
Level I: Substances banned from being contained or attached (substances that are currently or are scheduled to be banned)
Substances that have profound impact on people's health and on the ecosystem, and whose use is prohibited or restricted under domestic or international laws and regulations, or is voluntarily prohibited by the Group
Level II: Substances scheduled for elimination
Substances that do not fall under Level I, but whose use in products should be reduced, as governed by domestic or international laws and regulations, or by the Group's voluntary restrictions
Level III: Substances to be quantified
Substances that fall under neither Level nor II, but whose presence in a product must be assessed and understood
Compliance with Chemical Substance Regulations
The Group promotes green procurement by obtaining information on the chemical content of parts and materials we procure from our suppliers along with their written guarantee of non-usage in order to ensure supplier reliability. When deemed necessary, we use the information to analyze the presence of chemical substances at our initiative.
We test for the presence of chemical substances by using fluorescent X-ray analysis screening and a one-drop extraction method (an analysis method developed by Electric), and obtain chemical substance information from our suppliers based on the information sharing format provided by the Japan Article Management Promotion-consortium (JAMP). We will continue strengthening our management systems in order to prevent contamination by the specific substances and to ensure their traceability.

To realize sustained growth and increase corporate value, the Group works to maintain the flexibility of its operations while promoting management transparency. These endeavors are supported by an efficient corporate governance structure that clearly defines and reinforces the supervisory functions of management while ensuring that the Company is responsive to the expectations of customers, shareholders, and all of its stakeholders.
Corporate Management Structure
In June 2003, became a company with a committee system. Key to this structure is the separation of supervisory and executive functions; the Board of Directors plays a supervisory decision-making role and executive officers handle the day-to-day running of the Company.
The present Board is comprised of twelve members (five of whom are Outside Directors, one of whom is a woman), who objectively supervise and advise the Company's management. The Board of Directors has three internal bodies: the Audit, Nomination and Compensation committees. Each body has five members, the majority of whom are outside directors. The Audit Committee is supported by dedicated independent staff.
salient characteristic of Electric's management structure is that the roles of Chairman of the Board, who heads the supervisory function, and the President & CEO, who is head of all executive officers, are clearly separated. Additionally, neither is included among the members of the Nomination and Compensation Committees. The clear division of supervisory and executive functions allows the Company to ensure effective corporate governance.
Internal Control System
For proper execution of duties by the Audit Committee, the committee's independence is ensured such as by assigning dedicated employees to assist in its duties, and the expenses and responsibilities incurred by the committee in the course of executing its duties are appropriately processed according to internal regulations.
framework is also in place for reporting to the Audit Committee. The Internal Control Department keeps the Audit Committee informed of information about and affiliate companies, and an internal reporting system is used to report that information to audit committee members.
Audit committee members attend executive officers' meetings and other such important conferences, and conduct hearings and surveys of executive officers and the executive staff of offices and affiliated companies. It also receives regular reports from the accounting auditor and executive officer in charge of auditing, and discusses auditing policies and methods and the implementation status and results of audits.
Internal regulations and system are in place to ensure proper operations by the Group. Within this system, executive officers undertake their duties on their own responsibility and hold executive officers' meetings to deliberate on important matters.
Executive officers themselves make periodic inspections of the operational status of the system, and the Internal Control Department inspects the design and operation of the internal control framework and regulations, and the status of internal reporting system and then report the result to audit committee members.
Furthermore, an internal auditor audits the operational status of the framework, and through an executive officer in charge of auditing, regularly reports the results of such audits to the Audit Committee.
Corporate Auditing Division and Audit Committee
Acting independently, Electric's Corporate Auditing Division conducts internal audits of the Company from a fair and impartial standpoint. In addition, the division's activities are supported by auditors with profound knowledge of their particular fields, assigned from certain business units.
The Audit Committee is made up of five directors, three of whom are outside directors. In accordance with the policies and assignments agreed to by the committee, the performances of directors and executive officers as well as affiliated companies are audited.
The Corporate Auditing Division, through the executive officer in charge of auditing, submits reports to the Audit Committee, which holds periodic meetings to exchange information and discuss auditing policies. In addition, the Audit Committee discusses policies and methods of auditing with accounting auditors, who furnish it with reports on the status and results of the audits of the Company that they themselves conduct.
Providing Directors with Appropriate Information at the Appropriate Time, and Conducting Reviews of the Board with Analyses and Evaluations
To strengthen the Board's capacity to supervise Company's management, the bureaus of the Board of Directors and each committee provide the directors with the information necessary for supervising management, in a timely and appropriate manner. And, to further improve the Board of Directors' capacity to supervise management, venues have been established for supplying information to and exchanging views with outside directors, and the Company is working to further enhance the provision of management-related information to the Board of Directors itself.
Additionally, in order to further enhance the functioning of the Board of Directors, the Board meetings are reviewed on an annual basis, and analyses and evaluations are conducted in the following areas.
Frequency, scheduling, and time spent on the meetings
The information supplied in relation to discussions at the meetings (quality and quantity) and the method of its provision
Materials, details and methods of explanation, question-and-answer guidelines, time apportioned for each proposal on the meetings
Other mechanisms for improving the functioning of the Board of Directors
Points for improvement of policies based on previous reviews of the Board of Directors, etc.
As a result of the recent review, the Board of Directors was evaluated for making ongoing improvements in response to the results of previous reviews and engaging in discussions in an even more active and open manner compared to before, based on the understanding that sharing timely and appropriate management information with executive officers is essential for the Board to properly fulfill its business supervisory function. This evaluation in effect endorses the performance of the Board of Directors, but further efforts will be made to enhance debates and discussion by the Board, such as by expanding deliberation times.
Policies regarding decisions on compensation, etc.
Compensation scheme for Directors and Executive Officers
Policies regarding decisions on compensation, etc. will be made through resolutions by the Compensation Committee, the majority of which consists of Outside Directors. summary of the policies is as follows.
Compensation scheme for Directors
Directors give advice to and supervise the Company's management from an objective point of view, and therefore, the compensation scheme for Directors is the payment of fixed-amount compensation and the retirement benefit upon resignation.
Directors will receive their compensation as a fixed amount, and the compensation to be paid will be set at a level considered reasonable, while taking into account the contents of the Directors' duties and the Company's conditions, etc.
Directors will receive the retirement benefit upon their resignation, and the retirement benefit to be paid will be set at a level decided on the basis of the monthly amount of compensation and the number of service years, etc.
Compensation scheme for Executive Officers
The compensation scheme for the Executive Officers focuses on incentives for the realization of management policies and the improvement of business performance, and performance-based compensation will be paid in addition to the payment of fixed-amount compensation and the retirement benefit upon resignation.
Fixed-amount compensation will be set at a level considered reasonable taking into account the contents of the Executive Officers duties and the Company's conditions.
The level of performance-based compensation will be decided while taking into account the consolidated business performance and the performance of the business to which the respective Executive Officer is assigned, etc. With the purposes of meshing the interest of shareholders with the Executive Officers and further raising management awareness that places importance on the interest of shareholders, and increasing the incentives for the improvement of business performance from the mid- and long-term perspectives, 50% of performance-based compensation will be paid in the form of shares. The Company sets a rule that, when the Executive Officers acquire the Company shares as a part of compensation, they are required to continue the shareholding until 1 year has passed from resignation.
The amount of the retirement benefit will be decided on the basis of the monthly amount of compensation and the number of service years, etc.
Effective Utilization of Outside Directors
The Board of Directors comprises twelve members, five of whom are Outside Directors (one of whom is a woman), who objectively supervise and advise the Company's management (composition ratio of outside directors: 42%).
Outside Directors receive reports about the activity status of internal auditors, the audit committee, accounting auditors, and internal control departments via the Board of Directors, and provide their impartial views regarding Electric's management from an objective perspective. By doing so, they bring greater transparency to the management framework and strengthen the Board's function of supervising management.
Criteria for Judgment of the Independence of Independent Outside Directors
Outside Directors are expected to supervise management from a high-level perspective based on their abundant experience. Those who are comprehensively judged to possess the character, acumen, and business and professional experience suited to fulfill that role, and who satisfy the requirements of independent executives specified by the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the requirements specified in Electric's Guidelines on the Independence of Outside Directors (see below) and thus possess no risk of giving rise to any conflict of interest with the general shareholders of the company, are selected as outside director candidates by the Nominating Committee.

Green Accreditation and Evaluation
Green accreditation and evaluation
The Group's Green Accreditation system is a means of evaluating and recognizing whether the environmental initiatives of our suppliers satisfy our Green Accreditation standards. By launching the system in fiscal 2007 and preferentially procuring materials from suppliers who have obtained Green Accreditation, the Group is striving to faithfully comply with the chemical substance regulations that are expanding on a global scale. Furthermore, in 2009, we launched a measure to survey the status of our suppliers' initiatives with regard to human rights, labor practices, health and safety, legal compliance, product safety, etc.
Specifically, we request suppliers to provide information on the status of their environmental management initiatives by filling in a Green Accreditation and Procurement Entry Sheet, and issues Green Accreditation certification to the suppliers who satisfy our accreditation standards. Suppliers who do not satisfy the standards are invited to attend a lecture session on green procurement, where they can receive support for enhancing their approaches to the environment. Furthermore, the results of evaluation are feed back to all suppliers. The supplier is required to develop and improvement with respect to issues we are given low rating while maintaining communication with the Group.
The Green Accreditation Entry Sheet contains questions concerning the following areas:
