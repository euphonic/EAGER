Our Sustainability
	is a renewable chemicals company specializing in bio-based materials that are used as inputs in a wide range of end products.
	Our commercial products are cost-competitive and exhibit similar performance characteristics compared to the non-renewable products they replace. Our sustainable products allow customers to reduce their use of harmful materials, such as formaldehyde and styrene-based chemicals.
EcoSphere® biolatex®
 biopolymers
. EcoSphere is in commercial use around the world in the paper and paperboard packaging industries. It is used to replace petroleum-based Styrene Butadiene (SB) latex binders, which are used to allow colourful graphics to "stick" to glossy paper used in magazines, books and packaging like cereal boxes. DuraBind
 biopolymers are a no added formaldehyde binder system used in the production of wood composite panels.
	is based in Burlington, Ontario and is publicly traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange (T:ECO).

At EcoSynthetix, our primary purpose is sustainability
We’ve held the same fundamental beliefs since our founding: the first is that the world needs to reduce its dependence on oil, and second, that sustainable products can work just as well and don’t have to cost more.
Our commitment to sustainability and our focus on creating products that meet at the intersection of performance, economics and sustainability – these are the things that allow us to create value for customers.
Certified to 14001:2004
Cradle to Cradle BronzeCertified
We’re proud that our products are part of an expanding group of more than 2000 unique products that have received Cradle to CradleCertification across a number of industries so far. This increasingly recognized certification qualifies our products as sustainably sourced, manufactured and up-cycled.1 They have met a strict set of criteria under the Cradle to Cradle CertifiedProducts Program in the following categories: material health, material reutilization, renewable energy and carbon management, water stewardship, and social fairness. Click here for more information on Cradle to Cradle Certification .
As a sustainability company, we strive to make a positive impact in what we do and how we interact with our environment. It is important to align our internal practices with the sustainable products we produce for our customers and in turn, walk our green talk. Our Green Team is a volunteer based committee that is dedicated to reducing our environmental impact, while also increasing the positive contribution we make in the communities where we operate.
We released our first Sustainability Report in 2015 (reporting on 2014) with Sustainable Hamilton based on the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines. Our 2014 report will serve as a baseline as we continue to strive and improve annually.
This report covered the operations at our Burlington location only. We will work to expand the boundaries of subsequent reports to include our other facilities. Similarly, we engaged solely with internal stakeholders for this report. As we continue our journey in sustainability reporting we will reach out to external stakeholders for input.
The data represented in our 2015 Sustainability Report was generated between January 1st 2015 and December 31st 2015.
12 Principles of Green Chemistry
Green chemistry is the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use or generation of hazardous substances. Green chemistry applies across the life cycle of a chemical product, including its design, manufacture, use, and ultimate disposal.
Polymers that are made from biomaterials or renewable content do not necessarily have a small environmental footprint. It can be a challenge for companies to adopt even a few of these principles. But given our commitment to sustainability, we’ve been able to adopt all 12. We use the 12 Principles of Green Chemistry to ensure that not only the feedstocks we use are sustainable, but our processes and production methods all improve safety and reduce our environmental footprint.
