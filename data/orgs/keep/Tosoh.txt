Review of Operations
The Specialty Group, comprising Organic Chemicals, Bioscience, and Advanced Materials Divisions, is the driving force for growth and change at through its promotion of product advances among diverse customers. The group boasts a wide-ranging portfolio of bioscience, organic chemical, and advanced material products that are typically strongly positioned and highly profitable in their markets. These are high-value-added products for well-established and for growing niche markets, and they serve to hedge profitability against the cyclical nature of Tosoh’s commodity operations.
Playing a key role in providing people with life’s essentials, Tosoh’s Chlor-alkali Group supplies global industry with the raw materials for the many products of a modern lifestyle. Manufacturers around the world depend on and its chlor-alkali, cement, and polyurethane products to provide their production lines with stable supplies of those raw materials. Its vinyl isocyanate chain gives the Chlor-alkali Group the largest fully integrated manufacturing capacities of their kind for chemical commodities in Asia, which ensures the stable supply of commodities to world markets as well as to various operations.
Tosoh’s petrochemical operations stay competitive by constantly adjusting to market challenges. Amid constantly increasing global petrochemical production capacity, Tosoh’s Petrochemical Group, comprising Olefins and Polymers Divisions, remains competitive by cutting its production costs and moving its products upstream. The group’s enabling of its facilities to use different feedstock lowers expenses and helps to hedge the risk of price fluctuations. At the heart of Tosoh’s operations, it supplies roughly half of the ethylene requires for its vinyl isocyanate chain and polyethylene operations.
Effective June 29, 2010, moved the water treatment business of its subsidiary Organo to its Engineering Group. The soil purification and remediation operations of Eco-Techno and the construction operations of Tohoku Denki Tekko Co., Ltd., all of which formerly were under the Service Group, also have been transferred to the Engineering Group.
Ensuring seamless interaction between company and customer, Tosoh’s ancillary businesses help the Group perform at peak by providing for timely delivery and cost advantage through a host of support services. It also requires the timely provision of those services—transporting goods and analyzing organic and inorganic chemicals, polymers, and electronic materials—to the company’s different businesses and to their customers.
products are woven into the things people use and encounter on a daily basis. They contribute to productive lifestyles and help people embrace the challenges of modern living.

Commitment to a Well-Run Company
Tosoh's corporate governance commitments focus on transparency, compliance, business performance, and operational efficiency. In place are a number of committees that all contribute to Tosoh's determination to be a good corporate citizen.
Other Governance Committees
Our corporate governance organization oversees business decision making and business execution. Tosoh's 16-member Board of Directors meets monthly to decide business matters and monitors managers who have operational responsibilities. The Executive Committee, which comprises the company's chairman, president, and senior managing directors, meets weekly to facilitate quick decision making on business proposals.
At the Management Reporting Meeting, the president is provided with background information on operating conditions and on pending decisions for individual business units.
The Board of Auditors made up of two internal and two external auditors monitors Tosoh's accounting system. It also observes the behavior and business execution of Tosoh's Board of Directors. The external auditors have no significant business dealings with or investments in and thus bring an objective perspective to the Board of Auditors.
The Office of the Board of Auditors assists the corporate auditors with their tasks. It uses third-party, outside accounting auditors to obtain independent verification of Tosoh's finances. The Auditing Section, meanwhile, conducts operational audits of Tosoh's business units and group companies and reports its findings to the company's president.
Additional committees handle specific aspects of corporate governance. They include the Compliance, Antitrust, Export Management, Internal Control, and Responsible Care Committees.
The Compliance Committee identifies external laws and regulations and internal guidelines and oversees related compliance by the Group. In addition, this committee prepares a manual that sets out the ethical responsibilities of the company and its employees. It also monitors compliance with these corporate ethics. Groupwide, conducts ongoing training to make employees aware of their responsibilities.
The Antitrust Committee collaborates with Tosoh's Legal and Patent Department to ensure that fair business practices as defined by the Antitrust Law of Japan and by Tosoh's internal guidelines are observed. The committee produces manuals that set out applicable practices.
In 2006, Japanese legislation established systematic guidelines for corporate internal controls to support accurate and reliable financial reporting. Tosoh's Internal Control Committee fosters groupwide awareness of and compliance with these guidelines.
Tosoh's Responsible Care Committee and Environment, Safety and Quality Control Department cooperate in achieving conformance with conservation and antipollution laws and with internal environmental preservation regulations. The committee publishes an annual 
Responsible Care Report
 that provides updates on Tosoh's progress in fulfilling its Responsible Care program.
