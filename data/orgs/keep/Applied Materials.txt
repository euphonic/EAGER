Working at Tasnuva - 
My career with started on my first day of graduate school,
with an ongoing research project that was followed by a 6-month co-op. was encouraged to be innovative and develop a test system from scratch, which resulted in a patent. Working at Applied, my manager and fellow team members give me the liberty to take risks, speak my mind, and make bold changes. Everyone on my team has diverse responsibilities that contribute to the team’s success, just like the different business units at contribute to the organization’s success.
Interning at has given me fantastic experience
 in the field of process engineering. Within my first week, dove right into hands-on problem solving that could directly impact the company.

Social Responsibility in India
India maintains a commitment to being socially responsible and creating a positive impact in the communities where we operate.  This is reflected in our business practices and diverse programs, including creating a thriving culture for our employees and engaging in community projects.
Environmental, Health and Safety Policy
The way we conduct our business operations helps protect the health and safety of our workforce, customers and communities.
Our organization focuses on five guiding principles for environmental leadership.
Maximizing energy efficiency: Using energy responsibly throughout Applied’s operations to reduce environmental impact
Designing for the environment: Designing products and services to minimize consumption of natural resources and maximize efficiency
Workforce and public outreach: Promoting environmental awareness among Applied’s workforce and the public
Pollution prevention: Reducing waste through reuse and recycling while also minimizing greenhouse gas emissions
Conserving natural resources: Using recycled and reclaimed and water
Through water minimization and recycling practices, facilities ensure that both water usage and discharges comply with local laws and regulations.
Our Austin, Texas water reclamation project has reduced our water consumption for irrigation by 4.7 million cubic feet (equivalent to over 53 Olympic-sized swimming pools) and by 70% since our peak usage in 2011.
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions
Our emissions have remained relatively flat in recent years—with Scope 1 and 2 emissions actually decreasing slightly, down about 10% from our peak in 2013 —despite a period of record product demand and increased R&activities.
Waste and Recycling
Materials’ facilities around the world continuously update recycling programs to decrease non-hazardous waste generation and increase diversion rates. Recycling programs have kept our waste diversion rate steady at around 75% in recent years. Packaging now account for roughly 70% of our total recyclables.
Global Clean Power Generation
We are minimizing our carbon footprint through onsite renewable energy production that supplements our green energy purchases from local utilities. Our onsite clean power generation has produced a total through 2017 of 35,896 MWh.
Singapore Operations Center Solar Array
Our Center has been awarded Singapore’s highest environmental honor – the Green Mark Platinum award – by the Singapore Building and Construction Authority.
Largest 5.7m2 photovoltaic thin film solar system in Singapore.
400 k(kilowatt) peak system that annually generates 450 mWh (megawatt hours) of electricity – enough energy to power more than 100 apartments for a year.
Installed low-e glass curtain walls and a rainwater recycling system.
All features result in annual energy savings of up to 30 percent.
Arques Rooftop and Parking Lot Solar Arrays
Established in 2008, the Arques rooftop and parking lot arrays include approximately 8,000 wafer-based solar panels to create an area larger than two football fields. The panels were manufactured by SunPower Corporation using equipment.
In recent years, green energy purchases have met 100 percent of the power demand for Materials’ Santa Clara campuses and powered 15 – 20 percent of operational needs in Austin. Solar arrays at our Arques campus in Sunnyvale provide roughly 5% of the total energy used annually—equivalent to that used by approximately 1,500 homes.
Harris Branch Solar Array
Since 2007, a 24ksolar array panel installed at our Austin campus has generated more than 34 mWh (megawatt hours) annually. The pollution-free panels eliminate 54,390 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions each year, roughly the equivalent of planting eight acres of trees. When first installed, this was the largest array at any Austin business site.
Xi’an Global Development Center Solar Array
In 2008, activated a 56 kilowatt solar array—the largest in Xi’an at the time—at our Global Development Center, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by more 65 tons per year.
employs a comprehensive Environmental, Health and Safety Management System (EHSMS) to protect the health and safety of its workforce, customers and communities. Fully integrated with business processes across all locations, the also incorporates formal risk assessments and mitigation practices, and these are validated by regular internal and third-party audits of our certified manufacturing sites.
We maintain an innovative, world-class supply chain by building lasting partnerships, enabling transparency and collaborating on solutions that optimize product cost, quality, delivery and reliability. We are committed to sustainable business practices throughout our global supply chain and to the responsible sourcing of used to make our products.
Our Global Supply Chain Organization (GSO) manages supplier relationships, develops supply chain capability and is primarily responsible for ensuring compliance with applicable laws, several industry standards—such as (Responsible Business Alliance) and guidelines —and our Standards of Business Conduct (SBC) .
Transparency in Supply Chains Act
is committed to the responsible sourcing of used in our products. The equipment and many of the spare parts we produce include components that contain tin, tantalum, tungsten or gold—commonly labeled today as “conflict minerals.” We do not directly purchase these minerals, nor do we have any direct relationship with mines or smelters that process these minerals. Our products, due to their size and complexity, generally consist of thousands of parts sourced from a multitude of suppliers. We rely on our direct suppliers to provide information on the origin of any conflict minerals contained in parts sold to us, including conflict minerals they obtain from lower-tier suppliers and smelters.
Our approach to verifying the source and chain of custody of conflict minerals in our supply chain is designed to conform in all material respects with Guidance. Along with other members, we have been a partner in the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) since its inception, when it was known as the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative.
In 2005, adopted the Code of Conduct. This code addresses issues related to labor, health and safety, environmental responsibility, management systems and ethics in the supply chain. We are taking various steps to optimize our supply chain management. The top 80% of our suppliers must complete yearly self-assessments to measure their compliance with the Code of Conduct, our Standards Business Conduct and related requirements. We similarly require that our suppliers observe applicable laws and regulations wherever they operate.
Supplier diversity is important and we are committed to selecting diverse suppliers whose products and services meet our supplier selection criteria and enable us to meet customer requirements. In 2017, we established a supplier diversity program to enhance the role diversity plays in our supplier selection process.
