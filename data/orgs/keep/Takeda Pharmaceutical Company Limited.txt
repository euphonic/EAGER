"Sustainable Development Goals（SDGs）"：Contribution for No.３「Good Health and Well-Being」
Since 2010, we have continued to donate ¥100 million for 10 years to training health care personnel in Kenya, Tanzania, and Nigeria through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria
In March 2010, launched the "Initiative", a financial aid program designed to develop and strengthen the capacity of healthcare workers through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (The Global Fund).
Currently, many millions of people die each year from one of the world's three major communicable diseases: HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. This constitutes a major obstacle to development and growth in developing countries; therefore, it is critical that the international community addresses these disease issues. African countries, in particular, suffer from very severe shortages of healthcare workers, which hinders their efforts to deliver the healthcare services needed to overcome such diseases. 
The Initiative aligns with international frameworks, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and United Nations Global Compact, and is positioned as a concrete effort to prevent the spread of the three major infectious diseases of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, which is one of the critical issues in global health.  
Takeda's donations support Global Fund-recommended projects in three countries and are aimed at helping to strengthen health systems, mainly by developing and upskilling healthcare-related human resources 
*The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (The Global Fund):  Donations within Japan are accepted by the Japan Center for International Exchange, which is the secretariat for the Friends of the Global Fund, Japan. 
What is the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria?
Based in Geneva, the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (The Global Fund) is a non-profit organization dedicated to raising and supplying funds to help prevent and treat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. The Global Fund was formed in 2002 in response to calls from then Secretary General Kofi Annan and the G8 group of nations, in the wake of the G8 summit held in Kyushu/Okinawa in 2000, at which the Japanese government declared the fight against contagious diseases to be a major international challenge. Since its creation in 2002, the Global Fund is supporting about $ 4 billion annually to projects in over 100 countries and regions, providing treatment for 11 million people, anti-tuberculosis treatment for 17.4 million people and 795 million insecticide-treated nets for the prevention of malaria.
Nigeria, Africa’s biggest economy and the most populous nation, has the second largest burdens of both and in Africa and is classified as a high TB, HIV, and MDR-burden country. It has one of the highest burdens in Africa in HIV-mother-to-child transmission, maternal and child mortality. The low coverage of HIV/services presents a formidable challenge. Intensification of efforts to scale up prevention, detection and treatment of the disease is therefore necessary.
Malaria is the single most significant disease in Tanzania, and approximately 44 million people (90% of the population) live in areas with prevalent seasonal malaria transmission. Tanzania has been successful in demonstrating significant impact in the fight against malaria; however, malaria remains a major public health problem accounting for 40% of the outpatient cases and about 36% of all deaths in Tanzanian children aged less than five years. The government of Tanzania aims to reduce its malaria prevalence below 1% by 2020. 
Steer the Country towards the Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in Line with the Global Stop Strategy
Kenya is one of the 30 high-burden countries for that together account for more than 80 percent of the world’s cases. is one of the leading causes of illness and death in the country with a disproportionate impact on women and children.

Takeda’s Approach to Risk Management
shares its Corporate Philosophy, which comprises its Vision, Mission, Values and Strategic Roadmap, with the entire Group and promotes the creation of a disciplined and sound corporate culture. Based on the above mentioned principle, has created a risk management system, making risk management an important component of corporate governance, functioning coordinated with internal control: promotes construction of a system in which each group responds adequately to risks and crises and ensures business continuity, and facilitates disciplined management in the Group. With regard to risk management, the “Global Risk Management Policy,” and the “Global Crisis Management Policy” respectively lay out the structure of risk management system including BCPs and crisis management systems of the Group.
The “Global Risk Management Policy” provides a uniform process of identifying, measuring, mitigating and reporting on significant risks with the objective of aligning risk appetite with strategy and improving risk responses. Takeda’s major potential risks include research and development, intellectual property rights, decline of sales due to the expiration of patents, etc., side-effects, drop in prices caused by measures for constraint of cost of medicines, fluctuation of foreign exchange rates, corporate acquisitions, country risks, stable supply, litigation, and security and information control. The person(s) in charge of each function control and manage these risk factors in each area of charge from the aspect of qualitative and quantitative criteria in designing and implementation of mid-range and annual plans and shall take all necessary measures or remedies available to avoid and minimize such risk factors, depending on the degree and content of the risk the is exposed to, in compliance with the countermeasures to cope therewith and any contingency plans.
strives to ensure that all possible preventive measures are taken to avoid potential crises in accordance with the “Group Global Crisis Management Policy,” which comprises basic policies, rules and standards for crisis management. The policy also underpins systems and operations we have put in place to respond to each type of crisis swiftly and appropriately. In this way, we aim to minimize any potential harm to employees, any impact on Takeda’s finances, and any effect on society at large in the event of a crisis.
The Group companies are responsible for establishing their own crisis management systems, implementing preventive measures, and taking appropriate action if a crisis occurs. In the case of a crisis that has a major impact on and requires company-wide action, a “Global Crisis Management Committee” chaired by the President & of coordinates a common understanding of the situation and any relevant information. The Committee directs each to take countermeasures, later following up on the implementation of the countermeasures.
