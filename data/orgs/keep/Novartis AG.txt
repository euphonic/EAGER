We aspire, as part of our vision, to be a trusted leader in changing the practice of medicine. To realize this vision, we need to earn and maintain the trust of patients, associates, healthcare partners, shareholders and the society we serve.
We recognize society’s expectations of our industry and of Novartis, and that we must go beyond just doing what is legal in order to meet legitimate expectations of society.
Our aim is to prevent issues from occurring, drive personal accountability for behaviors, and generate learnings that can be applied across the organization.
In 2014, we created the position of Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer, reporting to the CEO, elevating the Compliance function to the highest levels in the company. On April 1, 2018, the role was expanded to include oversight of our risk management functions. The new role of Chief Ethics, Risk and Compliance Officer was further elevated to become a member of the Executive Committee of Novartis.
We do not tolerate unethical behavior by our associates anywhere, and we will take all necessary steps to ensure compliance with our Code of Conduct and all applicable laws. At the same time, with more than 120 000 associates, we cannot exclude the possibility of misconduct by individuals. We therefore have extensive measures in place in an effort to ensure that reports of suspected misconduct are investigated thoroughly. Where misconduct is found, we  work to take swift and appropriate action.
With a goal of ensuring accountability of local country organizations, our management includes integrity and compliance questions as part of standard business reviews. We work to identify and mitigate risk exposure proactively so it can be reviewed and discussed at a management level.
Our goal is to maintain consistent standards of business practices across Novartis, ultimately enabling us to provide the best possible care for patients globally.
The Global Ethics, Risk & Compliance function designs and implements compliance programs associated with the Code of Conduct , Anti-Bribery Policy , Professional Practices Policy (P3) , and Conflicts of Interest Policy . Each division and Group function has a Global Integrity & Compliance Officer who drives the implementation of these programs, with the goal of ensuring ethical business practices by all associates.
In an effort to ensure compliance with ethical and legal standards starts with encouraging a culture of integrity. We establish, embed and enforce integrity standards across through our Code of Conduct.

Expanding Access to Healthcare
Through our core business – the discovery, development and marketing of innovative treatments – we have helped prevent and treat diseases, ease suffering and improve quality of life for people worldwide.
But as the size and complexity of the world’s healthcare challenges grow, we must widen our scope, extending our impact even further by asking: How can we effectively address the needs of underserved populations? How can we bring the benefits of our medicines to more people? And how can we do this in a way that is sustainable for our business?
It begins with a fundamental shift in the way we do business – with reimagining new ways to bridge the divide between those with access to critical healthcare innovations and those without.
We are committed to bringing more of our medicines to more people, no matter where they are. For all our new medicines, we will systematically integrate access strategies in how we research, develop and deliver globally. This will be a key measure of success for our leaders and employees.
