establishes, develops and operates its internal control for the purpose of efficient execution of responsibilities, compliance, risk management, information management and group company management.Basic Approach
Group regards compliance as "not only observing laws and regulations, but also as acting in accordance with the values and ethics required of the company and its employees as responsible members of society". Each and every employee is encouraged to perform day-to-day compliance activities in line with our three musts for compliance activities: to "be aware", "speak" and "rectify".
Is this in line with the philosophy and Code of Conduct?
Is this an improper practice?
Does this run counter to society's requirements and expectations?
As soon as you become aware of it, fix it.
Training and Raising Awareness among Employees
We conduct a host of training and awareness activities in the aim of instilling compliance awareness among all employees. Our primary shared educational materials are the Group Code of Conduct and its corresponding Group Compliance Handbook. We distribute this handbook to Group employees and take many opportunities to make use of it. We conduct compliance education for employees at every level of the Company, from new recruits to directors. At the same time, we hold theme-based group training and e-learning courses, and conduct groupwide compliance education.
Initiatives in Compliance Months
Group has designated October and November as Compliance Months, during which we implement measures aimed at tackling the variety of compliance issues faced by companies across our Group.
Employee Compliance Awareness Surveys
We have biannually continued to implement compliance awareness surveys at and affiliates in Japan. Designed to gauge employee awareness and understanding of compliance, these surveys aim to encourage recognition of compliance. Feedback is given on the results of the survey to our Group companies and divisions, and the results are used to make proposals for compliance measures at each organization. In fiscal 2018, we conducted compliance awareness survey from a view point of understanding of Code of Conduct.
Internal Reporting System
Group has introduced an internal reporting system to earlier detect and correct illegal acts. The Company has in place an internal reporting desk as well as an external reporting desk that makes use of outside third-party institutions (the Group Hotline), both of which allow employees to make reports anonymously. An internal reporting secretariat manages the content of such reports stringently, taking ample care to prevent people making such reports from suffering any negative impacts, looking into issues swiftly and taking appropriate action. In fiscal 2016, we newly set up external reporting desks for oversea affiliates. By the end of fiscal 2017, we have set them up in 10 countries and 40 affiliates.
Group considers security trade control to be one of its most important responsibilities as a company with global business operations. In accordance with the laws and regulations that make up the international framework on security trade control (the export control regime), we have improved and strengthened our management systems for cargoes and technologies that can be converted to weapons or military uses. In exporting products and providing technology, we conduct transaction screenings based on our Security Trade Control Regulations to ensure compliance with relevant legislation and are careful to prevent circumvent to countries of concern.
Group formulated the Group Anti-Bribery Statement in April 2012. In December, we published the Group Anti-Bribery Guide, and we are promoting activities toward creating a groupwide bribery risk management system.
