Watlow®, an industry leader in the design and manufacture of complete thermal systems, recently introduced its new ECO-HEAT® exhaust gas heating system that functions as an internal load bank in medium stationary and mobile diesel generator applications. Incorporating ECO-into a diesel generator’s aftertreatment system helps eliminate problems encountered under low generator load conditions, such as increased engine back pressure due to excessive soot loading, poor NOx conversion and fouled valves.
Unlike external load banks which require a completely separate footprint and waste their heat to the surrounding environment, ECO-is designed to be installed in the exhaust pipe and provides heat directly where it is needed within the aftertreatment system. Using electricity from the generator, it has the dual effect of increasing exhaust gas temperatures by both increasing load on the diesel engine and heating the exhaust directly. This saves valuable space and requires less energy, resulting in less fuel consumption. If generator load demand increases, the ECO-system gradually reduces its load and thermal output, and shuts off as soon as exhaust gas temperatures reach acceptable levels.
“Low exhaust gas temperatures resulting from low load or low ambient conditions can compromise the performance of your diesel generator’s aftertreatment system,” said Jeff Diestelmeier, director of global marketing, diesel emissions business unit. “These problems can lead to unplanned downtime and expensive repairs. You can think of ECO-as a smart internal load bank to help ensure that your diesel generator stays running when you need it.”

Electrical devices used in hazardous areas need to be certified for use according to the requirements specified for the area. The types of protection required depend on the risk involved in the area. In general hazardous locations in North America are separated by class, division and temperature class to define the level of safety required for equipment installed in these locations.
Class defines the general nature of hazardous material in the surrounding atmosphere and Class 1 states an area is hazardous because flammable gases or vapors are present in the air in quantities sufficient to produce explosive or ignitable mixtures.
Division defines the probability of hazardous material being present in an ignitable concentration in the surrounding atmosphere. Division 2 states the substance referred to by class is present only in abnormal conditions, such as a container failure or system breakdown.
The temperature class is used to designate the maximum operating temperature on the surface of the equipment, which should not exceed the ignition temperature of the surrounding atmosphere. T4temperature classification states that the surface temperature of a piece of electrical equipment will not rise above 248°(120°C).

Increasing the temperature rating of the original IECEx ‘e’ certification is attractive to many of Watlow’s customers, especially for those working on projects installed in hot environments. The higher enclosure ratings can eliminate the need for additional convective cooling features, additional insulation features and the need for sun shade, which can lower overall system costs.
“Many of our competitors have an enclosure temperature rating that is the same as their ambient temperature rating,” said Dennis Long, director of marketing, energy processes business unit. “Since Watlow’s enclosure rating has been increased, a likely result is less expensive system design.”
The IECEx ‘e’ certification indicates increased safety protection for the enclosures of tubular flange process heaters.
The principles of the increased safety protection concept are: no sparking contacts; no semiconductor devices (the failure mode is not possible to ascertain); no hot surface above temperature class; high integrity electrical connections; increased creepage (distance over insulation surface) between live parts and to earth potential; increased clearance distance (through air) between live parts and to earth potential; and high quality materials that have a rated continuous operating temperature of at least 20°greater than that achieved under rated voltage and at maximum ambient conditions. Achieving the additional IECEx ‘e’ certification provides customers a guarantee that the products they are buying are safe.
“Agency certifications, such as the Ex ‘e’ increased safety protection, are important achievements because certification marks are our customer’s assurance that our products meet rigorous standards for safety and reliability,” said Jeff Knobloch, product manager.

Temperature sensors that transmit electrical signals, such as thermocouples and RTDs, are often compromised when exposed to the electromagnetic environments found in plasma chambers where the noise couples onto the sensor and distorts the signal. Fiber optic temperature sensing, using the principles of fluorescence, enables operation in plasma environments providing stability, repeatability and cost effectiveness. As such they are ideal for determining the temperature of chamber components such as chamber lids, chamber baffles, electrostatic chucks, edge rings and showerheads.
Leveraging its strength in control systems, has combined advances in fluorescent sensing with its powerful EZ-control platform, creating an integrated solution for the latest semiconductor processing tools. Two versions make the system adaptable to all system requirements.
For those without the need to implement EtherCAT®, the EZ-module is a dedicated fiber optic input module integrating the power of the EZ-control system with one to eight channels of fiber optic temperature sensing. It can be used as either an expansion module or configured with built-in temperature control loops.  These two modules provide system designers with an integrated solution with the flexibility to expand the number of sensing/control zones as required.  The EZ-can be used independently when only sensing is required.
Real estate associated with a plasma chamber is expensive. Watlow’s fiber optic temperature measurement system is compact at just 144 cubic inches, and can be mounted on a DIN-rail, minimizing the size of the installed footprint.  Integration of the fiber optic probes (sensing head) are customized based on many factors including application environment, temperature regime, size constraints and material compatibilities.
Other system benefits include faster temperature sampling rates with high resolution, highly accurate fluorescent signal processing electronics and a highly reliable light source, designed to run at low currents for maximum life.
“The introduction of our fiber optic temperature measurement and control system marks a major advancement in this technology arena,” said Ray Derler, semiconductor business unit marketing director. “While the sensing technology has been markedly improved to advance both performance and reliability, this product moves beyond the sensor as a component and brings new, system-level, advantages to equipment designers. We are proud to introduce our fiber optic temperature measurement system because of the benefits the system will provide. Our customers have been telling us that they need a better solution that addresses reliability, accuracy and system level packaging. Our new system is the innovation desired for temperature sensing and control in plasma chambers.”
