Blood tests that can detect cancers without Biopsy
Genome Sequencing
Sequencing a person’s genome can identify susceptibility to various diseases, aid in early disease diagnosis, and enable precision medicine - personalization of therapy based on individual specific genomic biomarkers.
is developing an advanced 3nanopore – transistor device for sequencing the whole human genome with high accuracy, at one-tenth the current cost and time. Based on semiconductor nanotechnology, it will be over 100 times faster than protein nanopore based sequencers.
INanoBio’s sequencer will enable sequencing genomes of whole populations across the world.
Detecting diseases in early stages dramatically improves therapeutic outcomes. In Cancer, average 5 year survival rate is close to 90% when diagnosed at stage 1, and stands at less than 25% when diagnosed at stage 4. In contrast, cost of therapy when diagnosed post metastasis is approximately 2.5 times that when diagnosed at early stages.
is developing advanced nano-biotechnology tools that enable discovering of disease specific molecular biomarkers and detecting them in blood with ultra-high sensitivity. We are developing simple blood tests to detect cancers early, obviating the need for biopsy.

INanoBio’s mission is to develop high-accuracy early stage disease diagnostics that will enable early personalized therapeutic intervention preempting full development of diseases. We believe up to 90% of current diseases can be detected early and simply preempted, to usher in a relatively healthy future in two to three decades.
