In addition to biogas, ElectraTherm’s technology works especially well with satellite combined heat and power (CHP), district heating systems and geothermal applications.[/us_testimonial]
[us_testimonial author=”Gerd Knospe, etatherm” company=””]am pleased to report that the ORC, installed at a biogas plant in Trechwitz, Germany in 2012, continues to successfully operate as a commercial installation. The site is producing biogas through anaerobic digestion to fire a Dreyer & Bosse with an internal combustion engine that generates electricity to sell to the grid. The [ORC] produces additional power from the waste heat of the engine. With the current feed-in-tariff for the site (or the offset of retail power costs alone), attractive payback periods can be achieved.[/us_testimonial]

Flowery Branch, — ElectraTherm, a leader in distributed, waste heat to power generation, has partnered with Sigma Thermal to offer a complete waste-to-power packaged solution. The system, called the Emission Reduction and Power System, is comprised of Sigma Thermal’s process heater and ElectraTherm’s compact and robust Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) generator to offer solutions for oil and gas facilities, wastewater treatment plants, and landfills. The system is easy to transport, install and operate, while meeting tough emissions requirements, local codes and producing power from an unutilized resource. brochure with details on the solution is available here .
The Sigma Thermal process heating system converts waste gas to hot water, which provides the energy needed to power ElectraTherm’s Power+ Generator®. Options are available that allow for a supply of useful hot water discharge that can be used on site, as well as a hinged end-plate on the heater with easy cleaning access for dirty fuels. The entire system is delivered with interconnect piping and wiring provided and is skid mounted, ready for quick and easy on-site installation.
This partnership has produced an integrated waste gas-to-power solution that can dramatically lower onsite emissions from flaring and produce electricity from a resource, otherwise considered a nuisance. In oil and gas production and refining facilities where natural gas is being flared, the system can be used to convert waste fuel to electricity, minimizing (and potentially eliminating) flaring and significantly reducing emissions. At wastewater treatment plants and landfills producing biogas, the emission reduction system allows for easier management (than conventional generators) of gases containing hydrogen sulfide or siloxane contaminants and can contribute to the sites renewable energy goals.
