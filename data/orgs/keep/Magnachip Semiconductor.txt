Offers Automotive-Grade 0.18 micron Process Technology with up to 200Operation Voltage
Utilizing substrates and MagnaChip's proprietary deep-trench isolation technology provides advantages over the bulk silicon based that include higher isolation breakdown voltage, smaller isolation size, better substrate noise immunity, latch-up immunity and high-side isolation of power blocks with insulating silicon dioxide layer between active silicon layers and substrates. In this technology, two types of power technology (Laterally Diffused Metal Oxide Semiconductor) are supported up to 200The first type has low specific on-resistance (Rsp), which increases packing density of power blocks. The second type supports full ranges of (safe operation area) to guarantee long-term reliability with all ranges of (Drain-to-Source voltage) and (Gate-to-Source voltage). Foundry customers can select either type, depending upon their circuit requirements.
Many valuable option devices are also supported in the new 0.18 micron 200process to enhance design integration and flexibility. The option devices include high performance bipolar transistors, Zener diode, Schottky diode, high resistance poly resistor, metal-insulator-metal capacitor, metal-oxide-metal capacitor, electrical fuse and multi-time programmable memory.
Certain end markets, including automotive, require that power ICs are capable of achieving high-temperature reliability and high operation voltages. This is especially the case for Electric vehicles and hybrid cars as more 48battery systems are adopted. To meet these increased demands, MagnaChip's new 200technology was qualified based on the automotive-grade-qualification specification of AEC-Q100 with Grade0 temperature condition between -40 to 150 °C.
Kim, Chief Executive Officer of MagnaChip, commented, "We are very pleased to offer our 0.18 micron 200process solution for attractive applications including electric vehicles and solar panels." Mr. Kim added, "Our goal is to continue to increase our power technology portfolio to meet the demanding requirements of our Foundry customers in various markets."
