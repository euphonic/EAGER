Travel the path to endpoint management enlightenment with Quest KACE
Travel the path to endpoint management enlightenment with Quest KACE
Follow in the footsteps of Nick the Ninja as he uses Quest to battle the dark forces that threaten systems and eliminate the need to spend your days battling proliferating technology endpoints, security threats, system downtime, and compliance regulations.                
                    [PLAYING] This is Nick, an admin. Nick's path to enlightenment hasn't been easy. He's battled proliferating endpoints, security threats, system downtime, and compliance standards. 
The road Nick walks, one cluttered with multiple management tools. And this road has been a test of Nick's spirit, keeping inventories up to date, applying patches, manually imaging systems, fixing security threats, reacting to problems instead of anticipating them. All of this was a constant struggle. 
Further, using spreadsheets to track assets wasted valuable time, and was no guarantee of 100% success. And hours lost during the day meant Nick had less time to help prepare the business for whatever the future would bring. 
And when things went wrong, those who counted on his protection suffered. Nick couldn't find serenity. He felt powerless against the dark forces that threatened his endpoints, and helpless as his days slipped away. Nick needed a new path to enlightenment, a unified endpoint management path. 
In his search for answers, Nick found a new road, one of peace and confidence, one that gives him complete control of his environment. You see, Nick's journey led him to Kace. And now Nick is the ninja. 
Thanks to Kace, Nick possesses all manner of mysterious powers that give him control of unified endpoint management. His power of vision gives him insight into every single connected device and its software. His power of tranquility ensures devices meet ever changing compliant standards. His power of security updates endpoints with the latest patches, protecting against malware, APT, vulnerabilities, and more. 
His power of time automates manual tasks, saving hours of every day, while eliminating the specter of downtime. His power of change allows him to provision, image, manage, and secure assets across every platform. 
His power of simplicity allows management of multiple employee and corporate devices, as well as nontraditional assets with the internet of things from one interface. His power of foresight helps him anticipate problems and solve them before they can harm the business. 
Thanks to Kace, Nick is an ninja who strikes first and swiftly cuts down any evil threats to his environment. And when his work is done, Nick fades quickly into the shadows, knowing that a job well done means a quiet office, and a day that actually ends at 5:00
