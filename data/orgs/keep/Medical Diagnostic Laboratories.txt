Cancelspecializes in high complexity, state-of-the-art, automated DNA-based molecular analysis. By utilizing molecular techniques, is able to provide clinicians from many different specialties valuable information to assist in the detection, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of bacterial, viral and fungal infections as well as genetic based testing and cancer diagnostics. For example, the unique testing offers for the specialties of Urology, Gynecology and Pediatric Medicine enables the detection of multiple pathogens as well as certain drug resistance profiles from a single swab by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing. MDL’s primary focus is in the fields of infectious disease testing for Women’s Health and Gynecology, Pediatric Respiratory Infections, Urology, Vector-borne Diseases, Mycology and chronic illnesses.
is comprised of experts in the fields of Molecular Biology, Immunology, Virology, Microbiology, Mycology, Pharmacogenomics, Antimicrobial Resistance and Oncology. In addition to developing and validating new clinical tests, the Research and Development Department also publishes research projects in peer-reviewed journals, presents scientific information at international symposia, and performs contractual research work for major commercial, governmental, and academic organizations.
To this end, invites you to contact us with your ongoing needs for molecular medicine, as this field continues to grow.

Dr. Mordechai is the founder of this laboratory. He is a graduate of Temple University where he was the recipient of The Florence Gloria Freedman Cancer Research Award. He completed his post-graduate work at Barrow Neurological Institute specializing in molecular neurobiology. Dr. Mordechai has published many research papers in the fields of infectious disease and chronic illnesses. He is an Associate member of the American Association of Bioanalysts as well as the American Association for the Advancement of Science.
Dr. Martin Adelson is a graduate of the Fels Institute for Cancer Research and Molecular Biology at Temple University and a recipient of the prestigious Daniel Swern Memorial Fellowship. While in graduate school, Dr. Adelson’s research was focused on the modulation of a natural antiviral enzyme, PKR, to provide cells with the ability to resist infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). Later, he went on to complete his postdoctoral studies at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in the field of HIV-1-based gene therapy and became the recipient of a competitive Postdoctoral Research Fellowship from the National Institutes of Health, National Lung, and Blood Institute entitled, “Pseudotyped Lentiviral Vector Gene Therapy of Hemophilia.”
In 2002, Dr. Adelson began his appointment at Laboratories, (MDL) as the Director of Research and Development and quickly became known for his expertise in the development of assays. In the following years, Dr. Adelson led the investigation of co-infection agents aspects of Lyme disease, partnered with physicians and researchers throughout the United States on studies around clinical pathogen prevalence, and oversaw development of new clinical assays. Dr. Adelson is also known for his innovative work in areas of laboratory automation. In 2010, as the Principal Investigator, he became a recipient of a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) funding grant for the development of the acoustic dispensation of nanodrops of reagents to achieve a very high-throughput of PCR-based diagnostics. Dr. Adelson has implemented various innovations and re-engineering initiatives, as well as leveraged customized technology solutions, to re-calibrate and enhance MDL’s work flow. In multiple iterations, he directly formulated the work flow and authored all of the underlying software. Each modification has resulted in a qualitatively new level of testing quality and test throughput while reducing overall business costs.
Dr. Adelson is the author of more than 45 publications and 65 abstracts, a member of the American Society of Microbiology, the International Organization for Mycoplasmology, and the Association for Molecular Pathology. He served as a reviewer on the peer-reviewed Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Microbiology and The Journal of Infectious Diseases. He is also a member of the Thomas Jefferson University Biotechnology Advisory Committee, an Associate Professor at Rowan University, a Director for the Wadsworth Center New York State Department of Health, on the Scientific Advisory Board of Science Inc. at the Biotechnology Center, and a founding member of the New Jersey and Pennsylvania BioTech and Life Sciences Leadership Council. Now as the Chief Operating Officer of the Genesis Biotechnology Group, Dr. Adelson leads clinical, development, and discovery research operations in MDL, Venenum Biodesign, LLC, and Invivotek, LLC, with his main focus being shifted to scaling and expanding the existing business infrastructure through both organic growth and corporate acquisition.

The aim of the first three divisions is to identify potential pathogenic agents clinically germane to their respective focus of interest. Once identified, tests are designed for their identification in clinical specimens sampled using MDL’s proprietary OneSwab®, UroSwab® and NasoSwab™ technologies, as well as other medias, including blood, synovial and cerebrospinal fluids and ThinPrep. Dividing the pathogenic agents clinically allows to concentrate their efforts upon medically relevant infectious agents that meet the needs of both the physician and the individual through our extensive testing menus and rapid reporting times. MDL’s goal is to aid the physician in planning their course of treatment. Antibiotic resistance is a naturally occurring phenomenon that renders certain antibiotics, often times the treatment of choice, useless. As antibiotic resistant agents are identified, modifies its testing procedures to include reflexive testing that enables physicians to modify their treatment strategies. Such advanced testing is already available for ciprofloxacin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, clindamycin and erythromycin resistant Group Streptococcus, amantadine-resistant influenza A, and clarithromycin-resistant Helicobacter pylori.
Cytogenetics represents a new area of focus for Within this group, tests are being designed and validated for the identification of carriers of inheritable diseases. Initial tests under development are those most common in Ashkenazi Jewish populations. Our initial release screens for Cystic Fibrosis carrier status in OneSwab® and buccal swabs.
