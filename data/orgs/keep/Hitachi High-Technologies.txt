Transformative Schottky Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscope
Scanning electron microscopes (SEMs) are used to perform a diverse array of structural observations and compositional analyses based on their ability to obtain information through signals including secondary electrons, back-scattered electrons, photons, transmitted electrons, X-rays, and more. SEMs are thus implemented in a wide variety of fields such as nanotechnology, semiconductors, electronics, biology, and material science. In stride with expanding growth in these fields, there has been an immediate need for high-throughput SEMs capable of reducing observation times while rapidly obtaining large amounts of information.
The newly launched SU7000 provides improved signal separation of secondary electrons and back-scattered electrons through innovative technologies including a brand-new detector specifically designed to enhance precision as well as increase throughput. Previously, users had to individually optimize observation and analysis conditions, such as the working distance from lens to specimen, according to the type of signal chosen for acquisition. With the SU7000, the specimen chamber, detectors, and other elements feature a new design that enables users to simultaneously acquire several different signals without changing the working distance. Through these advances, the SU7000 effectively streamlines observation and analysis whereby reducing time input.
Moreover, the SU7000 incorporates an interface capable of simultaneously acquiring up to six different types of signals (conventional models can acquire only four different signal types), along with providing higher signal-acquisition speed through upgrades to the control system. As a result, the SU7000 successfully delivers a very high-throughput platform for specimen observations.
Additionally, the SU7000 is equipped with a large specimen chamber and 18 accessory ports, allowing for high performance with even greater versatility.
forecasts the sales of the SU7000 at 150 units annually. The SU7000 will be showcased at Microscopy & Microanalysis 2018, which will take place from Sunday, August 5, 2018 to Thursday, August 9, 2018 at the Baltimore Convention Center in Baltimore, Maryland, USA, and at the 2018 exposition, due to be held from Wednesday, September 5, 2018 to Friday, September 7, 2018 at Makuhari Messe in Chiba-shi, Chiba Prefecture, Japan.
will continue to promote development and sales expansion of highly sophisticated solutions and technologies by responding swiftly to the needs of customers and markets.
Capable of simultaneous observation of secondary electrons, back-scattered electrons, and X-ray analysis under one working distance setting.
Detects and displays up to six different types of signals at the same time.
Available with variable-pressure mode down to 300 Pa (optional).
* Class of SEMs with a resolution of 1 nm or less at 1 kV.

— Achieving even greater screening accuracy by adopting new measurement methods —
Tokyo, Japan, September 4, 2018－(TSE: 8036, High-Tech) announced today that its wholly owned subsidiary and analytical instrument manufacturer and marketer High-Tech Science ("Science") has developed the HM1000thermal desorption mass spectrometer to dramatically enhance screening accuracy for four types of phthalates ("Restricted Substances") for amended Rodirective*1. The use of four chemicals will be restricted in the European Union (EU) from July 2019. The HM1000goes on sale in Japan and overseas on September 4.
Phthalates are widely used as plasticizers for softening plastic and rubber in vinyl chloride products such as wire sheaths, electrical insulation tape, and packing films. These materials are contained in a wide range of items, including toys, household appliances, electronic devices, and other consumer goods. The recent amendment of the Rodirective has created the need for manufacturers to assess and manage the amounts of phthalates contained in parts and finished products, either as part of procurement or on the factory floor.
Since July 2017, Science has sold the HM1000 thermal desorption mass spectrometer. Through simplification of conventional testing methods*2, the HM1000 enables each sample to be screened for phthalates in under 10 minutes. Through HM1000, Science has not only helped customers to achieve compliance with the amended Rodirective, but it has also provided customers with a screening solution designed to reduce environmental impact.
HM1000 identifies the Restricted Substances by ionizing phthalates and using a mass spectrometer to directly measure the ionized phthalates. However, there were some instances in which the screening accuracy of the Restricted Substances was impacted by alternative plasticizers*3 and lubricants and other polymers used in certain products.
Science has dramatically improved the accuracy, with which the newly launched HM1000can identify the Restricted Substances. This has been achieved through the development of a new calibration function that uses data from measurements of alternative plasticizers as a reference.
lternative plasticizers can potentially impact screening accuracy as they have a similar molecular structure to the Restricted Substances. In addition, the HM1000is able to automatically recognize and remove the impact of lubricants and other polymers by simultaneously performing SIM*4 measurements to detect only the intensity of ions with specific masses and measurements to acquire the distribution of the intensity of ions with a wide range of masses. Through these new functions, the HM1000will provide even more accurate screening results.
The HM1000dramatically improves screening accuracy while maintaining the existing model’s features, specifically high-speed measurement, simplified measurement, and low running costs. By supplying this new model, Science will achieve further streamlining and simplification of a wide range of product testing processes for customers. Moreover, the new functions of the HM1000can also be installed in the HM1000.
Science will display an actual HM1000model at 2018 scheduled to be held at the Makuhari Messe (Chiba City, Chiba Prefecture) from Wednesday, September 5, 2018 to Friday, September 7, 2018. In addition, Science will present the HM1000A, including its new functions, at the new technology presentation session to be held in the N-3 Hall at Hotel New Otani Makuhari on Friday, September 7 from 11:45 to 12:35.
Under its Mid-Term Management strategy of aiming to become a global player in scientific equipment by 2020, High-Tech Group will continue to promote development and sales expansion, and contribute to global manufacturing through testing and analysis equipment. In addition, the Group will consistently aim to “be Global Top in high-tech solutions," and respond swiftly to the needs of customers and markets, working from the customer’s perspective as a fast-moving creator of cutting-edge businesses.
Amended Rodirective: The Rodirective by the European Union (EU) restricts the use of specific hazardous substances included in electronics and electronic equipment. Effective from July 2019, the amended Rodirective restricts the use of four new phthalates, specifically Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), Benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), Dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and Diisobutyl phthalate (DIBP).
Conventional methods: Including Soxhlet extraction via organic solvent and gas chromatograph mass spectrometry by thermal extraction and so forth, which generally takes 30 minutes to several hours for each sample.
1. Calibration functions using data from measurements of alternative plasticizers as reference
Di (2-ethylhexyl) terephthalate (DOTP) is included in alternative plasticizers used as replacements for the Restricted Substances.
has a similar structure to the Restricted Substances. The HM1000is calibrated for these substances that have similar structures based on ion intensity correlations. This has improved the identification accuracy of HM1000A, resulting in accurate measurements.
