offers the only spectral imaging camera in the world that can both identify and quantify gas releases in real time, so you can detect leaks faster and more efficiently than ever before. Real-time detection aids in preventing process disruption, safety and ignition hazards, loss of profit, and potential environmental disasters. Our Gas Cloud Imaging system is the next generation of leak detection, and we monitor at all points of the petrochemical industry.
Photonics' Gas Cloud Imaging (GCI) systems have been optimized for installation at all points of the petrochemical industry.
Founded in 2009 and headquartered in Houston, offers the only camera in the world that can both identify and quantify gas releases in real time. Rebellion’s Gas Cloud Imaging (GCI) system utilizes proprietary hyperspectral imaging technology with advanced detection algorithms to pinpoint the source and measure the volume and concentration of leaks. is the next generation for leak detection and monitoring at all points of the petrochemical industry.
