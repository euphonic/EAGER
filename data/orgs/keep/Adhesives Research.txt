Research, Inc. (AR) is a leading independent developer and manufacturer of pressure-sensitive (PSAs), polymers, tapes, films, coatings, laminates, 
 and drug delivery systems.
We are committed to being the most effective company in our field by:
Partnering with our customers
Developing and manufacturing the specialized products our customers seek for improving their product.
Established in 1961, AR’s humble beginnings originated in a converted garage to develop and supply specialty adhesive-coated materials and processing equipment to meet the evolving needs of the graphics arts label market.
Through several moves and expansions, grew steadily, developing new capabilities and technologies that enabled the company to address the unmet needs of new markets. Rapid growth led to facility expansions to include the U.S., South America (1980), Europe (1999) and Asia (2000). With headquarters in Glen Rock, and Limerick, Ireland, today the company’s facilities span over 250 acres, cover over 300,000+ square feet of development and manufacturing space and employ approximately 300 associates.
Research, Inc. is organized into two unique businesses:
 supplies high-performance specialty films, PSAs, tapes, coatings, films, laminates and components to the medical, pharmaceutical, electronics, industrial, and splicing markets
, a wholly-owned subsidiary, develops and manufactures client-specific transdermal and thin film drug delivery systems with pharmaceutical and biotech partners.
During the past 50+ years, has emerged as a leader in our field through the continuous development of core technologies and capabilities. Today we remain an independent company, committed to working with customers as our partners in the development of application-specific products that fill their unmet material needs.

Custom Manufacturing & Project Management
(AR) takes the lead on every step of your project, from prototyping and scale-up to validation and commercial launch.  With more than 20 coating lines in our state-of-the-art and European manufacturing facilities, we select from a variety of roll and die coating techniques to cast and cure aqueous, solvent and 100% solids coatings.
Our process development approach includes:
Optimum parameter selection through design of experiments (DOE) activities
Alignment of product specifications & process capabilities
Documented process validation to assure a state-of-control
After validation, conducts on-going monitoring of our commercial manufacturing processes to maintain a continuous state-of-control and compliance.
