was founded in 1883 when Capt. John Ford and John Pitcairn started the first commercially successful plate glass factory in the United States at Creighton, Pa. Known as the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., the enterprise focused on innovation and quality…and 135 years later, is still dedicated to these priorities.
During the company’s first decade, its flat glass production expanded rapidly through new facilities and acquisitions. In 1899, the business diversified with the construction of an alkali plant in Barberton, Ohio, to supply raw materials for glassmaking – the precursor to PPG’s chemicals businesses. year later, started building its coatings business by acquiring an interest in Wisconsin-based Patton Paint Co. which proved a good fit for the company because paint and glass products typically reach the customers through the same distribution channels.
During the 1900s, becomes one of the first firms to expand operations in Europe, acquiring a glass plant in Belgium.Glass and paint provided continued growth in the 1920s, as the automotive industry and skyscraper construction expanded.
The automotive industry starts using more glass as the open touring car gives way to the sedan.
revolutionizes plate glassmaking with straight line conveyor-based ribbon method – a vast improvement over the batch method (photo right.)
begins supplying aerospace transparencies, providing roll-up windows for the Ford Trimotor.
acquires Ditzler Color Company and begins producing more than 500 "harmonious hues" for 40 automakers.
introduces SOLEX® heat-absorbing glass.
shows its muscle and introduces Herculite tempered glass, several times stronger and more shatter-resistant than ordinary plate glass.
The year before Pearl Harbor is attacked, develops laminated aircraft glass. During WWII, the company converts much of its production into materials for military use and begins to develop synthetic resins that lead to plastics, high-performance paints and industrial coatings.
In the early 1940s, entered the optical products business with the introduction of CR-39® optical monomer. The company has a vision for its future as it patents CR-39 monomer and begins a journey into creating a successful line of optical products (which will later include Transitions lenses).This material still is used widely in prescription lenses, along with the company’s array of other lens materials.
Post-prosperity leads to increased car production and home and building construction. The company introduces lead-free house paints and begins to manufacture fiber glass for circuit boards, window screening and plastics reinforcement.
In 1952, established its fiber glass business, recognizing the potential of another type of glass product.
Cars get a new lease on life as revolutionizes the auto industry with the commercialization of the electrodeposition coating process, virtually eliminating rust (photo right.)
PPG's businesses are diverse. number of foreign production operations and strategic planning moves the company toward a global focus. At the same time, the historic plate process for making flat glass is becoming obsolete with the adoption of the much more efficient float process.
Reflecting its diversification, Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company changes its name to Industries. As a bonus, the company reaches $1 billion in sales.result of its diversification, growth and increasingly global presence, the company changed its name to in 1968.
The oil embargo and rising costs of gas and electricity revive interests in solar energy. is the first major corporation to develop a flat-plate solar collector.
expands its groovy color palette by introducing the DesignaColor System for custom-tinting consumer paints.
introduces TESLIN® substrate, a synthetic printing material that resists water, abrasion, extreme temperatures and damage. Its durability makes it ideal for passports, photo IDs, maps, menus and much more.
In 1989, begins a flurry of acquisitions that expand the company's offering of automotive, industrial, aerospace and packaging coatings around the world.
Becoming ever-more global, opens a new development laboratory in Japan for automotive coatings.
In 1998, proves its "can-do" attitude by developing more efficient solvent-based coatings for easy-opening lids on beverage cans.
silicas are used to strengthen the performance of athletic footwear, while flexible coatings add durability and color.
As the need for alternative energy sources grows, fiber glass plays a role in the manufacture of lighter and stronger wind turbines.
broadens its transparent armor product portfolio with the acquisition of Sierracin Corp., adding high-performance lightweight transparent armor solutions that can withstand severe ballistic and blast threats.
In 2008, makes the largest acquisition in its history, of the SigmaKalon Group, a worldwide coatings producer. SigmaKalon brought strong architectural paint, protective and marine coatings, and industrial coatings businesses, and it greatly expanded PPG’s footprint in Western and Eastern Europe, Asia, and Africa.
continues to accelerate the pace of its business portfolio transformation and to grow its position as the leading global coatings and specialty products company.
In January 2013, the company successfully separated its chlor-alkali and derivatives business and then merged its wholly-owned subsidiary Eagle Spinco Inc., the entity holding the former chlor-alkali and derivatives business, with a subsidiary of Georgia Gulf Corporation. The combined company formed by this transaction is named Axiall Corporation.  
also acquired the North American architectural coatings business of AkzoNobel in 2013 – the second largest acquisition in the company’s history at that time.” This acquisition has expanded PPG’s customer reach in the U.S., Canada and the Caribbean; it has also made the largest coatings company worldwide. With 2011 revenues of about $1.5 billion, the acquired business includes leading brands such as GLIDDEN, FLOOD, NAILS, and CIL, and will license the and architectural coatings brands and the architectural wood products brand.
135 years after its founding, still holds true to the spirit of Ford and Pitcairn: We Protect and Beautify the World, offering customers in a wide range of markets and geographic locations unique technologies, services and other solutions.
