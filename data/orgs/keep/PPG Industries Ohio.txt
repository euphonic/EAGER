Known as the Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co., the enterprise focused on innovation and quality…and 135 years later, is still dedicated to these priorities.
During the company’s first decade, its flat glass production expanded rapidly through new facilities and acquisitions. In 1899, the business diversified with the construction of an alkali plant in Barberton, Ohio, to supply raw materials for glassmaking – the precursor to PPG’s chemicals businesses. year later, started building its coatings business by acquiring an interest in Wisconsin-based Patton Paint Co. which proved a good fit for the company because paint and glass products typically reach the customers through the same distribution channels.
During the 1900s, becomes one of the first firms to expand operations in Europe, acquiring a glass plant in Belgium.Glass and paint provided continued growth in the 1920s, as the automotive industry and skyscraper construction expanded.

The year before Pearl Harbor is attacked, develops laminated aircraft glass. During WWII, the company converts much of its production into materials for military use and begins to develop synthetic resins that lead to plastics, high-performance paints and industrial coatings.
In the early 1940s, entered the optical products business with the introduction of CR-39® optical monomer. The company has a vision for its future as it patents CR-39 monomer and begins a journey into creating a successful line of optical products (which will later include Transitions lenses).This material still is used widely in prescription lenses, along with the company’s array of other lens materials.
Post-prosperity leads to increased car production and home and building construction. The company introduces lead-free house paints and begins to manufacture fiber glass for circuit boards, window screening and plastics reinforcement.
In 1952, established its fiber glass business, recognizing the potential of another type of glass product.
Cars get a new lease on life as revolutionizes the auto industry with the commercialization of the electrodeposition coating process, virtually eliminating rust (photo right.)
PPG's businesses are diverse. number of foreign production operations and strategic planning moves the company toward a global focus. At the same time, the historic plate process for making flat glass is becoming obsolete with the adoption of the much more efficient float process.
Reflecting its diversification, Pittsburgh Plate Glass Company changes its name to Industries. As a bonus, the company reaches $1 billion in sales.result of its diversification, growth and increasingly global presence, the company changed its name to in 1968.

broadens its transparent armor product portfolio with the acquisition of Sierracin Corp., adding high-performance lightweight transparent armor solutions that can withstand severe ballistic and blast threats.
In 2008, makes the largest acquisition in its history, of the SigmaKalon Group, a worldwide coatings producer.
