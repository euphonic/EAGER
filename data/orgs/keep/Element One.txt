Mechanical components such as pinching protection and the velocity of the retraction mechanism are electronically adjusted in a precise way here by the Tech Team. After approval and final cleaning, the devices are subject to another visual inspectio nand packaged in special cartons – completeness with an exact package list and a final photo report of the content is guaranteed.
