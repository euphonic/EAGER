SitemapStarted first domestic mass production of gummed tape
“SHOKAI” was established in Sugamo, Tokyo in April 1927, and started production of gummed tape. Gummed tape is tape coated by a water-soluble adhesive on craft paper and is used by wetting the adhesive surface for attachments such as stamps. At that time, the demand expanded rapidly as the cardboard box replaced the wooden box.
This is the origin of the adhesive technology and the precision thin-film coating technology of our company. We started our business in earnest as “CORPORATION*” in 1934 after we moved our base to Itabashi, Tokyo.
Company name was changed  to “CORPORATION” in 1984.
Started production and sales of gummed tape for packaging
was reorganized and was established. Head office and head factory were relocated to Itabashi, Tokyo
Started production and sales of gummed tape for seals and labels
1950s to 60s Stage of business base building
1950s to 60s Stage of business base building
We built sales offices in major Japanese cities including Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Sendai, and Fukuoka to respond to reconstruction demand after the war. At the same time, we established new domestic factories one after another, including the Tatsuno Plant (at that time called the “Kansai Plant”), which is the current main manufacturing base.
In 1960, we started manufacturing and sales of adhesive materials for seals and labels, which are our current major products. In addition, in 1962, we developed an automatic packaging machine (cardboard box automatic sealing machine) manufacturing department, and established in the industry a unique style that is the combination of “adhesive materials and related equipment” and that led us to today’s business.
