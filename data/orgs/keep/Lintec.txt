Since its start in 1934 as “CORPORATION”, dealing with manufacturing and sales of gummed tapes, our company has expanded its business into various fields including adhesive products and related equipment, or specialty papers, and has continued to steadily grow.
The spirit of sincerity in our company motto, “Sincerity and Creativity”, has taken root in each individual employee as our corporate culture, and is embodied as earnestness and brightness. On the other hand, regarding the spirit of creativity, think that it links us to the development and proposal of more differentiated and unique products and that each employee in the group companies has to return to their starting point to reconsider creativity as the driving force behind business expansion.
It is considered to be a big advantage of our corporate group that we continue to deliver various products to a wide variety of industries while combining our unique core technologies cultivated over many years at a high level of competence.

SitemapStarted first domestic mass production of gummed tape
“SHOKAI” was established in Sugamo, Tokyo in April 1927, and started production of gummed tape. Gummed tape is tape coated by a water-soluble adhesive on craft paper and is used by wetting the adhesive surface for attachments such as stamps. At that time, the demand expanded rapidly as the cardboard box replaced the wooden box.
This is the origin of the adhesive technology and the precision thin-film coating technology of our company. We started our business in earnest as “CORPORATION*” in 1934 after we moved our base to Itabashi, Tokyo.
Company name was changed  to “CORPORATION” in 1984.
Started production and sales of gummed tape for packaging
was reorganized and was established. Head office and head factory were relocated to Itabashi, Tokyo
Started production and sales of gummed tape for seals and labels
1950s to 60s Stage of business base building
1950s to 60s Stage of business base building
We built sales offices in major Japanese cities including Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Sendai, and Fukuoka to respond to reconstruction demand after the war. At the same time, we established new domestic factories one after another, including the Tatsuno Plant (at that time called the “Kansai Plant”), which is the current main manufacturing base.
In 1960, we started manufacturing and sales of adhesive materials for seals and labels, which are our current major products. In addition, in 1962, we developed an automatic packaging machine (cardboard box automatic sealing machine) manufacturing department, and established in the industry a unique style that is the combination of “adhesive materials and related equipment” and that led us to today’s business.
Osaka Office was opened. From this year, started to develop sales nationally and establish large-scale bases
Established the laboratory in the head office in Itabashi, and started full-scale development of technologies and products
Warabi Plant in Saitama Prefecture, was opened and the mass production system for gummed tape was established

Entered into new businesses one after another
In the 1970s, we started developing and manufacturing labeling machines and label printing machines. In addition, we moved ahead with new application developments for adhesive materials including window films for buildings to enhance the safety of glass and marking film, so called “paint to be attached” used for signboards and body stripe stickers for automobiles and motorcycles.
In 1986, for the first time in the industry, we developed a curable dicing tape that can control adhesive strength by irradiation of ultraviolet rays (UV) and entered into the semiconductor-related field.
Developed the label printing machine "A-100 type", in which new technologies were incorporated, and started production and sales of label printing machines
Built the Kanto Plant (Gunma Prefecture, current Agatsuma Plant) as the products supply base in the East Japan region

We developed an integrated manufacturing system from upstream (base paper for release papers) to downstream (adhesive products), and at the same time, we expanded our business to the fields of specialty papers, release papers and films.
In 1991, we entered into the field of optical functional films for LCDs. In addition, during this period, in Indonesia and Singapore we established local manufacturing bases and sales bases, which still play the main role in our business in Southeast Asia.
