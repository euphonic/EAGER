The ECP5 Family breaks the rule that all FPGAs should be the highest density, power hungry, and expensive. With a focus on compact, high volume applications, optimized the ECP5 architecture for low cost, small form factor and low power consumption. These characteristics make the ECP5 devices ideal for delivering programmable connectivity solutions to complement ASICs and ASSPs.

Expands Ultra-Low Power sensStack with Optimized Solutions for Always-On, On-Device 
Expands Ultra-Low Power sensStack with Optimized Solutions for Always-On, On-Device 
accuracy with flexible milliwatt solutions; New reference designs for human presence and hand gesture recognition with scalable performance/power
New Compact Accelerator for iCE40 UltraPlus
 FPGAs with support for 16-bit and 1-bit quantization for improved performance, power, and accuracy tradeoffs
Enhancement to Accelerator for ECP5
 FPGAs with up to 2x increase in memory bandwidth, for improved performance in smaller devices
New hardware platforms, reference designs, and demos showcase scalable performance and power optimized for always-on, on-device applications
PORTLAND, – September 25, 2018 –
 stack designed to speed time-to-market for developers of flexible machine learning inferencing in consumer and industrial Ioapplications. Building on the ultra-low power (1 mW-1 W) focus of the sensstack, is releasing new cores, reference designs, demos and hardware development kits that provide scalable performance and power for always-on, on-device artificial intelligence (AI) applications.  
“Flexible, low-power, always-on, on-device is increasingly a requirement in edge devices that are battery operated or have thermal constraints. The new features of the sensstack are optimized to address this challenge, delivering improved accuracy, scalable performance, and ease-of-use, while still consuming only a few milliwatts of power,” said Deepak Boppana, Senior Director, Product and Segment Marketing, Semiconductor. “With these enhancements, senssolutions can now support a variety of low-power, flexible system architectures for always-on, on-device AI.” 
Examples of the architectural choices that senssolutions enable include: 
Stand-alone 
iCE40 UltraPlus
 based always-on, integrated solutions, with latency, security, and form factor benefits.
Solutions utilizing iCE40 UltraPlus as an always-on processor that detects keyphrases or objects, and wakes-up a high performance So/ for further analytics only when required, reducing overall system power consumption.
Solutions utilizing the scalable performance/power benefits of ECP5 for neural network acceleration, along with flexibility to seamlessly interface to on-board legacy devices including sensors and low-end MCUs for system control.
Updates to the sensstack include:
Compact Accelerator core
 for improved accuracy on iCE40 UltraPlus FPGA, and enhanced 
 for improved performance on ECP5 FPGAs
neural network compiler tool
 with improved ease-of-use and both Caffe and TensorFlow support for iCE40 UltraPlus FPGAs
Reference Designs
hand gesture recognition
 reference designs and demos
Modular Hardware Platforms
 – New iCE40 UltraPlus development platforms including 
Himax HM01B0 UPduino Shield
DPControl iCEVision Board
 – New vehicle classification and package detection demos from sensDesign Services Partners
senspartner eco-system
 continues to expand worldwide with new design service and partners focused on enabling smart home, smart factory, smart city, and smart car applications. “Lattice’s low power, small size FPGAs and neural network cores and tools, will significantly accelerate adoption of artificial intelligence at the edge,” said Amit Vashi, Chief Operating Officer, Softnautics, a sensDesign Services partner. “With our expertise in machine learning, we are proud to be working closely with to enable senssolution deployments as evident by our jointly developed vehicle classification demo using ECP5 FPGAs”.
