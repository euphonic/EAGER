Whenever the interface on a camera does not match that of the application processor, a bridge is required. common application example is muxing or merging multiple CSI-2 image sensors and combining them to one CSI-2 output. The CrossLink solution is a camera aggregator used for drones, 360 cameras, action cameras, surveillance and augmented reality applications.
The ECP5 Family breaks the rule that all FPGAs should be the highest density, power hungry, and expensive. With a focus on compact, high volume applications, optimized the ECP5 architecture for low cost, small form factor and low power consumption. These characteristics make the ECP5 devices ideal for delivering programmable connectivity solutions to complement ASICs and ASSPs.
