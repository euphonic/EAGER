For Sirona, as the dental technology leader, a functioning quality management program is essential to economic success.
Products and services of high technical quality and innovation set the standards in the market. Compliance with standards is required by our partners and customers. In order to fully meet these requirements, Sirona has implemented a process oriented quality management program, which focuses on our partners and customers.
The directive 93/42/dated June 14, 1993, which pertains to medical devices, serves as the framework of Sirona's quality management program. All member countries are subject to this directive and implementation is enforced by national laws in each country. The directive confronts all manufacturers and distributors of medical devices within the European Economic Area (+ EFTA) with the same requirements. Certification according to 13485 and according to Annex to the directive 93/42/provides proof of the highest quality, reliability and trustworthiness. Annual auditing by the TÜProduct Service technical inspection agency in Munich ensures continual improvement of our quality management system.
Sirona takes on the daily challenge of ensuring and constantly optimizing its high standards of quality. The Sirona quality management program provides employees with a well honed tool to meet the high demands of being a true leader in quality and innovation.
