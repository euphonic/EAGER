Quickly exceeding capacity of each new production facility, Chord made its final move to its current Wiltshire location in 2004. Originally concentrated on building interconnects, Chord cables had early success with Cobra and interconnect cables followed by Chord Chameleon analog cables- which are still in line-up today and selling better than ever.
