Art and Panny Art took the first step in realizing his dream by starting his company in a small garage in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He had little more than an unquenchable thirst for the science of design and a strong foundation in his wife, Panny. They put their honest work ethic into motion and watched their dream come to fruition in 1954 with the birth of Manufacturing, Inc.
In the early 1960s, became a forerunner in the market for fintube machinery. Art refined the design of the machine as we know it over a period of about 15 years. At the end of the 1960s, was shipping fintube machinery across the globe. With 24 and foreign patents on fintube-related equipment, it is estimated that as much as 80% of all finned tubes in the world have been made by machines.
In 1969, designed its first polyethylene fusion machine. Phillips Petroleum Co., one of the first developers of HDPE, knew of Art through previous contract jobs and approached him to manufacture a pipe fusion machine which could work with the unique characteristics of This first machine was known as the 4" Hand Pump. This prompted to improve upon the original design and create the worldâ€™s first centerline-guided, semi-automatic, hydraulic machine for 2" to 6" pipe.
In 1983, added the Fluid Power Division to the company. Fluid Power became a regional distributor of hydraulic components. The initial strategy was to lower their fluid power costs. It soon became a major venture to market hydraulic equipment nationally. Fluid Power was a leading supplier of mobile hydraulic components. Fluid Power was sold in 2004 to focus efforts on the growing fusion market.
Art was an outstanding inventor, engineer, designer and businessman who established strongholds in three separate industries before his death in 1988. During the same year, Chip McElroy, his son, took over the direction of the company leading it through its greatest period of economic growth.
has placed its stamp on the world as a leader in engineering and manufacturing. The of today is eagerly expanding and offering both fintube and pipe fusion products in new markets across the globe in countries like India, Australia, Russia and Brazil. is building on its history of innovation with revolutionary new products like the Talonâ„¢ 2000 â€” the largest machine it has ever built â€” for 2000mm pipe fusion and the No. 5 Applied Fintube machine.
