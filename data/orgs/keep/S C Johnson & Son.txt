In his early years running his new parquet flooring businesSamuel worked tirelessly. He was salesman, bookkeeper and businemanager. Five days a week, he toured the countryside selling flooring to contractors for fine homechurchehotels and public building
On Saturdayhe returned to Racine to fill out orders and tend to managerial dutieAfter the firyear, the flooring company showed a net profit of $268.27. And the businecontinued to grow, with sales coming in from Colorado to New England, and south to Mississippi. 
As sales multiplied, did letters from customers who purchased flooring, asking how to care for their new floorCleaning with the standard soap and water tended to ruin the floor’s fine finish, and the water warped the small blocks of parquetry. 
So, Samuel did what any good entrepreneur would do: He started looking for the beway to meet his customerneedCompany legend has it that he mixed up batches of floor wax in his bathtub, working to find the perfemix that would protefloors and give them a lasting glow.
Johnson’s Prepared Wax was the company’s firdiversification, setting us on an enduring path of growth.

The World Bank projects that 
the amount of solid waste generated globally will nearly double by 2021
, from 1.3 billion tonnes to about 2.2 billion tonnes of solid waste per year.* That’s a legawe don’t want for the landfills of today or for future generation
So, along with working to cut waste from our productwe’ve transitioned more than 65% of our factories to send zero manufacturing waste to landfill – with more coming soon.
Zero Waste Manufacturing: Doing More with LeZero Waste Manufacturing: Doing More with LeSin2000, we’ve been working to reduglobal manufacturing waste from facilitieWe try to eliminate waste before it’s generated, and to redirewaste that does occur for more environmentally responsible use.
Our goal was to cut global manufacturing waste by 70% by 2016, and we reached that target three years ahead of schedule. Today, we have lethan 0.5 kilograms of manufacturing waste per 100 kilograms of produshipped.

Not that reducing waste is easy. It takes observation and innovation, whiis delivered by our “Green Teamaround the world. 
Theteams help monitor and improve our sustainability practiceas well as educate about sustainability opportunities by suggesting procechanges in everyday operation
Here’s juone example: Our manufacturing plant in Indonesia gets materials in large metal drumOnused, thodrums were being crushed and incinerated, resulting in thousands of pounds of waste a year. 
The local team saw this as an opportunity for change and came up with a plan. Instead of incinerating the drumwe would partner with a local recycling company to refurbithem. They could then be used in recycling and tracollection in the open market.

Nearing Zero Landfill at Factories
                Beyond our global goal to keep reducing waste overall, we’re alworking to bring more of our sites to zero-waste-to landfill-statuIn 2017, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, became one of six manufacturing sites that successfully achieved zero manufacturing waste to landfill statu
Our sites in Toluca, Mexico; Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam; Rosslyn, South Africa; Kiev, Ukraine; and Nairobi, Kenya, went a step further in 2017 and reached zero waste to landfill status – sending no waste at all, including waste from cafeterias and offibuildingto landfill. 
We’re working toward all manufacturing sites sending no waste to landfill by 2021. Five years ago, five sites were zero manufacturing waste to landfill. Today, 17 sites are zero manufacturing waste to landfill and 14 of thosites are zero waste to landfill.
Solutions are rarely one size fits all. That’s why the Green Teams are empowered to find solutions that fit the unique requirements at easite. They have to be ready to adapt to the environment and to make the best, mosustainable choices for the situation at hand. 
Some sites compofood waste to be used for landscaping. At otherwastewater is treated for uas fertilizer in parks and other natural spaceIn Nairobi, Kenya, for example, it’s not that common for people to segregate waste, becaurecycling and the infrastructure required are not widespread. But the people there learned about the benefits of waste management and how to properly separate the company’s waste, and now the site is zero waste to landfill.

Companies often define zero waste to landfill in different wayFor u“zero means zero,” and we have a stridefinition. site musustain zero waste to landfill for a set period of time before being named as such. 
Some companies may claim “zero waste” with an asteriand a footnote, indicating they may permit small percentages of waste to go to landfill when it could have been diverted otherwise. We don’t. 
This almeans municipal waste treatment only contributes to achieving zero waste at if that waste is directed for composting or methane conversion. (We do make an exception for biohazard, medical or certain types of hazardous waste, a small fraction of our total global waste, sinlocal legislation may require special disposal of it.)
