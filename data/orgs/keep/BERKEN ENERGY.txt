manufactures  producing solid-state thermoelectric products using patent-pending technologies. These technologies allow us to produce highly reliable and long-lasting thermoelectric generating (TEG) products that establish new lower cost-per-watt benchmarks.
These low-cost and simple-to-manufacture solutions are poised to forever change the way is produced from renewable resources, thus reducing our dependency on conventional electricity-producing technologies such as coal, oil and natural gas.
We are excited to introduce Energy's new thermovoltaic modules.The Reclaimed ThermoVoltaic (RTV™) Apparatus can utilize any heat source as a feedstock to produce power, while our GeoThermoVoltaic (GTV™) application couples these modules with geothermal heat sources, opening up a whole new world of low-cost generation opportunities.
