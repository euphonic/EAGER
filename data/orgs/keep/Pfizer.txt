We've come a long way. Journey through Pfizer's history from the first storefront to the beaches at Normandy to the New York Stock Exchange.
In 1849, cousins Charles and Charles Erhart founded Charles & Company in a red brick building in Brooklyn, NY.
With $2,500 borrowed from Charles Pfizer's father, cousins  Charles  and  Charles Erhart , young entrepreneurs from Germany, open Charles & Company as a fine-chemicals business. modest red-brick building in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, New York, serves as office, laboratory, factory, and warehouse.
Their first product is a palatable form of santonin — an antiparasitic used to treat intestinal worms, a common affliction in mid-19th century America. Combining their skills, Pfizer, a chemist, and Erhart, a confectioner, blend santonin with almond-toffee flavoring and shape it into a candy cone. The "new" santonin is an immediate success and the company is launched.
The first domestic production of tartaric acid and cream of tartar, products vital to the food and chemical industries, is launched by Pfizer.
As demand for painkillers, preservatives, and disinfectants soars during the Civil War, expands production of tartaric acid (used as a laxative and skin coolant) and cream of tartar (effective as both a diuretic and cleansing agent) as well as other vital drugs to help meet the needs of the Union Army. Among these are iodine, morphine, chloroform, camphor, and mercurials, which, in addition to medicinal applications, are used in the emerging field of photography, the new medium photographer Mathew Brady employs to chronicle the Civil War.
The expansion propelled by the Civil War continues and Pfizer's revenues double. 
The company now has a substantially increased product line and 150 new employees. To accommodate this growth, it buys and renovates a post-Revolutionary-era building at 81 Maiden Lane in Manhattan and moves its headquarters there. The site carries the name for nearly a century.
Using imported concentrates of lemon and lime, begins manufacturing citric acid. 
soon becomes America's leading producer of citric acid. As new drinks like Coca-Cola™, Dr. Pepper™, and Pepsi-Cola™ gain popularity, demand for citric acid soars. It becomes Pfizer's main product and the launching pad of its growth in the decades to follow.
Spurred by America's westward expansion and its own growing number of clients west of the Mississippi, opens offices and a warehouse in Chicago, Illinois, its first location outside of New York.

On December 27, cofounder  Charles Erhart  dies and leaves a partnership worth $250,000 to his son William. 
However, the agreement stipulates that Charles can buy William Erhart's share at half its inventory value — an option Charles quickly exercises, consolidating ownership of the company in his hands.
leader in the American chemical business, marks its 50th anniversary. Its portfolio includes a wide array of industrial and pharmacological products, anchored by citric acid, camphor, cream of tartar, borax, and iodine. The company has offices in New York and Chicago, and its contacts in the import-export business crisscross the world.
statement made by Charles at the company's 50th anniversary celebration reveals where the company stands as it moves into the 20th century and into an increasingly competitive marketplace: "Our goal has been and continues to be the same: to find a way to produce the highest-quality products and to perfect the most efficient way to accomplish this, in order to serve our customers. This company has built itself on its reputation and its dedication to these standards, and if we are to celebrate another 50 years, we must always be aware that quality is the keystone."

would remain a privately held company until June 22, 1942, when 240,000 shares of new common stock were offered to the public
Emile , Charles Pfizer's youngest son, is appointed President at a special board meeting. 
He serves as President from 1906 to 1941 and briefly as Chairman in 1941. He is the last member of the Pfizer/Erhart family to be actively involved with the company.
At the age of 82,  Charles  dies while vacationing at his Newport, Rhode Island estate. tribute to in The New York Tribune notes that "by bringing to his task a thorough German technical education, great industry, and determination, he successfully met all difficulties and each year expanded his business."

Policies that regulate colleagues' interactions with health care professionals in the United States reflect our commitment to compliance with applicable federal and state laws and regulations. We review and revise our policies as we deem appropriate to meet the requirements of a highly regulated and complex health care environment.
California 1765 (California Health and Safety Code Sections 119400, 119402 or "Statute"), requires pharmaceutical companies to set a specific annual dollar limit on gifts, promotional materials, and items or activities that pharmaceutical companies may give or otherwise provide to an individual medical or health care professional as defined under the Statute. Accordingly, has modified certain policies and procedures that regulate interactions with covered medical and health care professionals in the State of California.
Additionally, in accordance with California Health and Safety Code Sections 119400, 119402 ("Statute"), our Compliance Program includes policies for compliance with the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) "Code on Interactions with Health Care Professionals."
Subject to this law, has determined that the annual aggregate limit on covered promotional expenditures is set at $3,500 per California licensed prescriber or other covered medical or health professional as defined by the Statute for annual periods commencing on May 1, 2008. This limit may be revised by from time to time. The foregoing limit does not represent a usual, customary, average, or typical amount for medical or health care professionals.
Pfizer's annual aggregate limit is based on an estimate of the maximum value of gifts, promotional materials, and other items or activities as defined herein that a medical or health care professional may receive in 1 year. In setting this limit, we have taken into account the size of the Company and the size of its product portfolio in the United States. is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the United States with one of the largest field forces.
The Company markets more than 20 products, many of which are prescribed by the same base of primary care physicians. This often requires multiple interactions with the same physician to provide appropriate information on our products. Our sales force has been advised and will be reminded that this limit applies to California licensed prescribers and other covered medical or health care professionals in California. We do not believe it applies to medical or health care professionals practicing in other states and who are not licensed in California. Each category of items or activities that are included in the annual aggregate limit—gifts, promotional materials, and other items or activities—is discussed separately below.
The PhCode allows pharmaceutical companies to provide "items designed primarily for the education of patients or health care professionals if the items are not of substantial value ($100 or less) and do not have value to health care professionals outside of his or her professional responsibilities," as long as they are not provided "in exchange for prescribing products or for a commitment to continue prescribing products" or "in a manner or on conditions that would interfere with the independence of a health care professional's prescribing practices." Our annual aggregate limit on certain promotion-related expenditures for purposes of California law excludes from calculation educational items that are permissible under the PhCode.
The Statute also subjects to the per-medical or health care professional annual aggregate limit all other "items or activities that the pharmaceutical company may give or otherwise provide to an individual medical or health care professional in accordance with the Guidance and with the PhCode." We include, among other items in this category, the retail cost of meals provided to covered medical or health care professionals in connection with educational presentations. Historically, has not limited attendance at these educational events. The per-medical or health care professional annual aggregate limit on certain promotional expenditures reflects Pfizer's commitment to responsible education and reasonable facilitation of attendance at educational programs in California. To comply with the Statute, will monitor and limit, if necessary, the number of educational presentations that covered medical or health care professionals may attend during the reporting period for compliance with the annual aggregate limit.

healthcare reports annually on the impacts that our programs have on the advancement of medical science, treatments and how we create innovative healthcare.
Pfizer's efforts to help build healthcare capacity and expand access to medicines would not be possible without our partnerships with nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), governments, and foundations. An important part of Pfizer’s partnership strategy is to focus on building and advancing relationships with large international organizations, civil societies, and foundations to help ensure communities in need get the healthcare they deserve.
Our strategy regarding global stakeholders and institutions is to focus on finding common objectives to advance public health and building programs that create solutions for communities in need.
We are also committed to the transparency and accountability of our programs, and aim to report on significant activities for a wide array of external stakeholders, including socially responsible investors and analysts.
Corporate Responsibility has a strong tradition of working with multilateral organizations, NGOs, and civil society organizations to help develop and deliver the interventions and information that cover global health issue-areas including active and healthy aging, non-communicable diseases, and access to medicines.
In addition to working with partners directly on issues regarding access, we work with various organizations based in Geneva and around the world to help inform governments and multilateral organizations and shape positive global health and policy environments for the industry. Multilateral organizations have significant influence in the global health field and can open opportunities or impose challenges and obstacles.
For example, we connect colleagues with multilateral organizations like the World Health Organization and global NGOs to proactively share insights, knowledge, and best practices, and to identify and communicate areas for shared investment and collaboration around global health issues.
is committed to advancing collaborative efforts to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with a wide range of chronic diseases for people across their life-course, and to help them achieve a healthy life at all ages. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are the leading cause of death and disability globally, and, along with infectious diseases, are contributing to a double-disease burden in people of all ages in low-, middle-, and high-income countries. actively partners with organizations to implement cost-effective interventions designed to prevent and control NCDs.
recent example is Pfizer’s partnership with HelpAge International. S2012, and HelpAge International have worked together to enhance access to health services related to NCDs among older people in Tanzania, particularly to address chronic conditions. The initiative involves support for organizations that help older people overcome myriad barriers to access in Tanzania’s health system. The project was expanded to focus on developing health messaging through an intergenerational approach. This project also encompasses initiatives aimed at improving data collection and analysis to inform appropriate policies.
Using our broad knowledge across many areas of global interest, Corporate Responsibility serves as a primary resource for responding to inquiries from Pfizer’s Socially Responsible Investors (SRIs). We also apply our expertise in analysis of global trends and healthcare data to overseeing the production of Pfizer’s Annual Review.Charitable Giving Towards Health Related Charities Events | Charity

At Pfizer, we put patient insights at the center of how we discover, develop and deliver new medicines and vaccines. To that end we often seek insights directly from patients as well as from those who advocate for them and represent their needs. These insights are invaluable as we seek to validate and/or supplement our working understanding of the patient condition. We engage every sector of government, society and industry, often times partnering with our peers to ensure we are maximizing all healthcare related benefits to our patients.
We believe medicines are among the most powerful tools for patients to cure, treat and prevent illness and disability. They can also help to reduce costs of other more costly medical interventions, providing long-term savings to healthcare systems. All patients should have appropriate access to the medicines their doctors prescribe. We’re forging partnerships across the entire healthcare system to make medicines more affordable and accessible.
Our work with our partners, including various governments and institutions, aims to provide tailored solutions that balance the long-term need for innovation with near-term government and payer budgets. Recognizing challenges with healthcare sustainability, we are actively exploring innovative approaches and new partnerships to transform the way brings medicines and vaccines to market and to help enable a shift to value-based care. We recognize our responsibility to be part of the solution and aim to be a leader in the industry. Our aim is to evolve from transactional relationships to true partnerships with governments and payers, focusing on improving health and patient access.
We are also engaging differently with patients – who are becoming more involved in their care – to help them better manage their health and get the best outcomes. For example, has several value-based agreements across different therapeutic areas with payers in the and is exploring others with a range of commercial and public payers. Value-based agreements align care in exactly the right way: around the patient, rather than pitting one stakeholder against another. They incentivize biopharma players to develop – and payers to reimburse – drugs that will have a meaningful impact on patients.
By partnering with stakeholders and patient groups we can broaden and accelerate our reach in discovering new and improved therapies and solutions for patients. These partnerships represent a wide range of objectives and insights to clinical research, creating novel funding models, influencing policy and access, and furthering advocacy-initiated guidance for regulatory submissions. Pfizer’s disease-specific partnerships have been diverse and have included: cystic fibrosis (nonclinical research); sickle cell disease (ethnographic research); lupus (preclinical research/disease understanding); lung cancer and liver diseases (clinical trial protocol and informed consent process insights); Duchenne muscular dystrophy (protocol design insights and benefit/risk assessment); and other rare diseases (novel funding partnerships).

Oncology Collaboration Patient Group Summit: look back at a one-of-a-kind patient summit Advocacy and collaboration for cancer care
In September 2017, invited patient group delegates from Central and Eastern Europe to a summit. The summit was designed to support patient organizations in the region to share best practices with one another and facilitate the opportunity to pose questions to oncology health and advocacy experts.
Żyjmy Zdrowo Foundation: has partnered and continues to partner with on a social campaign in Poland. The campaign aims at raising public recognition of the specific needs of the patients suffering from metastatic breast cancer (MBC). provided an educational grant for that purpose.
SPARC-ing Efforts for Change in Metastatic Breast Cancer
On World Cancer Day 2017, Oncology and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) announced the second round of Seeding Progress and Resources for the Cancer Community (SPARC) grants totaling $500,000 to organizations around the world to help patients globally. To date, there are 40 grant recipients in 19 countries participating in this first-of-its-kind public-private partnership.
In order to directly listen to the needs of women with MBC, Oncology partnered with cancer care advocate, survivor, and photographer Carolyn Taylor, founder of Global Focus on Cancer. Carolyn traveled around the globe to photograph and interview more than 40 women with metastatic breast cancer in 12 countries.
The Road to a Better Normal: Breast cancer patients and survivors in the European Union workforce
More women are surviving early breast cancer or living longer with metastatic disease. These women need healthcare policies that support access to treatment in order to return to their normal lives. Oncology partnered with the Economist Intelligence Unit to better understand how to improve policies and better address patient needs.
To raise awareness, support patients, and address unmet needs, partnered with 21 Latin American breast cancer advocacy organizations in an ongoing initiative called “Cada Minuto Cuenta (Every Minute Counts)." In Brazil, celebrities, cancer experts and athletes also supported the campaign, impacting 56 million Brazilians throughout the country.
has partnered with Rare Cancers Australia (RCA), which is working on a regional patient advocacy Mentoring Project to empower the patient voice across Asia Pacific. The aim of the project is to develop a mentoring program that will empower patient advocacy organizations as they address disease awareness and broaden access to medicines.
hosted acute leukemia advocacy advisory boards in 2015 and 2016 to better understand the patient experience and unmet needs of acute leukemia patients and caregivers. As a result of those meetings, partnered with Patient Power in Europe to develop two acute leukemia video "health centers" that include 88 videos featuring experts explaining and subsequent version of the hub, launched in 2017, augmented the video library with perspectives from both patients and caregivers.
In December 2017, organized the seventh annual meeting for hematology patient advocates at the American Society of Hematology congress. This is Pfizer’s largest annual global meeting for patient advocates, with more than 60 advocates attending in 2017. Feedback provided by the advocate attendees during roundtable sessions on patient/advocate involvement in clinical trials, patient reported outcomes, access, and therapy management has resulted in various projects and initiatives that will incorporate the insight we received and seek feedback from the leukemia and lymphoma community on an ongoing basis.
International Assistance Policy and Procedure (also known as Max Access Solution)
In 2015, began a collaboration with The Max Foundation, launching a pilot procedure to handle requests for cancer medicines ‎ for uninsured and underinsured kidney cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) patients living in lower-income economies outside of the where significant access hurdles exist. In 2017, the program was expanded to include additional oncology medicines for chronic myeloid leukemia, kidney cancer and lung cancer. Sthe program’s initiation, more than 100 cancer patients living in 14 low-income or lower-middle-income countries have been able to access ongoing treatment for free through the program. is continuing to work with The Max Foundation to find ways to get our products to cancer patients who need them in lower-income economies.
In 2017, created a global Kidney Cancer Advocacy Steering Committee in order to support ongoing engagement with kidney cancer advocacy leaders and integrate the patient voice into Pfizer’s kidney cancer research, activities and initiatives. The steering committee includes six kidney cancer patient advocates from five countries and two kidney cancer-focused healthcare providers who meet (virtually) with colleagues on a regular basis. The steering committee members help to understand the unmet needs and preferences of kidney cancer patients; collaborate with the company to evaluate, develop or support possible resources, activities and tools that could help patients; and receive updates on Pfizer’s commitment to kidney cancer and ongoing research. Outputs of the steering committee include a jointly authored poster presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Genito-urinary annual congress in February 2018, and the creation of a conversation tool to help patients discuss post-nephrectomy care with their doctors.
NCDs, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, chronic respiratory disease, and diabetes are responsible for the largest percentage of global morbidity and mortality (38 million deaths annually). The growing burden of NCDs, particularly in low-resource settings, is a huge concern. Eighty percent of NCD-related deaths take place in low and middle-income countries, and if the rise in NCDs is not reversed, we risk losing progress in health and economic development. As a result, Pfizer, along with 22 other pharmaceutical companies in partnership with IFPMA, the World Bank and UICC, decided to launch Access Accelerated, a first-of-its-kind, multi-stakeholder collaboration focused on improving care. Our goal of Access Accelerated is to help achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, and, in particular, reduce premature deaths from NCDs by one-third by 2030. All the companies involved commit to doing more individually by scaling up existing programs or developing new programs to address access to medicines and care.

To better understand barriers to earlier detection of risks for stroke, partnered with The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) to investigate stroke prevention policies in 20 countries. That knowledge then informed a comprehensive campaign to mobilize critical stakeholders and disseminate a call to action to improve detection of AFib—a major risk factor for stroke. High-profile experts and executives from international medical and patient organizations were involved. Through social media, we, along with and at least 17 participating advocacy organizations, reached more than 30,000 people.
held a meeting with 15 highly experienced Worldwide Patient Organizations in New York in October 2017 to share our Patient Centricity strategy and the efforts the company is producing to put the patient first. The Consultation Board participants have provided feedback that this is among the best kind of partnerships as it is a real opportunity to see into a company without filters and for advocates to provide insights.
Given the absence of a global patient advocacy group, which limits the ability of patient groups around the world to collaborate on common issues, established the “Stronger Together Against RA” initiative in 2013: a two-day forum for patient advocacy groups focused on the key issues facing patients in their region. In 2017, hosted the fourth Stronger Together forum, bringing together almost 30 groups from across the greater European region to develop a series of tools and resources to empower patients in their conversations with their physicians – a key barrier in achieving optimal outcomes. This year, is expanding the summit to Latin America, bringing over 30 groups from across the region.

At the conference, we’ll be featuring key partnerships that work to support family health. The Foundation* and partners 
 – the Foundation Healthy Families, Healthy Futures grants – that integrates the delivery of family planning information and services with childhood immunizations. These integrated services enable women to receive family planning at the same time their children are vaccinated, reducing clinic visits and creating opportunities to access care where there may be limited resources and women have little time to spend on healthcare.
To better understand what drives the effectiveness of this integrated care model, we worked with our partners and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine to evaluate the pilot programs across Africa and are encouraged by the 
high-level insights from the study
 and the best practices specific to the 
. The study found that the unique context of each country influences how integrated family planning and immunization services are delivered successfully, however, there were four overarching themes identified across all five countries that served as possible barriers or facilitators to family planning uptake and acceptance. These include:
		The socio-cultural context of the country, factors such as religion, food security, societal structure and beliefs about family planning
		Colocation of services, meaning family planning messages are delivered regardless of explicit requests for them
		Community engagement through health workers, health volunteers, influential community members, expert clients and religious leaders
		woman’s individual decision-making regarding her health and the health of her family
To help bring this program to life, we created an immersive 360-degree virtual reality film. The film tells the powerful story of one of the individuals receiving these services: Susan, a wife and mother of five children in rural West Pokot, Kenya. Through our partnership with World Vision, Susan is now empowered to take control of her health and family’s future. Meet Susan and experience her story through an immersive
