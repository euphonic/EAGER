Taking the Guesswork out of Medicine
Targeted Solutions for Serious Diseases
Our lead therapeutic candidate, (CAR) peptide, represents a new paradigm in targeted therapy. preferentially homes to, and penetrates diseased tissue while selectively augmenting the efficacy of therapies. can selectively boost drug effectiveness and reduce systemic side effects by enhancing the targeted uptake of co-administered therapeutics in preclinical models of pulmonary hypertension and  triple-negative breast cancer. Additionally, has shown promise in accelerating wound healing, enhancing gene therapy, ameliorating cachexia and in improving sepsis survival.
Our first interventional product, the endoarterial biopsy catheter, is the world’s first interventional device to obtain a biopsy sample from the inner layers of an artery in a minimally invasive fashion. Endoarterial biopsies will better enable the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of vascular-based diseases, and provide the synergy to develop a wide range of products, services, and pharmaceuticals that target vascular-based diseases.
Molecular Diagnostics
Our molecular diagnostic products and services will provide molecular analysis of endoarterial biopsy samples and provide a comprehensive profile of a patient’s disease. Performing transcriptional profiling of biopsies has long been a hallmark of modern cancer care. At VBS, we extend that paradigm to pulmonary and other diseases.

Awarded Up To $2.3 Million Fast-Track Grant From To Develop Peptide For Pulmonary Hypertension 
Announces Online Publication of Scientific Article Describing First Orally Available Disease Homing Peptide That Can Selectively Enhance the Effects of Co-Administered Drugs 
was founded to develop products that enhance and prolong human life. At VBS, we develop disease solutions as if we were developing them for our own family – because that’s what every patient is, a member of someone’s family. We make interventional catheters to obtain endoarterial biopsies, provide molecular diagnostic solutions, and advance targeted therapies for the treatment of serious and debilitating diseases.

Board of Directors
(VBS) is a biopharmaceutical and medical device company with operations in California and North Carolina with a focus on developing solutions for difficult-to-treat cardioand inflammatory diseases – the leading cause of serious illness and death in industrialized countries. At VBS, we are focusing on intrinsic causes and mechanisms of disease in order to lay the foundation for a robust array of next generation targeted pharmaceuticals, interventional devices and personalized molecular diagnostics.
Our lead therapeutic candidate, (CAR) peptide, represents a new paradigm in targeted therapy. preferentially homes to, and penetrates, diseased tissue while selectively augmenting the efficacy of therapies and accelerating wound healing. can selectively enhance gene therapy, boost drug effectiveness, and reduce systemic side effects by enhancing the efficacy of co-administered therapeutics.
Our efforts to find better solutions for treating vascular-based diseases has resulted in the world’s first and only method of endoarterial biopsy sampling that does not require invasive surgery. Furthermore, when endoarterial biopsies are combined with our molecular diagnostic techniques, a new age in disease detection and treatment is made possible, one in which the molecular signatures underlying each patient’s disease can be identified and therapeutics can be prescribed to precisely target each patient’s individual disease pathways.
