The difference between  Food Allergy and Food Intolerance is in the body’s response. With food allergy, the body’s immune system causes the reaction. With food intolerance, the digestive system triggers the reaction.  Allergy manifests itself almost immediately after inhalation or ingestion of a particular substance, whereas, with food intolerance , symptoms may occur within hours or even days, depending on individuals.
Food allergies are very common and generally confused with food intolerance as they could have similar symptoms.
Food Allergy is a condition wherein certain foods trigger an abnormal response in our body’s immune system. It is caused by the immune system wrongly recognizing some of the proteins in a food as harmful, triggering a reaction by launching a range of defense measures, including releasing chemicals such as histamine which causes inflammation. Food intolerance on the other hand,  does not involve the immune system meaning that while they can severely impact the quality of life, they are typically not life-threatening.
