Scholarship Awards Night at Tour de Cure in Napa Valley
Bio-Rad's Community Outreach Program
Reaching Out to Our Community
 takes great pride in serving its community! Our Community Outreach Program supports programs and activities that enhance science education and literacy for both elementary-school teachers and their students in our local communities. We also support some organizations in raising funds for diabetes and research. In addition, the company provides support to charitable nonprofit organizations working to improve the quality of life for many individuals within our local communities.
Inspiring the Next Generation of Scientists
 Most young people have a natural curiosity about the world around them, and many enjoy science from an early age. The hard part has always been to keep them interested in science as they progress through school.
That's why we feel that hands-on, fun, and interactive science education is the most effective way to foster a young person's interest in science careers. not only promotes science outreach activities, we provide students with opportunities to learn from real scientists. Every year, employees volunteer to work with students, helping them with science fair projects and more.
The Community Outreach Program also partners with local nonprofit science-education organizations to provide in-classroom science activities that introduce students to research techniques that are performed in today's labs. By helping students begin to build a foundation of science education at an early age, they are better prepared if they choose to pursue a career in one of the sciences.
Following the Educational Continuum
 Activities and organizations that supports follow the educational continuum of science education, from elementary school up to the university level. These activities and organizations include:
Science Teacher Grants Program
The Contra Costa Biotechnology Collaborative
Elementary school "science nights"
Summer science camps
Scholarship and Science Teacher Grant Information

Protecting the Environment
It takes a village! As if shrinking school budgets and the fast pace of scientific discovery weren’t enough, add in the Next Generation Science Standards, Advanced Placement redesign, and the economic imperative to develop a pipeline of students ready for careers. The good news is, all of these changes point to students developing the skills needed to compete in the 21st century. As a company that develops and manufactures instruments and reagents for the life science industry, research methods and engineering practices are part of our believes that the biotechnology industry should play an integral role in supporting education by helping to develop today’s students as tomorrow’s scientists, problem solvers, and leaders. We focus on providing teachers with the best resources possible so you can focus on what you do best — teach!
The Explorer Program not only provides classroom materials and curricula but also support for teachers just like you — including professional development opportunities, teaching resources, and access to the Explorer Community , where you can make connections with other teachers and scientists, find collaborative opportunities, and contribute to shared resources made by teachers for teachers.
Explorer Kits and Curricula
The Explorer Kit Curriculum Manuals have long set the standard for in-depth teacher background and preparation information with easy-to-implement student lab protocols and inquiry guides. In our lab textbook, Biotechnology: Laboratory Skills Course , educators are provided with a comprehensive solution for implementing core labs using a skills-based approach. Biotechnology may seem like a science with a very specialized set of techniques and concepts. The reality, however, is that molecular biology and biotechnology skills and concepts are now integrated into all life science disciplines. Biotechnology actually provides a toolkit for exploration in multiple subject areas from basic biology to ecology, biomedical sciences, and agriculture.
BioRad’s Explorer Kits are designed by teachers and scientists to integrate real-world biology topics and effective pedagogical practices. These kits provide hands-on activities that will inspire curiosity in your students, infuse inquiry into your lesson plans, and introduce innovation into your classroom.
“The kits are so well organized, easy to use, and self-contained, which allows my classes to do many more interesting investigations than would be possible without as a resource.”
Kristine Corolis Ridley College, St. Catharines, ON, Canada
