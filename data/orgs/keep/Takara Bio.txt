Our Cellartis brand encompasses over 15 years of experience providing products and services for research applications involving stem cells. The brand originates from a company of the same name (now Europe AB), which was formed by researchers from the University of Gothenburg in 2001.
Historically, a primary focus of the Cellartis brand involved developing and distributing stem cell lines—including both human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs)—for general or custom applications. More recently, the scope of the brand has expanded to also include products such as culture systems, media, and reagents, which make our expertise and innovative technologies more readily accessible to life sciences researchers. An important milestone for the brand involved the development and commercialization of the Cellartis DEF-Culture System, a revolutionary approach to culturing stem cells that offers significant advantages relative to other methods.
For the future, a point of emphasis for the Cellartis brand will be the development of products and services targeted at specific research applications involving hiPSCs. One recent example of this is the Cellartis iCell to Hepatocyte Differentiation System, which enables researchers to easily generate hepatocytes from iPSCs on demand, for applications such as drug development.

Murine Stem Cell Virus (MSCV) vectors were derived from the Murine Embryonic Stem Cell Virus (MESV) and retroviral vectors. Upon transfection into a packaging cell line, pMSCVhyg transiently expresses (or integrates and stably expresses) a transcript containing the extended viral packaging signal psi+, the hygromycin resistance gene, and a gene of interest. The vectors achieve stable, high-level gene expression in hematopoietic and embryonic stem cells through a specifically designed 5' long terminal repeat (LTR). This is from the murine stem cell virus and differs from the MoMuused in other retroviral vectors by several point mutations and a deletion. These changes enhance transcriptional activation and prevent transcriptional suppression in embryonic stem and embryonal carcinoma cells. Thus, the drives high-level constitutive expression of a target gene in stem cells or other mammalian cell lines when cloned into the multiple cloning site downstream of the 5' The murine phosphoglycerate kinase (PKG) promoter (PPKG) controls the expression of the hygromycin resistance gene (Hygr) for antibiotic selection in eukaryotic cells. pMSCVhyg also contains the porigin of replication and coli Ampr gene for propagation and antibiotic selection in bacteria.
Capturem purification membranes make use of next-generation technology to enable rapid, room-temperature protein and antibody purification and digestion protocols. Capturem membranes contain proprietary modifications that allow for a much higher surface area than traditional membranes. As a result of the large internal surface area, the membranes have higher protein binding capacities in a smaller bed volume than resin-based columns. High yield and purity are maintained because the small column bed volume traps fewer contaminants and allows large-volume washes. Combining established binding or enzymatic chemistries with Capturem membrane technology enables the creation of resin-free protocols for purification or characterization that provide high-quality results in just minutes. The faster processing time means that the proteins spend less time on the column and therefore are less likely to experience loss of activity or degradation.

The realization that bulk analyses drown out the unique genomic signatures of rare cell subpopulations—often a critical driving force in the phenomenon being studied—has made single-cell analysis increasingly necessary. The field, however, is still in its infancy, so scientists navigating these experiments must carefully evaluate the techniques and technologies they use for their experimentation.
In recent years, several automation systems have emerged that enable processing of large numbers of single cells. Given that single-cell biology requires large sample sizes in order to make significant statistical conclusions, a key consideration is how many cells the platform can process. While cell throughput is important, it is not necessarily the most crucial consideration, sthe number of cells required depends on the complexity of the sample and the sensitivity of the system (Haque et al. 2017).
When considering single-cell automation systems, you should certainly look for a cell throughput that matches your experimental goals, but there are additional parameters that can influence your confidence in the data produced. Open-platform systems allow you to more easily do the experiments you want, and you can trust that your results are a more accurate reflection of biological variation when systems have the ability to include positive and negative controls. Batch effects are problematic and can confound the data, so systems that reduce batch effects are desirable. The ability to image samples lets you tie sequencing data back to each cell. Finally, an end-to-end solution ensures that you are supported from sample prep through data analysis.
Research projects need to continually evolve to include new chemistries and sample types, and to ask different questions as new evidence emerges. One major limitation scientists may face is that some systems accommodate a limited range of cell or sample types due to size-isolation constraints of the system. Additionally, some systems may only be compatible with certain sequencing formats. However, the type of sequencing that needs to be performed should be dictated by the biological question at hand, not by the capabilities of the automation system. Finding a system that can adapt to your needs by accommodating a range of cell types and sequencing chemistries enables you to design your own workflow and answer the questions you want to ask.
Ability to perform positive and negative controls
hallmark of good science and experimental design is running positive and negative controls alongside your samples. Without their inclusion, troubleshooting experiments becomes impossible. Positive controls can confirm that the experimental setup is correct, while negative controls help identify potential contamination that can skew the data. Additionally, negative controls provide a means to determine how much background is being contributed to the data by the experimental system. In an scRNA-seq experiment, the no-cell negative control may show some number of read counts for the gene being analyzed, and this represents the noise in the single-cell automation system. This value can then be set as a confidence threshold for the experimental samples, such that any calls with read counts below this level are excluded from the analysis because they do not represent a true signal.
The large number of cells required for meaningful single-cell analysis can be a major drawback, sexperimentation at this scale is highly susceptible to batch effects. Batch effects are technical sources of variation (e.g., using different lots of reagents for different runs, running experimental groups on different days, having multiple scientists process different runs of an experiment, etc.) that can confound the analysis of biological data. Having the ability to process various experimental groups in parallel during the same run is one key strategy to help minimize the introduction of nonbiological variations. If possible, it is best when the parallel processing also includes biological replicates for each sample group.
Ability to image cells
Integrated imaging allows the identification of true single-cell samples to ensure that the data is not biased by the inclusion of non-single-cell-containing samples such as doublets or empty wells. Even with the most sophisticated single-cell isolation techniques, obtaining 100% single cells is impossible, and probability dictates that some samples will have no cells and others will have multiple cells. Furthermore, a system compatible with fluorescence detection can be used to assess the viability of any identified single-cell samples so that dead cells can be identified and excluded from analysis. Your analysis can be made even more powerful when the sequencing data for the processed cells can be tied back to the imaging data for each sample.
Beyond looking at the system itself, you should also consider what type of support the system's manufacturer can provide. Do they provide just the hardware, or can they also support your sample prep needs? Does the manufacturer provide software solutions to aid in data analysis? Having end-to-end support can dramatically increase the speed of your research project.

There are as many brain cells as there are stars in our galaxy—approximately 100 billion—with each cell possessing a unique function, driven by its unique transcriptional signature. These signatures are, however, lost in traditional bulk RNA-seq experiments, potentially masking the identity of specific cell type(s) that may drive gene expression differences in disease.
To address this challenge, the Allen Institute for Brain Science (AIBS) used our SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input Kit for Sequencing to develop a straightforward workflow for generating transcriptional data from single nuclei derived from human brain tissue.
Separation anxiety: isolating and labeling single nuclei from human brain
Working with postmortem human brain tissue comes with several challenges, most notably the need for rapid preservation of human brain tissue (typically by flash-freezing) to maintain sample quality. Due to the incompatibility of flash-freezing with the isolation of intact cells from postmortem human brain, researchers generated nuclei preparations from cortical (middle temporal gyrus, MTG) and lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) human brain tissue samples. Nuclei were then stained with a PE-conjugated antibody against NeuN—a nuclear-enriched marker specific to neuronal cells and nuclei—and Single-nuclei preps were generated using and (NeuN) signals for FACS.
We go to 11: sequencing of SMART-Seq v4 amplified libraries
Due to the low amount of material in single nuclei, and the SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input Kit for Sequencing's track record for robust and highly sensitive amplification of as little as one cell (10 pg) of total RNA, used our kit to amplify prior to library generation. Following amplification with SMART-Seq v4 and library construction of 1,576 and 15,928 MTG, libraries were sequenced to a depth of ~10 million reads. These libraries passed metrics with flying colors, with a mean of 87% of reads aligning successfully and an average of 28.3% and 38.5% of reads mapping to exons and introns, respectively.
Nuclei were then clustered using principal component analyses followed by nearest-neighbor analysis (Bakken et al. 2017) and categorized into broad cell types (GABAergic interneuron, glutamatergic neuron, astrocyte, microglia, etc.) based on marker gene expression. Broad cell types containing more than one cluster were further subdivided based upon the complement of genes most specific to individual clusters. summary of sequencing metrics by cluster can be seen in Tables 9 and 11 of the protocol .
It pays to be smart: robust and sensitive amplification of ultra-low-input samples
Working with single cells and nuclei for sequencing represents a significant challenge due to extremely small input sizes, but these sample types will only grow in importance as we shift from tissue- to cell-level gene expression profiling. Choosing the right tools for RNA-seq library preparation from single-cell and single-nuclei inputs is crucial to generating reliable data, and this study exemplifies the sensitivity and strength of our SMART-Seq v4 Ultra Low Input Kit for Sequencing .
