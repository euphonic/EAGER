Questions and Answers
What is ASML's vision and mission?
Our vision is a world in which semiconductor technology is everywhere and helps to tackle society’s toughest challenges. We contribute to this goal by creating products and services that let our customers define the patterns that integrated circuits are made of, and we continuously raise the capabilities of our products, enabling our customers to increase the value and reduce the cost of chips.
By helping to make chips cheaper and more powerful, we help to make semiconductor technology more attractive for a larger range of products and services, which in turn enables progress in fields such as healthcare, energy, mobility and entertainment.
What is ASML's role in the industry?
makes the tools for a critical manufacturing step, defining the structures that form the electrical circuits on a chip. By delivering new functionalities, better performance and lower cost with each generation, chips have spawned new products and transformed industries. We are proud to be part of this progress. This is how we enable waves of innovation that help tackle the world’s toughest challenges.
What technology does develop and how does it work?
creates lithography systems. The lithography system filters light through a blueprint of a chip pattern, shrinks the pattern down with optical elements like lenses, and finally prints the pattern on the photosensitive layer of a silicon wafer. When the unwanted silicon is etched away, a three-dimensional structure is revealed. Repeat it hundreds of times in dozens of layers and you are building an integrated circuit, or chip.
Our lithography systems are a hybrid of high-tech hardware and advanced software, used by our customers (the world’s top chipmakers) to mass produce chips in their factories. These systems are modular so we can service, upgrade and continuously improve them. We further enhance system performance and reliability with predictive algorithms, which optimize the blueprint of a chip for the best possible manufacturing result, and with metrology, which analyzes and corrects the chip manufacturing process in real-time.
What is lithography?
Lithography is arguably the most important and critical part of the chip production process. chip is an integrated circuit of billions of transistors that are connected across dozens of layers. Lithography determines how a chip design can be mass produced on silicon, since it defines the size and shape of all chip components, connections and contacts. It is also critically important in making and connecting every layer of the chip.
What is ASML's global presence?
We are a multinational company with offices in 60 cities in 16 countries, headquartered in Veldhoven, the Netherlands. We employ more than 19,000 people on payroll and flexible contracts (expressed in full time equivalents). is traded on Euronext Amsterdam and under the symbol ASML.

When was the company established and what do the letters stand for?
was founded in Eindhoven (the Netherlands) in 1984. It started as a joint venture between two Dutch companies: Royal Philips Electronics and Advanced Semiconductor Materials International (ASMI). It was named Lithography to complement International’s subsidiary companies, which had similar names and served the semiconductor industry. In 1988, International withdrew from the partnership but the company was too young to change names, so it continued as Lithography. After floatation as an independent company, ‘ASML’ became well known and became the official company name, so ‘Lithography’ is no longer used.

Our customers include all of the world's leading chipmakers, like Intel, Samsung, and GlobalFoundries, who use our product portfolio to manufacture a wide range of semiconductor chips.
The heart of ASML’s product portfolio is the semiconductor lithography system. The system works with a light source, which generates ultraviolet light. This light is projected through a blueprint (usually referred to as 
) of a geometric chip pattern. Optics reduce and focus the pattern onto a thin slice of silicon (the 
) that is coated with a light-sensitive chemical. The light interacts with the chemical, effectively printing the pattern onto the wafer. When unwanted silicon is etched away, a three-dimensional structure is revealed. This process is repeated dozens of times, layer upon layer, ultimately creating a grid of hundreds of chips on a single silicon wafer.
Our lithography system is a combination of high-tech hardware and advanced software, affording exact control over the shape and size of the chip patterns it creates. But to create today’s most advanced chips, the patterns and their margins for error are so small that it is no longer sufficient to look at the lithography system in isolation. That is why we enhance system performance and reliability with predictive algorithms (which optimize the blueprint of a chip for lithography) and with metrology (which measure and correct the chip manufacturing process on our systems in real-time). We call the integration of these optimizations for chip manufacturing ’Holistic Lithography’.
Our main customer groups are makers of 
 can store and process large amounts of data on electronic products and are usually classed as volatile or non-volatile. Volatile memories typically lose stored information when power is removed, while non-volatile memories retain their information. The main type of volatile memory is known as (Dynamic Random Access Memory), a low-cost, high-capacity chip that provides electronics with memory to help process information. The main type of non-volatile memory chip is known as Flash, which is used to  store data on electronic devices. Both and Flash chips are made in dedicated memory factories. 
Logic chips
 process information and are the brains of electronic devices. Chipmakers that design and manufacture logic chips are known as IDMs (Integrated Device Manufacturers). Contract manufacturers, known as foundries, produce chips on order for other companies.

In a nutshell
Add to my favorites
In 1984, Philips and Advanced Semiconductor Materials International (ASMI) created a new company to develop lithography systems. Called ASML, we began our days inauspiciously, located in a wooden shed next to a Philips building in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. That same year we launched the 2000 stepper, our first system. By 1985 we grew to 100 employees and moved into futuristic-looking headquarters in nearby Veldhoven. In 1986 we brought the 2500 stepper to market. With its superior alignment technology, it helped to build the reputation of some of today’s leading semiconductor manufacturers. In the same year we established our very close partnership with lens manufacturer Carl Zeiss, which endures today. By 1988 we had begun to make in-roads in the Asian market, after Philips established a joint-venture foundry in Taiwan. In the United States we grew from a few employees to 84, spread over five locations. withdrew from the joint venture and was bought out by Philips.
The 1990s: from helping hand to IPO
In 1991, we launched what turned out to be our breakthrough platform, the 5500, which dramatically reduced manufacturing times for our customers. In 1995, Philips sold its remaining shares and became a fully independent public company, listed on the Amsterdam and stock exchanges. It brought in the capital to fuel our growth further. We expanded our production facilities in Veldhoven. In 2000, we acquired Silicon Valley Group and added Wilton, Connecticut as an R&and manufacturing location.
The 2000s: and immersion pave the way
In 2001, we introduced the system and its revolutionary dual-stage technology. These systems expose one wafer while the next wafer is already being measured, which maximizes the productivity of the system as well as its accuracy, boosting the value of ownership for our customers. In 2007, we shipped the first 
 system (XT:1900i). With this new technology, we enabled our customers to produce even smaller chip features by projecting light through a layer of water between the lens and the wafer.
Later in 2007, we acquired BRION, a leading provider of semiconductor design and manufacturing optimization solutions. This was the start of our ‘Holistic Lithography’ strategy, which expanded ASML’s knowledge of the lithography system with critical expertise to optimize the chip manufacturing before, during and after lithography. BRION’s advanced computational models and R&teams were integrated into our Applications business line. Another key product in the early phase of ASML’s Holistic Lithography strategy was YieldStar, our metrology system which provides real-time measurements and corrections during chip manufacturing. The first YieldStar (250D) was shipped to customers in 2008.
In 2010, we shipped the first prototype Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tool (NXE:3100) to the research facility of an Asian chip maker. Marking the beginning of a new era in lithography, lithography uses light of a shorter wavelength to manufacture smaller chip features, resulting in faster, more powerful chips. To accelerate its development, a Customer Co-Investment Program was developed in 2012 with three of our key customers – Intel, and Samsung. All agreed to contribute to the R&of next-generation lithography technologies over five years, and acquired equity stakes in the company.
, the San Diego-based manufacturer of lithography light sources, to accelerate the development of We shipped the second generation system (NXE:3300) that year, with the third generation system (NXE:3350) following in 2015. lithography turned the corner in 2016, when customer began ordering our first production-ready  system NXE:3400 in batches. This system could manufacture 125 wafers per hour. 
Next to EUV, we continued to improve the performance of our immersion lithography systems. The NXT1970Ci and NXT1980Di, the work horses of the chip industry, were installed in customer factories around the world.
We expanded our Holistic Lithography portfolio in 2016 with the acquisition of Hermes Microvision (HMI), a leading supplier e-beam metrology tools. The joint and effort resulted in the first shipment of the e-beam pattern fidelity metrology system (ePfm5) in 2017. The e-beam metrology complements ASML’s fourth-generation YieldStar 375optical metrology system, which also first shipped in 2017.

Innovation is rarely a straight line. We know it takes strong partnerships, multidisciplinary teamwork and a keen focus on how we can best help our customers. We believe that even the biggest challenge can be overcome by chipping away at it, if necessary with hundreds of people over years. We love the challenges that present themselves when pushing our technology to the next level. And then we persevere to get the job done. Together. 
Open Innovation for better results
The way we work together in our ecosystem of suppliers, partners and customers is something we call ‘Open Innovation’. We are proud of this form of collaboration, which is based on building mutual trust and managed self-interest. It is a belief that has shaped from its earliest years: we have always seen ourselves as architects and integrators, inspiring our partners to innovate on the cutting edge of engineering together, each in their own strength, all the while sharing risk and reward. Open Innovation expands the knowledge and skills of all partners involved, bringing technology to a higher level faster than any one partner could have done alone. 
Sustained R&D, fast engineering cycles
We innovate across our entire product portfolio at the same pace as our customers through large and sustained investment in research and development. To accelerate our product development, we engineer in parallel what may usually happen sequentially, all the while guarding the product’s reliability, manufacturability and serviceability. This enables us to get our innovations into the hands of chipmakers faster. We collaborate closely with chipmakers to understand how our technology best fits their needs, challenges and visions of the future. It is through this collaboration and trust that we can build for today and develop for tomorrow.
Diversity fosters great ideas
The whiteboard is our favorite forum. We sketch our ideas on them, and only the best ones stay put. To get to the best ideas, we question everything while keeping an open, curious mind. We know that a great idea can come from anyone, so we foster a melting pot of different backgrounds, talents and passions. We are proud of that diversity and we know that it makes us stronger. 
We get the job done together
We innovate as one team around the world. We have a strong sense of pride, shared purpose and foster a knowledge-based culture. These are the characteristics that enable us to push the boundaries of technology further and further.

Society is facing an approaching global talent shortage as the job market struggles to keep up with the ever-increasing prevalence of technology. Tech companies play an important role in promoting interest in (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) among school-aged children, the workforce of the future. “We’re All Nerds Now,” reads a  New York Times article  headline from back in 2014. “Never before has the boundary between geek culture and mainstream culture been so porous,” they continue. This is certainly still true today, perhaps even more so. The days of being considered socially awkward or even inferior as a nerd are over. Being a nerd is, frankly, cool.
Three key takeaways from ASML’s Investor Day 2018
On Thursday November 8, 2018, investors and financial analysts from around the world gathered at our headquarters in the to get an update from our executives about ASML’s product portfolio, technology roadmaps and business opportunities — all the way to 2025. With lithography being at the very heart of the semiconductor industry, we have the advantage of longer-term visibility that others in the industry don’t have. Here are three key takeaways from the event. 1. Big trends fuel the semiconductor industry’s fast growth
Introducing the ‘Digital Gold’ Hackathon for developers
Software is what makes ASML’s hardware work. To us, software solutions are pure ‘digital gold’, and recently, we proved it. Earlier this month we brought 37 software developers of 24 different nationalities to our headquarters in Veldhoven to participate in ASML’s first hackathon. The hackathon participants were winners of a  coding challenge  that issued in August in collaboration with the tech platform Codility. In total, 1,295 people participated in the challenge. The prize: trip to the to participate in a two-day hackathon at our headquarters in Veldhoven.
sets RECORDS™ title for the Smallest advertisement
ASML’s lithography machines are used to create microchips on the nanometer scale (that’s a millionth of a millimeter), which in turn enables electronic devices to become cheaper, faster and more powerful. So, it may come as little surprise that has set the RECORDS™ title for the world’s smallest advertisement, created with one of our lithography machines. The world’s smallest advertisement has a surface area of 258 micrometers squared, measuring just 33.27 micrometers x 7.76 micrometers. It would easily be covered by a single strand of human hair, which are about 75 micrometers wide (one micrometer equals a thousandth of a millimeter).
20 years of lithography innovation  acknowledged by European Patent Office
The European Patent Office (EPO) recently recognized the groundbreaking R&undertaken by and its partners over the past 20 years. This article reflects on some of the most notable highlights and one extra-special ‘eureka moment’. Recognition of the innovation came in the form of the  European Inventor Award , Popular Prize 2018. It was presented by the to the two main team leaders at ASML, physicist Vadim Banine and engineer Erik Loopstra. The technology of (extreme ultraviolet) lithography is central to the next generation of systems that will be used to manufacture tomorrow’s microchips, and it represents a major advance in the continued miniaturization of these essential components.
Fellows: giving technical experts the recognition they deserve
If the prospect of becoming a manager doesn’t make you excited, don’t worry; there are other ways to advance your career. At ASML, people can steer clear of the ‘managerial’ track and choose the ‘expert’ or ‘project lead’ tracks instead. In this article, we highlight our two most recent Fellows, a title awarded to experts in our R&department who have made outstanding contributions to our technology.  Take a look at our technical job opportunities at  www.workingatasml.com . Moving forward in your career doesn’t always have to mean becoming a manager. Back in 2012, the Harvard Business Review published an article entitled “ Your Career Needs to Be Horizontal ”, which pointed out the fact that even then, though society has moved away from the traditional ‘career ladder’, most of us still assume that career success is vertical.
Are you soft enough for the job? The future of soft skills in technology
Think you can get away with merely having great ‘hard’ skills in a technical job? Think again. The evidence is adding up: soft skills are becoming  increasingly important  in the workplace. Thanks to accelerating technology, tasks that require hard skills are declining, making soft skills key differentiators for job candidates. Oxbridge Academy, a South African-based online college even goes so far as to claim that  hard skills are useless without soft skills . “While [technical skills] are the skills you’ll list on your CV, today’s employers seek more than this,” they explain.  Another article  relates, “It won’t matter how well you understand or can fix a pipe if no one can relate to you”. In a 2017  report , Deloitte Access Economics predicted that “soft skill intensive occupations will account for two-thirds of all jobs by 2030, compared to half of all jobs in 2000. The number of jobs in soft-skill intensive occupations is expected to grow at 2.5 times the rate of jobs in other occupations.” They cited technology, globalization, and demographic shifts that will change how businesses compete as reasons for this increase.
Calculated risks and dedication paves path toward Fellowship
High honor conferred to Anthony Yen, as one of many achievements in a long career driven toward realizing the volume introduction of lithography; important lessons for eager engineering graduates looking to chart a path toward success The first executive to earn the prestigious title of Fellow, Anthony (Tony) Yen spent more than 30 years driving toward the creation of ever-smaller integrated circuits.
on the home stretch
ASML’s decade-long, dogged pursuit of as the next-generation lithography technology was vindicated in early 2017, when reported customers had placed big batches of orders for systems. Billions of euros worth of orders for systems silenced the skeptics who for years had claimed would never be used to manufacture chips.
The era of ‘Things’ is coming and our industry is enabling it
In today’s connected world, semiconductor chips can help save energy in a  smart thermostat  for your home, are helping you drive  your car , and can reliably monitor your heart rate with  your watch . The ‘Internet of Things’ is expected to connect anywhere from  50 to 200 billion such devices  by 2020. Toni Mesquida Küsters (Senior Director Product Marketing at ASML) explains how these new applications of chip technology are enabled by mature lithography systems. The legendary inventor  Nikola Tesla  might have predicted the rise of the  Internet of Things  (IoT) in 1926 when he said, “When wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth will be converted into a  huge brain , which in fact it is, all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole.”
In a nutshell
is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making equipment. Headquartered in Veldhoven, the Netherlands, employs more than 21,000 people.
