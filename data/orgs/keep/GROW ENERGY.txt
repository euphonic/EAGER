is developing novel technology to produce clean energy, purified water and other vital resources with genetically modified microalgae strains and unique photobioreactor systems.
Our systems generate electrical and thermal for homes and buildings.
Our algae strains are capable of cleansing waste water of pollutants and toxins.
We yield significant quantities of biomass which can be utilized in multiple ways.
Natural Sustainability.
Energy's technology is centered on the concept of using biological processes to address humanity's resource needs of power and water. Verde enables biomass to be grown and combusted to create energy, while Hydral yields electricity and purified water through hydrogen fuel cells, both operating with absolutely no carbon emissions.
Algae biotechnology is an exciting, emerging field of research. Grow's bioreactor and light utilization products make it easy for researchers and organizations to test concepts in the areas of biofuel, bioconcentration, and even space habitat design. Our components are available to order direct through GrowTech, or contact us for custom solutions for your business.
Food for the Future.
At our core, Energy's technology is the most efficient in producing algal biomass in quantity and concentration. Biomass has many applications including production, animal feed, and various industrial manufacturing elements. Algal biomass can even be important for human health, such as Chlorella microalgae which is sold in many popular health food stores.

© 2013 Energy, Inc.  All rights reserved.is a pioneer in the creation of structural bioreactors and self-sustaining, localized production systems - the only systems in the world that clean the air while generating electricity. Our Verde system is designed for existing buildings and homes, utilizing a safe and minimally-invasive combustion process to create electricity. Hydral is being developed for high-density properties and new developments, and eventually individual homes and smaller buildings, as hydrogen fuel-cell technology becomes cheaper and more widely used.
announced today that it is developing a new generation of energy-production systems which utilize algae to produce clean electricity, in a process that naturally cleans the air by consuming carbon dioxide.  The company seeks to introduce a new low-cost alternative to other renewable technology, with the world's first renewable power solution that cleanses the environment of existing pollutants.

Legalis changing the industry.
The world today is powered by innovation, yet despite how much our society has advanced, our infrastructure has remained stagnant.  The world’s needs and dependency on reliable yet polluting resources, such as coal and fossil fuels, has driven our planet to the edge of ecological disaster.  Amazingly enough, despite the undeniable signs of our planet’s deterioration, there are forces that try to repel alternative solutions.  And unfortunately, the leaders in alternative energy, such as solar and wind technologies, are still harmful to the environment to manufacture.
uses proprietary technology, world-class design and state-of-the-art manufacturing processes to create a new method of generating electricity with photo-bioreactors.  We utilize an innovative distribution model driven by revenue-share agreements with our customers.  This approach allows us to maintain the highest levels of customer experience and benefit, where clients enjoy virtually free electricity for their properties.  We believe our operational infrastructure provides us with a competitive advantage compared to traditional utilities and alternative companies.
We plan to debut our first model, Verde, in 2014.  Hydral, our hydrogen-based structural system for high density properties, is planned for release in 2015.
