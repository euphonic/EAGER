Devices’ Transceivers Bring High-Def Video via Existing Vehicle Cable and Connector Infrastructure
Devices, Inc. today announced a transceiver series that enables high-definition (HD) video over existing Unshielded Twisted Pair cables and unshielded connectors. This allow OEMs to upgrade easily from standard-definition cameras to cameras and provide the superior resolution and image quality required for today’s automotive camera applications. The new ADV7990 and ADV7991 transmitters and ADV7380 and ADV7381 receivers use ADI’s Car Camera Bus (C2B™) technology to enable significant savings in weight, bulk, cost, and reduce cable-routing constraints when compared to other automotive link solutions.
View product pages and download data sheets:
Connect with engineers and product experts on EngineerZone®, an online technical support community: https://ez.analog.com
The C2transceivers are defined and designed specifically for automotive applications, which means that along with supporting excellent visual quality over the unshielded infrastructure, significant care was also taken with on-chip EMC/mitigation techniques enabling full compliance to the rigorous industry mandates for EMC, EMI, and robustness. The performance of the innovative cable-compensation design supports 30-meter cable runs with multiple in-line connections for resolutions up to 2 megapixels at 30 Hz or 1 megapixel at 60 Hz.
“C2has proven to be a very cost-effective solution and provides seamless transition from mainstream low-resolution to high-definition cameras, and offers significant value to car manufacturers in reducing cable harness cost and weight,” said Motoki Kanamori, general manager, Advanced Hardware Development Dept., Cockpit Systems Business Unit, Denso Corp.  “Denso is excited to work with and use its C2technology to enable our scalable camera and video-connectivity solutions across vehicle lineups.”
The ADV7990/91 and ADV7380/81 transceivers feature negligible latency along with uncompressed transmission; the bidirectional control channel uses the same cable and thus incurs no additional costs. These support a 75-MHz pixel rate (75 MHz Y, 75 MHz C), “frozen frame” detection while the bidirectional control function supports I2C, interrupt/status and general-purpose I/(GPIO).

Non-Financial Information
This release includes non-financial measures that are not in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles and may be different from non-measures used by other companies.  In addition, these non-measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.
Schedules and of this press release provide the reconciliation of the Company’s historical non-measures to their most comparable measures.
Management uses non-measures internally to evaluate the Company’s operating performance from continuing operations against past periods and to budget and allocate resources in future periods. These non-measures also assist management in evaluating the Company’s core business and trends across different reporting periods on a consistent basis. Management also uses these non-measures as the primary performance measurement when communicating with analysts and investors regarding the Company’s earnings results and outlook and believes that the presentation of these non-measures is useful to investors because it provides investors with the operating results that management uses to manage the Company and enables investors and analysts to evaluate the Company’s core business. Management also believes that the non-liquidity measure free cash flow is useful both internally and to investors because it provides information about the amount of cash generated after capital expenditures that is then available to repay debt obligations, make investments and fund acquisitions, and for certain other activities.
The following item is included in our non-revenue, non-gross margin, non-operating income, non-operating margin, and non-diluted earnings per share:
Acquisition-Related Deferred Revenues: Deferred revenue related to shipments of Linear Technology products by distributors to end customers that were received by the distributors prior to the Company’s acquisition of Linear Technology. Business combination accounting principles require the write down of deferred revenue in conjunction with the acquisition. We included these revenues in our non-measures because they relate to a specific transaction and are reflective of our ongoing financial performance.
The following item is excluded from our non-gross margin, non-operating expenses, non-operating income, non-operating margin, and non-diluted earnings per share:
Acquisition-Related Expenses: Expenses incurred as a result of current and prior period acquisitions and primarily include expenses associated with the fair value adjustments to inventory, property, plant and equipment and amortization of acquisition related intangibles, which include acquired intangibles such as purchased technology and customer relationships. Expenses also include severance payments, equity award accelerations and the fair value adjustment associated with the replacement of share-based awards related to the Linear Technology acquisition. We excluded these costs from our non-measures because they relate to specific transactions and are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance.
The following items are excluded from our non-operating expenses, non-operating income, non-operating margin, and non-diluted earnings per share:
Acquisition-Related Transaction Costs: Costs directly related to the Linear Technology acquisition, including legal, accounting and other professional fees, as well as integration-related costs.  We excluded these costs from our non-measures because they relate to a specific transaction and are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance.
Restructuring-Related Expense: These expenses are incurred in connection with facility closures, consolidation of manufacturing facilities, severance, and other cost reduction efforts.  We excluded these expenses from our non-measures because apart from ongoing expense savings as a result of such items, these expenses and the related tax effects have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
Accelerated Stock-Based Compensation Expense: In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recorded $3.4 million of stock-based compensation expense for one of its former executive officers due to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock units and stock options resulting from a reduction in the requisite service period for each in accordance with the terms of the applicable agreements. This stock-based compensation expense and the related tax effect have no direct correlation to the operation of our business in the future.
The following item is excluded from our non-other expense and non-diluted earnings per share:
Amortization of Deferred Financing Costs: In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company replaced a portion of the bridge financing commitments obtained in connection with the Linear Technology acquisition with proceeds from the issuance of $2.1 billion of senior unsecured notes.  As a result, the Company accelerated $7.2 million of the unamortized bridge financing commitment fees into interest expense.  We excluded these costs from our non-measures because they are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance.
The following items are excluded from our non-provision for income taxes and non-diluted earnings per share:
Tax-Related Items: Tax adjustments associated with the non-items discussed above. Discrete tax items including tax expense or benefit related to prior periods; tax benefits related to the release of a tax reserves for an expired tax years; the release of reserves associated with a favorable ruling on petitions with the Tax Court; tax expense or benefit from changes to state tax valuation allowances; tax expense associated with the remittance of cash held outside of the United States related to the post-acquisition integration of Linear Technology and tax expense related to the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. We excluded these tax-related items from our non-measures because they are not associated with the tax expense on our current operating results.
The following item is excluded from our calculation of adjusted free cash flow for fiscal 2017:
One Time Tax Payment: In the third quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company paid $750 million in income taxes associated with the acquisition of Linear Technology.  These payments were principally related to pre-acquisition liabilities but also included $98 million associated with the remittance of cash held outside of the United States related to the post-acquisition integration of Linear Technology.  We excluded these payments from our adjusted free cash flow measure because they relate to a specific transaction and are not reflective of our ongoing financial performance.
These non-measures have material limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company’s financial results presented in accordance with In addition, the Company’s non-measures may not be comparable to the non-measures reported by other companies.  The Company’s use of non-measures, and the underlying methodology when including or excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that the Company will not, in fact, record such items in future periods.

announces the Power by Linear™ LT8708/-1 , a 98% efficient bidirectional buck-boost switching regulator controller that operates between two batteries that have the same voltage, which are ideal for redundancy in self-driving cars. The LT8708/-1 operates from an input voltage that can be above, below or equal to the output voltage, making it well suited for two each 12V, 24or 48batteries commonly found in electric and hybrid vehicles. It operates between two batteries and prevents system shutdown should one of the batteries fail. The LT8708/-1 can also be used in 48V/12and 48V/24dual battery systems.
The LT8708/-1 operates with a single inductor over a 2.8to 80input voltage range and can produce an output voltage from 1.3to 80V, delivering up to several kilowatts of power depending on the choice of external components and number of phases. It simplifies bidirectional power conversion in battery/capacitor backup systems that need regulation of VOUT, VIN, and/or IOUT, IIN, both in the forward or reverse direction. This device’s six independent forms of regulation allow it to be used in numerous applications.
The LT8708-1 is used in parallel with the LT8708 to add power and phases. The LT8708-1 always operates as a slave to the master LT8708, can be clocked out-of-phase and has the capability to deliver as much power as the master. One or more slaves can be connected to a single master, proportionally increasing power and current capability of the system.
Another application is for an input voltage to power a load, where this same input voltage is used to power a LT8708/-1 circuit that charges a battery or bank of supercapacitors. When the input voltage goes away, the load maintains power without disruption from the battery or supercaps by way of the LT8708’s bidirectional capability.
Forward and reverse current can be monitored and limited for the input and output sides of the converter. All four current limits (forward input, reverse input, forward output and reverse output) can be set independently using four resistors. In combination with the (direction) pin, the chip can be configured to process power from to or from to ideal for automotive, solar, telecom and battery-powered systems.
The LT8708 is available in a 5mm × 8mm QFN-40 package. Three temperature grades are available, with operation from –40 to 125°for the extended and industrial grades and a high temp automotive range of –40°to 150°For more information, visit http://www.analog.com/LT8708 .
