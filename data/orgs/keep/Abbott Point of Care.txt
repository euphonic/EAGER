Through the use portable blood analyzers, testing at the “care” streamlines the diagnostic process and helps ensure patients receive the most effective and efficient when and where it is needed.
testing enables staff to make rapid triage and treatment decisions when diagnosing a patient’s condition or monitoring a treatment response. By simplifying the testing process, clinicians can focus on what matters most—providing effective, quality patient care.
With-patient testing offers benefits that extend beyond the bedside. It allows users to improve efficiencies and productivity; simplify processes and procedures; comply with regulatory and performance mandates; and reduce staff burden by bringing the focus back where it belongs: on the patient.
Recent advances have greatly expanded the capabilities testing systems. In addition to offering a growing menu tests, devices can transmit results wirelessly and in real-time to the patient's electronic medical record for physician review. Some systems have been updated with features designed to help hospitals better manage their testing programs and ensure compliance with changing laboratory regulations.
Rapid turnaround test results is vital to decision-making across a range healthsettings. By having access to key test results on the spot, clinicians gain greater control in evaluating and responding to a patient’s ever-changing condition.
Critical In addition to the obvious benefits to medical staff and patients, there are economic benefits that can result from the adoption a with-patient testing platform. Improved efficiencies and productivity, simplified processes and procedures, as well as decreased specimen packaging and transportation time can lower the total cost care. While up to 70% medical decisions are based on laboratory tests1, they only account for between 3-6% total patient-costs.1,2 Costs testing, compared to core laboratory testing (whether centralized or outsourced), can provide even greater decision-making and greater savings.2
Rapid turnaround times, improved decision times, and time-critical decision-making can result in total savings between 8-20% laboratory costs for facilities that implement testing.2 The savings realized due to the decreased cost waiting for results can be as much as $260(€148) per patient.3 For those that implement testing, waiting can improve by as much as 46 minutes per patient.4
