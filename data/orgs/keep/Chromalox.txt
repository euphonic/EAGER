Edwin Wiegand, a self-taught engineer from Pittsburgh, PA, had always shown an intense curiosity in electrical conductivity. In his makeshift laboratory off his family’s dining room, Wiegand experimented with ways to encapsulate the fragile and sometimes dangerous “open coil” heat technology of the time in a dielectric. This led to his groundbreaking patent in 1915 of a resistance-heating element embedded in an insulating refractory and enclosed in a metal sheath. On this technology, he founded in 1917 and began producing the strip heater for what would become the modern electric clothes iron.
The next few decades were a boom period for as electricity became a part of more homes and manufacturing plants. Heat and controls became integrated into systems, and Edwin Wiegand’s numerous patents found many applications in both the residential and commercial markets.

Steam boilers can produce low quality steam that requires additional superheating of the steam after water vaporization.  Removal of water vapor from a steam system is critical to maintaining performance.  steam superheating systems, coupled with power control, can provide instantaneous drying of process steam while only using the exact amount of power needed.  This results in a steam supply that is both consistent temperature and quality throughout the distribution lines.
• Materials of construction include carbon steel, stainless steel, as well as nickel and specialty alloys.
• Power control adjusts rapidly to flow variations.
• Boilers, superheater, power control panels can all be assembled on a modular skid package.
Electric heating provides the best option for superheating as its power is instantly available, has no emissions, and is precisely controlled to only the demand needed.  All items are manufactured in-house for superior quality and rapid delivery.
• All welding, pressure testing, and certification are performed in accordance with standards. 
• power control can be fully integrated and skid-mounted with the heater for a complete package.
• Engineering design tools include 3AutoCad, Solid Works, and Elite, among others.
• Broadest line third-party certifications available – UL, CSA, ATEX, GOST, INMETRO, IEC, ASME, PED, KOSHA
