Especially, the company set out to differentiate its technology by presenting “Roadmap for All Solid-state Battery Technology,” which is the core of the next-generation battery technologies. The concept of SDI's exhibition at the 2019 Detroit Motor Show is “Charged for Auto 2.0,” which implies a message: batteries of the future vehicles are ready for the Auto 2.0 era. Auto 2.0 is the term first introduced by Goldman Sachs in 2017, representing an era of self-driving, electrified vehicles, hyper-connectivity, and vehicle sharing. The exhibition consists of three concepts: 1. (Future Mobility Platform), 2 (Mass & Prestige of Electric Vehicles), and 3. (Enhancing Efficiency of Internal Combustion Engine).   has concentrated on differentiating its technology by introducing products that incorporate products where innovative materials and designs are applied as well as battery cells capable of running at 600 km and a lineup of battery cells of various generations - from 37Ah (ampere-hour) to 78Ah - that can apply to and PHEV. There are two main concerns arisen in the automobile industry when it comes to the popularization of the That is, increasing the driving range through enhanced energy density and lowering the prices of electric vehicles. The new products introduced by are expected to significantly reduce the number of cells per vehicle, which can greatly increase the energy capacity, and therefore help automakers with cost innovation.   introduced a roadmap for all solid-state battery technology as next-generation batteries and exhibited various innovative products including an advanced (Low Voltage System) pack. Electrolyte, one of the four major battery materials (anode, cathode, electrolyte, and separation membrane), in all solid-state batteries is solid, not liquid, which ensures the highest safety and mileage of over 700km with a single charge. Jun Young-hyun mentioned, "The battery has come to the center of the shift of automobile paradigm based on the concepts of electrified vehicles, self-driving, and hyper-connectivity." He added, "will bring forward the Auto 2.0 era and lead the market through various differentiated technologies and continuous innovation.”​

Its collaboration with renowned for number one battery technology and excellent safety is expected to draw a lot of attention to Harley Davidson's forthcoming electric motorcycle. The motorcycle manufacturer’s first all-electric motorcycle started with “Project Livewire” in 2014, and after 4 years of collaborating with SDI, “LiveWire” was created. Harley Davidson acknowledged the solid structure as well as innovative and stable pack design of SDI’s prismatic battery.   Harley-Davidson held a driving event in 2014. As concerns arose about the driving range, it began a full-scale electric motorcycle development. Through constant technical collaboration with SDI, the range has increased to 110 miles (approximately 180 km), nearly twice as high as the first model, which had single-charge mileage of 60 miles (approximately 97 km). LiveWire features not only improved driving range but also zero-back (100 km/h reaching time) of 3.5 seconds, as well as enhanced connectivity which allows riders to share information and to track location. Also, the original roaring engine sound changed to distinctive high-speed driving sound of Harley-Davidson.   is firmly leading the battery market by expanding (Electric Vehicle) applications not only for electric cars but also for electric motorcycles through cooperation with Harley Davidson. Marc McAllister, Vice President of Harley Davidson said, "The world is at the crossroad of transportation evolution and Harley Davidson is at the forefront. Innovation that moves souls and bodies is at the heart of our brand. Our next step is to create products and opportunities for all ages and all walks of life.” Kim Jeong-wook, Executive Vice President of SDI, mentioned, " It’s very meaningful to diversify the battery supply chain for applications from electric cars to electric motorcycles." He added, "Batteries are the driving force of continuous innovation in transportation. Our differentiated battery technology and products will lead the innovation." 
targeting market with new residential m..

To use the power generated by the photovoltaic generator at home, a current conversion process is required, which causes power loss.  In this process, the higher the voltage of the holds, the lower the energy loss occurs, which leads to higher efficiency.   SDI’s 'high-voltage residential module' has been evaluated to have evolved by twice the energy density compared to the products released last year. It is the cell & module design technology that enables a significant increase in energy density just in a year. Without changing the size of battery cell applied to the 'high-voltage residential module,' enlarged its capacity by more than 20% through innovation of internal materials and optimized the module design to double the energy density.  The residential market is growing steadily, centering on the European market, where solar and other renewable energy supply is high. Market research agency B3 forecasts that the residential market will be 1,259MWh (megawatt hours) this year and 1,889MWh in 2020, growing at an average annual rate of 15%. Executive Vice President Kim Jeong-wook representing Strategic Marketing Office said, "has been attracting global customers by introducing innovative battery products each year.

would like all the raw materials used in our products to be extracted, processed, and procured responsibly. To this end, issues the "Report of Responsible Cobalt Supply Chain," setting a precedent for a battery manufacturer. The main goal is to receive as much feedback as possible on how things could be improved. Nevertheless, having an impact as a company alone would be a mission “Impossible”: the complexity (upstream and downstream), and the resources required would be unbearable. We have therefore come to the realization that we can tackle this problem only with the support of our customers, investors, suppliers, partners, employees, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Congo, civil societies and not least the affected local communities. This is why we fully support existing and guidance, as well as “Responsible Cobalt Initiative,” to set new standards in the cobalt supply chain in the spirit of transparency, accountability and clear policy among as many interested like-minded participants as possible.
5-step framework for companies upstream and downstream
Company Policy & Management System/Risk Assessment/Risk Response/Audit/Report
Company Policy &
Management System
Company Policy & Management SystemAdopt company policy for the supply chain of minerals and establish strong company management systems
Risk AssessmentIdentify and assess risk related to factual circumstances in the supply chain against policy standards
Risk ResponseDevise and adopt risk management plan in relation to policy and assessment, including risk mitigation measures
AuditProvide for third-party audit of supply chain due diligence at identified points with third party verification
ReportPublicly report on supply chain due diligence practices in sustainability, CSR, or annual reports

Please support our efforts in responsible cobalt mineral supply chain and let us know if have any opinion upon "Report of Responsible Cobalt Supply Chain," contact us via e-mail: cobalt@samsung.We have also sponsored an independent academic research project that was conducted by Berkeley/(Center for Effective Global Action) . The research project aims to provide rigorous empirical data on households engaged in artisanal mining, and it involves collecting survey data from households, children, village leaders, and local mineral traders in 150 communities that are representative and cover the full geographical extent of the Copper Belt. The study provides evidence on the prevalence, the forms, and on the root causes of child labor in artisanal mining in the region.
We hope the report will be useful to all the stakeholders and help the government, as well as companies, engage on and address the challenges of responsible cobalt mining in a measurable and sustainable manner.

To create true eco-values, the company needs to inclusively control every process related to the management and make green partnerships with the environment, partners, customers, and the society. For the environment, in particular, the company has to take less from it and emit less as well. On the other hand, the company has to more cooperate and exchange with its partners, customers, and the society. This is the direction that is heading in pursuit of environmental sustainability.
