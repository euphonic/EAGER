The elimination of hazardous materials from products is a global initiative, with each region or country imposing its own legislation to eliminate these harmful substances from the environment.
The European Union passed the "Restriction on Use of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment," or "RoHS" legislation 2002/95/EC, which became effective July 1, 2006 and RoRecast 2011/65/of 8 June 2011 and its amendment Directive (EU) 2015/863 officially released on 31 March 2015.
People's Republic of China enforced "Management Methods of Controlling Pollution Caused By Electronic Information Products", Ministry of Information Industry order #39 on 1 March 2007, which is revised to Order no 32 that became effective 1 July 2016.
The transition to lead-free products is a complex task that affects all electronics component suppliers and poses many supply chain, handling and reliability challenges. It involves the replacement of materials used in solder finishes and printed circuit board assembly with non-lead-based material.
offers a broad portfolio of RoHS-compliant products.  The use of new non-lead-based processes and materials make them fully compliant with the requirements of the Rodirective. Rigorous testing procedures ensure the performance integrity of Broadcom's portfolio of products; regardless of the materials and processes employed.
