To reinforce our corporate governance, will build a structure for utilizing to the maximum the worldwide resources possesses, strengthen our business and technological bases, and put in place a framework that will enable us to establish earning power at a global level.
Moreover, believes that continuing to be a company replete with dreams and vitality will form the foundation that will support the motivation of our employees and the sustainable growth of has established the Corporate Governance Guidelines that provide a governance framework that will contribute to the achievement of this aspiration.
The Corporate Governance Framework
uses the Audit & Supervisory Board System, which consists of a Board of Directors and an Audit & Supervisory Board. Effective governance is achieved based on the supervision of management by the Audit & Supervisory Board.
Based on this organizational structure, has also established systems that will facilitate Growth-Oriented governance directed at sustainable growth for TEL, including the following:
・The Board of Directors, whose role is to make major operational decisions and play a supervisory role in the execution of those
・The Nomination Committee and Compensation Committee to ensure fair, effective, and transparent management
・The Corporate Senior Staff (CSS) as the body that formulates and advances company strategy
Six out of the 17 participants in the Board of Directors, including Audit & Supervisory Board Members, are outside members, consisting of three Independent Directors and three Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members. Stating their unreserved opinions from an independent perspective, Independent Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members guide Board of Directors debates in the proper direction for success in global competition that does not follow the same line of discussion proposed by internal Corporate Directors. regards the active statement of opinions, not only by Independent Directors, but also by Audit & Supervisory Board Members, as the cornerstone that supports the best decisions by the Board of Directors. believes that the current Board of Directors has achieved an appropriate sense of tension and constructive debate from the combination of Executive Directors essential for making operational decisions and the objectivity provided by outside members.
makes decisions the independence of Independent Directors and Independent Audit & Supervisory Board Members based on TEL's criteria for judging independence, "Independence Requirements for Outside Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members"; these criteria that were established based on the requirements for Independent Standards set forth by the Stock Exchange.

				The history of semiconductors started in 1947 with the invention of the transistor, and has already passed its 70th-year milestone. Along with the advancement of semiconductors, remarkable improvements in social productivity and standards of living took place throughout the world. The increasingly popular Internet of Things (IoT) technology is enabling everything to be connected via the internet, ushering in the age of big data. We are already seeing the emergence of big data application and service industries backed by such technologies as artificial intelligence (AI), virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR), which in turn require further advancements in semiconductor technology to support faster processing of massive data using less power. (TEL)’s semiconductor production equipment and flat panel display (FPD) production equipment, which forms the foundation for these new industries, also serves as their core technologies that support innovations and enable the evolution of wide-ranging electronic devices.
In anticipation of the continuing growth in the semiconductor and semiconductor production equipment markets, developed a new financial model in May 2018 with the goal of attaining above-the-market growth rates in sales and profits. Upholding the vision of becoming “truly global company generating high added value and profits in the semiconductor and flat panel display industries through innovative technologies and groundbreaking proactive solutions that integrate diverse technologies,” the group is highly motivated and dedicated to the pursuit of continued growth while seeking to maximize its business value. In keeping with the trust and expectations of the stakeholders, is determined to maintain and reinforce its transparent management practices in order to contribute to both industry and society. We appreciate your continued support for and look forward to sharing a brighter future with you.

Compliance/Code of Ethics
The Group acts in strict compliance with business ethics and applicable laws to ensure that its corporate activities are fair and trustworthy.
Business Ethics and Compliance
Stakeholder trust is the cornerstone of business activities. In order to maintain trust, it is necessary to continuously act in rigorous conformity to business ethics and compliance. In line with the Fundamental Policies concerning Internal Controls within the Group, all Group executives and employees are required to maintain high standards of ethics and to act with a clear awareness of compliance.
In 1998, formulated the Code of Ethics of the Group as a set of uniform standards to govern all of its global business activities. In the same year, the Company appointed a Chief Business Ethics Director and established the Ethics Committee, which is responsible for promoting business ethics awareness throughout the Group. The Ethics Committee comprises the Chief Business Ethics Director, the Ethics Committee Chairman, and presidents of major Group companies in and outside Japan. The members meet semiannually, report on ethicsrelated issues facing each company, and discuss measures to further improve ethical behavior and compliance.
The Code of Ethics is reviewed in response to changes in the expectations of society. In January 2015, an anti-corruption statement was added to its introduction based on Principle 10 of the Global Compact, which concerns working against corruption including extortion and bribery. In August 2016, the Group revised the Code of Ethics in light of the Code of Conduct of the RBA®* and broader social changes.
The Group’s Code of Ethics and its Q&section are published in Japanese, English, Korean and Chinese and disclosed on the intranet to enable all Group executives and employees, including those overseas, to view them at any time. The Code of Ethics is also publicly accessible from the corporate website.
has appointed a Compliance & Internal Control Executive Officer from among its executive officers to raise awareness of compliance across the Group and further improve Group-wide compliance. Each Group company has also drawn up its own compliance regulations, setting out basic compliance-related requirements in line with the Code of Ethics. The compliance regulations are intended to ensure that all individuals who take part in the business activities of the Group clearly understand the pertinent laws and regulations, international standards and internal company rules, and consistently apply these rules in all of their activities.
Compliance Education
Through the Group’s e-learning system, we provide web-based training programs covering the basics of compliance, exportrelated compliance, protection of personal information, the Act for Subcontracting and other topics. All executives and employees are required to complete these programs. In addition, other web-based programs tailored to specific positions and job roles are also available, including those on insider trading and the Social Security and Tax Number System. 
We also have a quiz-based business ethics and compliance education course, launched in fiscal 2014, for all Group executives and employees. Updated yearly, the quiz is intended to maintain compliance awareness throughout the Group and disseminate the latest information.
In addition to these web-based courses, we organized inhouse seminars in fiscal 2017 for Corporate Directors and executive officers on the subjects of compliance and internal control.
Internal Reporting System
The Group has an internal reporting system that employees can use to report any activity suspected of being in breach of laws, regulations or business ethics. An ethics hotline and a compliance hotline have been established to receive reports from all Group companies, and each overseas location also has its own reporting system. In all instances, the system ensures that whistleblowers remain anonymous and are protected from any disadvantage or repercussions.
There were no reports or cases of non-compliance with laws, regulations, or principles of ethics in fiscal 2017 that could have had a material impact on the Group’s business or local communities.
Confirming of Information on Japanese Laws
In order to reduce the risk of legal compliance violations, we regularly identify and clarify the Japanese laws that affect company operations and regulations. Information regarding revisions to relevant laws is received in a timely manner via an external Web service and appropriate responses are taken, such as amending internal regulations, changing operational procedures, and notifying all personnel affected by the revisions.

In order to enhance the Group’s corporate value and remain accountable for our actions to our stakeholders, we are making efforts to strengthen effective internal control. This involves implementing practical measures that are in line with the Fundamental Policies concerning Internal Controls within the Group, set out by Electron’s Board of Directors. We are also annually evaluating our internal control over financial reporting based on the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan.
Risk Management System
To more effectively strengthen the risk management systems of the entire Group, has established a dedicated risk management unit within the General Affairs Department of the corporate headquarters. This function analyzes the risks faced by the Group and identifies material risks. It then monitors the management of such risks while supporting and implementing risk management activities. The function also regularly reports the status of risk management activities to the Audit & Supervisory Board Members and the Board of Directors.
In fiscal 2017, the Group reassessed the material risks in its operating environment. For each risk determined to be material, the status of risk management at the responsible divisions was reconfirmed. Going forward, the Group will continue these initiatives to enhance the efficacy of its risk management framework.
Auditing by the Internal Audit Department
The Global Audit Center of the corporate headquarters is the Group’s internal audit department. This Center is responsible for auditing business activities, compliance and systems at domestic and overseas Group companies and business units (BUs) in accordance with each fiscal year’s auditing plan. The Center also annually evaluates the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control over financial reporting based on the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan.
At operating divisions where issues have been identified through audits and assessments, the Center monitors progress and provides necessary guidance for improvement.

Business Continuity Plans (BCPs)
The Group began building business continuity plans in 2003. After the Great East Japan Earthquake, the Group rebuilt these plans to be more effective and include provisions for restoring operations after crises, focusing on major business sites. As examples of specific initiatives, the Group has put considerable effort into such preparations for disasters as stockpiling emergency supplies (including food and drinking water), reinforcing essential infrastructure, rebuilding the safety confirmation system, creating manuals, and implementing drills and employee training.
Furthermore, to meet its responsibilities as an equipment manufacturer, the Group pursues ongoing efforts to improve its BCPs, including taking steps to facilitate early recovery and alternate production.
And also, following the experience of the Kumamoto Earthquake, reinforcement work is being conducted for buildings at bases in Japan to improve their seismic resistance.
Information Security Management
To ensure the appropriate management of information assets, the Group has an information management framework centered on its Information Security Committee, which is composed of representatives from departments across the Group.
The Information Security Committee acts as a decision-making body for the Group. Rules concerning the handling and protection of such sensitive information as trade secrets and personal information are formulated based on the committee’s policy and applied throughout the Group. An e-learning system is used to educate and promote awareness of these rules among Group employees and executives.
Additionally, the Group has a reporting system for both actual and potential cases (incidents) of information leakage. Reported incidents are quickly settled and then analyzed. Based on such analyses, recurrence prevention measures are implemented throughout the Group.
In order to mitigate emerging cyber security threats, the Group examines and undertakes rational countermeasures as necessary. The Group also has in place systems to detect targeted threats that utilize social engineering as well as a supervisory framework to prevent damage.
The ever-accelerating evolution of semiconductors
The key inventions that laid the foundation of today's information technology (IT) had already emerged by the end of the 19th century, including the light bulb by Thomas Alva Edison, telephone and telegraph by Alexander Graham Bell, wireless telegraphy by Guglielmo Marconi, and cathode ray tube by Karl Ferdinand Braun. These basic technologies have made remarkable progress since then, due in large part to the development of semiconductors.
Let us trace the evolution of the semiconductor through the history of epoch-making discoveries and inventions, starting with the birth of the vacuum tube—a distant ancestor of semiconductor devices.
1904: Two-electrode vacuum tube is invented
Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of the first practical incandescent light bulb, had also noticed that the direct electric current flowed from a heated metal filament in the bulb to the other electrode only when the latter had a positive voltage. John Ambrose Fleming used this effect (known as the Edison effect) to invent the two-electrode vacuum tube rectifier, which was soon to play an important role in the electrical circuits.

1946: World's first general-purpose computer is announced
was the largest electronic machine ever made, equipped with some 18,000 vacuum tubes and weighing about 30 tons. It occupied a 160-square-meter room.
The computer consisted of a total of about 110,000 electronic circuit devices.
In contrast, today's microprocessor typically integrates tens of millions of transistors and yet is smaller than the palm of your hand. This astonishing decrease in size started when solid state semiconductors replaced vacuum tubes.
1948: Junction-type transistor is invented
Toward the end of 1947, John Bardeen and Walter Brattain at AT&Bell Labs developed the point contact transistor, which was the first transistor ever constructed. William Shockley and his team continued with this research, and announced the invention of the mechanically solid junction-type transistor in June 1948.
Subsequently, integrated circuits (ICs) were invented that packed large numbers of transistors into a small chip, followed by large-scale integrated circuits (LSIs) with an integration level of 1,000-100,000 components or more on a chip.

Early broadcast radio receivers used vacuum tubes. By replacing vacuum tubes with semiconductor transistor devices, radios became smaller, lighter, and less power consuming. Tsushin Kogyo (Telecommunications Engineering Corporation; now Sony) released Japan's first transistor radio TR-55 in 1955. While attempting to improve the yield of a transistor manufacturing process, the company's research team discovered the quantum mechanical effect known as tunneling.

While pursuing a research project for creating faster transistors, Leo Esaki made an artificial structure consisting of two layers of different semiconductor materials separated by a thin dielectric layer of 10 nm or less, and discovered that the tunneling effect occurs within this structure.
The first electronic device that applied this effect was the Esaki diode, which became a major springboard for subsequent development of LSIs.

1959: Kilby patent is filed
The Kilby patent refers to the patent on the basic concept of the integrated circuit developed by Jack St. Kilby at Texas Instruments (TI). The far-reaching patent yielded huge royalties to Because Japan had originally delayed granting this patent for many years, its expiration date in Japan was as late as in 2001. As a result, Japanese semiconductor manufacturers were charged with large amounts of licensing fees for some of their products.

1965: Moore's law is announced
In 1965, Gordon Moore (who later became a co-founder of Intel) predicted that the integration rate of LSIs would double every 18 months, implying that it would quadruple in three years and become 1,000-fold denser in 15 years. The prediction, known as Moore's law, was based on the analysis of historical trends in the computer manufacturing industry. The proposition was widely accepted in the semiconductor and computer industries, and the reality turned out to be almost exactly as Moore had foreseen.
1971: Intel 4004 is released
Intel 4004 was the world's first single chip microprocessor. It was originally developed on the request of Busicom Corporation in Japan as an for its electronic calculator. Intel's Ted Hoff proposed the idea of universal logic processor, which was taken up by Masatoshi Shima at Busicom and Federico Faggin at Intel who completed the chip design. Attracted by the potential versatility of this chip, Intel obtained the sales rights to the product.
1977: World's first personal computer Apple is released
Although many consider the Altair 8800 to be the world's first personal computer, its manufacturer called it a minicomputer along with other designations such as microcomputer and home computer. In contrast, Apple's Steve Jobs used the term "personal computer," which took hold with the commercial success of the Apple II.

1980: Flash memory is invented
Flash memory is a rewritable semiconductor memory device that is non-volatile (i.e., it retains the information when power is turned off). Unlike previous rewritable memory that could only erase the information one byte at a time, flash memory was designed to erase the entire block of data at once, and to reduce the cost per bit by 75% or more.
Flash memory was invented in 1980 by Fujio Masuoka (then a Toshiba employee). Today, flash memory is found in personal computers, mobile phones, digital cameras, cards, and many other applications that we use every day.

1983: Family Computer is released
The advancement in semiconductor technology has revolutionized family entertainment as well. In 1983, Nintendo released a video game console fitted with an 8-bit The Family Computer (Famicom) became a smash hit on the back of the popularity of Super Mario Bros., a game developed by Nintendo for this platform. Encouraged by Famicom's success, the company released a 16-bit game console known as Super Famicom in 1990.
The video game market thrived as palm-sized mobile platforms and other variations also entered the fray, and the consoles have become more advanced than ever.

1991: Carbon nanotube is discovered
The evolution of the semiconductor can no longer be discussed without referring to the advancement in nanotechnology. The discovery of the carbon nanotube by Sumio Iijima in 1991 was a pivotal event in this field.
Carbon nanotubes have many excellent properties, including over 1,000 times greater electric current density and 10 times better room-temperature thermal conductivity than copper. That makes carbon nanotubes a promising successor to silicon as semiconductor scaling continues.

1993: First practical blue developed
Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been considered ideal for making display panels, as they consume very small power to produce light. The application required three primary colors (red, green, and blue), however, and there had been no practical technology to manufacture blue until 1993, when Nichia Corporation and Shuji Nakamura developed the blue technology. Their achievement made full color displays possible, as well as the blue laser technology that enabled advanced recorders and other applications.

2002: Earth Simulator records world's fastest processing speed of 35.86 TFLOPS
The Earth Simulator was a highly parallel vector supercomputer built under the auspices of the then Science and Technology Agency. Designed to study global climate change and the mechanism of strata shifting and diastrophism, the Earth Simulator set the world record performance of 35.86 running the benchmark in June 2002. The performance, equivalent to about 36 trillions of floating-point operations per second, was almost five times higher than the runner-up—the White system. The Earth Simulator maintained the top position on the TOP500 list for about three years.
The defeat was dubbed the Computnik crisis in the U.S., as it was reminiscent of the shocking success of the Soviet satellite Sputnik. Determined to push back, the government set up a national supercomputer project and regained the top spot in three years.

2004: Graphene creation experiments prove successful
Graphene, or an atomic-scale sheet of carbon atoms, is attracting attention as a high-performance semiconductor material that could one day replace silicon. Its existence was predicted as early as in the 1940s, but it was much later that graphene was isolated. In 2004, Andre Geim and Konstantin Novoselov applied clear adhesive tape to a block of graphite, cleaving a thin layer of graphene.
Graphene is expected to enable highly efficient solar cells, very sensitive touch panels, and many other useful applications.
