2010—Today: The Integration of Our History
1870s-1910s: An early passion 
The world’s first well logging company had its origins in the Alsace region on the French-German border, where Conrad (born 1878) and his brother Marcel (born 1884) grew up as part of a family of six children. Their father, Paul Schlumberger, was descended from a wealthy cotton-weaving family; their mother, Marguerite de Witt, was a political activist and campaigner for women’s rights. 
Conrad and Marcel both wanted to be scientists and their father supported their ambition. The brothers were sent to Paris to further their education. Conrad became a physicist, graduating from the École Polytechnique in 1900, before studying at the École des Mines. Marcel became an engineer, graduating from the École Centrale Paris in 1907.
Conrad took an early interest in earth sciences and developed a particular interest in prospecting for metal ore. He realized that metal ores should be distinguishable from their surroundings by measuring their electrical conductivity, as ore-bearing rock would be more conductive than what was around it. If an electric field could be generated below ground, voltage measurements at the surface could be mapped to show lines of equal potential—equipotential curves—which could then be compared with what would be expected if no ore were present. Any differences could indicate the presence of mineral deposits.
Now, he needed to put the theory to the test.
In 1910, Conrad began teaching physics at the École des Mines, where, the following year, he started tests on what was to become known as wireline logging, first in the lab and then out in the field. 
In 1912, using very basic equipment, he recorded the first map of equipotential curves at his estate near Caen in Normandy, before extending his surveys to iron mines in the area. The resulting mapping of equipotential curves not only confirmed the method’s ability to detect metal ores but also revealed features of the subsurface structure, such as bed boundaries and the direction of formation layer dips. 
That Schlumberger’s technique could provide this extra information was highly significant, as it meant that it might be useful for locating subsurface structures that could form traps for minerals such as oil and gas.
However, progress was severely disrupted by World War Conrad served as an artillery officer from 1914-18, before returning to his research.
He received strong support for his work from his family. In 1919, his brother Marcel began working as a partner with Conrad, initially in Normandy.  Meanwhile, their father, Paul, provided them with fresh funds to take the research further—on the condition that scientific gains must take precedent over financial benefits.
However, Conrad had long been aware of the business potential of his research and had patented his discoveries in several countries, while studying how his electrical prospecting method could be turned into an industrial application.
The next decade saw that commercial potential starting to be realized.

Management System
The Management System defines the principles by which we conduct our operations worldwide with regards to health, safety, and the environment.
Management communicates the philosophy to all employees, customers, contractors, and third parties associated with our business, and each organization must provide positive evidence of conformance to the system.
The Management System model comprises eight interrelated components: 
commitment and leadership and accountability 
policies and objectives 
organization and resources 
contractor and supplier management 
business processes 
performance monitoring and improvement 
These are continuously improved by conformance checks 
on day-to-day standards and procedures (controls) 
on the management system (correction) 
through modifications to the management system (improvement).

The search for oil and gas has three objectives: to identify and evaluate hydrocarbon-bearing reservoirs; to bring hydrocarbons to the surface safely and cost-effectively, without harming the environment; and to maximize the yield from each discovery. These objectives can be advanced only by ongoing research into all aspects of the exploration, drilling, and production processes.
Since it first established a research laboratory in 1948 in Ridgefield, Connecticut, USA, has maintained an unwavering, long-term commitment to research. research has grown geographically and in its range of disciplines into a global network of research centers, expressly to tap into the astonishing breadth and diversity of innovation in the 21st century.
In 2007, the Ridgefield lab, renamed Schlumberger-Doll Research in 1965, moved to a new facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, one of six research labs worldwide. Cambridge Research opened in 1982 near the campus of Cambridge University in the UK; Moscow Research and Stavanger Research opened in their eponymous cities in the mid-1990s. The company’s two newest research labs are the Dhahran Carbonate Research Center, opened in 2006 near the campus of King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Saudi Arabia, and Brazil Research and Geoengineering Center, which opened in 2010 on the campus of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. 
Our research is often conducted in partnership with universities and customers around the world. This ensures close contact with leading-edge research in all relevant disciplines, improves understanding of clients' challenges, and facilitates the validation of research ideas in field experiments at an early stage in the product development cycle.

spate of acquisitions led to further restructuring of subsidiaries. The purchase of the drilling rig company and 50% of Dowell of North America in 1984 led to the creation of Anadrill (a combination of Dowell and The Analysts' drilling segments) and the Forex Drilling Company (a merger of with Forex Neptune). Meanwhile, the acquisition of 50% of in 1985 signaled the start of a long-term commitment to the seismic measuring sector. bought the remaining 50% of in 1988. 
Other strategic moves during the decade included the merger of Flopetrol with Wireline group to create Wireline & Testing, and the acquisitions of Neptune (North America), Bosco and Cori (Italy), and Allmess (Germany).
The company’s first measurements-while-drilling (MWD) job was completed in 1980, in the Gulf of Mexico, combining elements of wireline logging with real-time data transmission. The early 1980s was also the period when nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging—under development since the 1960s—finally became practical, enabling more comprehensive understanding of reservoirs. The Crystal graphical log interpretation workstation, which ultimately became the basis for GeoFrame software, was also developed at this time. The first logging-while-drilling (LWD) tool was introduced in 1988, measuring formation properties before exposure to drilling fluids took its toll
The company's commitment to developing a global research network led to the opening of its Cambridge Research Center in England in 1983, focusing on drilling technology, fluids, seismic techniques, production logging and rock mechanics. The Fuchinobe engineering center in Japan was opened in 1985.
This global research drive was complemented by pioneering use of computer connectivity to bring Schlumberger’s widely spread operations together. In 1981, the company implemented its first international data links with e-mail. Two years later as one of the first commercial users of ARPANet, the precursor to the Internet, the company’s Palo Alto lab was implemented for multiple international links and the first internal secure gateway between divisions was established.
In 1985, the company deployed the Information Network (SINet), the world's second largest internal corporate network and the first commercial ARPANet-based intranet. Before the end of the decade, registered the Internet domain name slb.com.
Following the death of Jean Riboud and the year-long tenure of his successor Michel Vaillaud, Euan Baird was appointed chairman and chief operating officer of Limited in 1986. Baird, a Scot, became the first non-French holder of these positions. 
In the aftermath of the 1986 oil price collapse and the associated oil glut, which had adversely affected global exploration, Baird led the company’s successful refocusing of its business on its core oilfield services and measurements activities and placed a greater emphasis on R&that would lead to the development of a host of new products.

2010—Today: The Integration of 1970s: The Exploration Boom
Timeline: 1970-1979
Growing computer power and engineering sophistication enabled the development of a host of new complex applications, designed to improve accuracy and save the customer time and energy. The advantage provided by its unparalleled range of tools reinforced as the market leader, and that meant the company was in prime position to benefit from the upsurge in worldwide oil exploration triggered by the oil embargo of 1973.
Computerized log interpretation began in 1970. The program integrated all existing log measurements used to measure the volume of clay minerals in the rock and calculate fluid saturations. While was designed for analyzing shaly sands, its sister application was developed to deal with multi-mineral lithology.  
In 1971, the “triple combo” logging tool was introduced, reducing operating time and risk for the customer by providing gamma ray, spontaneous potential, resistivity, neutron, density and caliper measurements in one piece of equipment.   
Log data could now be transmitted from the field not only by phone, but also by satellite. The first logging truck equipped with a computer entered the field in 1977 as part of the Cyber Service Unit (CSU). In 1975, joined ARPAnet, the computer-based research network created by the Department of Defense that would later develop into the Internet.
In the latter part of the decade, introduced the tool, a first-generation digital sonic tool for uphole processing of compressional and shear sound speeds in formations. Also getting under way then was research on the company’s Accelerator Porosity Tool (APT), a multi-detector neutron tool with pulsed neutron source, which measures slowing-down time. In 1979, the first observation of the propagating slow wave, a long-predicted feature of the acoustics of porous media, prepared the ground for applications that could eliminate unwanted signals.
Strategic acquisitions included that of Flopetrol, a specialist in testing oil well production, in 1971. bought the 50% of Forex it did not already own and created the Forex Neptune Drilling Company in the same year. The Analysts, a directional drilling and mud logging services provider, was acquired in 1977, paving the way for success in the fast-expanding measurements-while-drilling sector.

2010—Today: The Integration of 1960s: From the Ocean Depths to the Moon
By now, developments were finding valuable uses well beyond its core hydrocarbons and minerals activities. The company’s growing expertise in deep-sea drilling helped illuminate the ocean floor for scientific explorers. Its  equipment was also useful in the search for sunken vessels—notably the submarine Thresher, which was lost off Cape Cod, Massachusetts in 1963. provided an electrode able to detect spontaneous potential—the electricity generated by metal immersed in water—which indicated the location of the vessel on the seabed.
was also used in another realm entirely.  The spacecraft that evolved throughout the “space race” decade of the 1960s, which culminated in the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969, needed precisely the sort of remote sensing and accurate measuring equipment that was pioneering. The company provided high-reliability calculating machines to in the early 1960s and still provides sensors for space exploration today.  
Meanwhile, progress in the company’s core businesses continued apace. Throughout the 1960s, engineers developed density logs to improve understanding of lithology and porosity, saturation measurements through casing, computer-processed dipmeter logs, digital tape processing in a logging truck, and sonic logging. engineering center in Clamart, France was founded in 1965.
The company also grew steadily through acquisitions and partnerships. In 1960, it formed Dowell Schlumberger, a 50/50 joint venture with Dow Chemical, which specialized in pumping services for the oil industry. In 1961, Solartron, a electrical instrumentation company was acquired, and in the same year, Société d'Instrumentation was founded to coordinate expansion into electronics and measurement systems. In 1962, the company acquired the cable operations of Vector Cable and Daystrom measurement instruments. In 1964, created the Neptune drilling company by merging parts of its Languedocienne operation with Forex, of which it owned 50% at the time.
The growing company also required improved access to funding, prompting the listing of Limited on the New York Stock Exchange in 1962.
Significant personnel changes included the appointment of Jean Riboud as chairman of the board and chief executive officer of Limited in 1966, and the retirement of Henri Doll in 1967, after an illustrious career. The Ridgefield research facility was renamed the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center in his honor.
Doll’s research and expertise had helped ensure the company was well prepared to face a range of new challenges emerging by the end of the 1960s, as the wells to be logged got deeper than 20,000 feet and exploration moved into tricky environments, such as Alaska.

2010—Today: The Integration of 1950s: New Technology, Strategic Acquisitions
Electronics had emerged as an area for scientific study in the 1930s, but its promise as a powerful and commercially viable ingredient in data recording and transmission was only just starting to be realized. was now incorporating electronics into several of its new tools, enabling the company to provide smaller, more robust equipment. 
Development efforts were now focused on two types of sophisticated electronic sondes, or probes. The first type was capable of taking high-resolution measurements close to the borehole wall and in very thin beds—tools such as the Microlog and the Microlaterolog. The Microlog, introduced in 1948, was a high-resolution array of three electrodes and an insulating pad that could detect permeable zones across which mudcake had formed when it was applied to a borehole wall. The Microlaterolog investigated deeper and delivered data on the resistivity of the flushed zone—the rock around the borehole flushed with drilling fluids.   
The second type, the induction log, took measurements farther from the borehole in areas of the formation unaffected by the presence of the well, making it suitable for wells drilled with oil-base fluids. The first induction log was recorded in Texas in 1946. The first commercial induction tool was introduced in the Gulf of Mexico in 1952 and the first induction-electrical log was brought onto the market four years after that. In 1959, introduced what became the industry-standard induction array. These new tools provided accurate data that could be computer processed to give a quantitative interpretation of the potential oil production of the reservoir rock.
In 1951, began to experiment with a microneutron device, which could measure formation porosity by sensing the amount of hydrogen present. Work also got under way on another technique for quantifying formation porosity, based on attenuation of gamma rays.
Sonic measurements, introduced in 1952, provided better depth control for perforations and for placing well-completion equipment; their use quickly spread into other areas, such as rock property evaluation, porosity and fracture analysis, cement evaluation and the correlation of well logs and seismic data.  
The later incorporated in Accelerator Porosity Tool (APT) had its origins around this time, with work that began in 1955 on "slowing down time," a technique to measure formation hydrogen concentration by detecting energy reduction of source neutrons. The precursors to today’s modular fluid sampling and pressure testing tools also emerged, when, in 1956, Henri Doll patented methods of determining hydraulic characteristics of formations traversed by a borehole.
also strengthened its operations through restructuring and strategic acquisitions. Limited was created as a holding company registered in Curaçao in 1956. Henri Doll was appointed as its first Chairman of the Board of Limited, and, three years after Marcel died, his son Pierre became President.
The company bought 50% of the Forex drilling rig company in 1952 and, four years later, it acquired Johnson Testers, the first of many acquisitions enabling to supply a more complete spectrum of formation evaluation measurements. 
Alert to the potential stresses placed on the company’s knowledge base by its rapid expansion, in 1956 instigated the practice of assigning senior technical staff to support young field engineers—a move that has served the company well ever since. Roger Jost, one of the trio that ran the first log at Pechelbronn in 1927, was assigned to the Paris office where he answered questions and tested equipment before it was deployed. Today, all engineers benefit from a centralized system connecting them to people and information, so lessons learned in one place are learned by all.

2010—Today: The Integration of 1940s: New Frontiers
World War inevitably slowed the rapid spread of logging technology, but nonetheless continued to make significant advances during the 1940s
In 1940, the company moved its headquarters to Houston to take advantage of the USA’s position as a global leader, especially in electronics. However, Marcel remained based in France, where he and his team continued to invent and innovate.
Logging trucks were modernized, equipped with a winch and an electrical cable capable of operating a wide range of services in ever-deeper boreholes. New devices, designed to complement electrical logging tools, provided measurements of borehole parameters such as diameter, temperature and inclination.
Significant contributions were being made to technological knowledge. In 1942, Gus Archie of Shell Oil published a report on the relationship between electrical resistivity and porosity and water saturation in oil-bearing rocks. "Archie's Law" was to become the foundation of petrophysical-log interpretation.
As the decade progressed, logging applications began to expand beyond formation evaluation. In 1946, the casing collar locator was first deployed to measure changes in magnetic flux at the collar’s location. This breakthrough made it much easier to correlate openhole and cased hole logs taken from the same wellbore.
The following year, the first induction log was recorded in a Humble Oil well in Tyler, Texas, helping to distinguish oil- from water-bearing rock layers when the borehole contains fluid that does not conduct electricity. 
The late 1940s was also the period when the first offshore oil rigs were being deployed in the Gulf of Mexico, opening up new possibilities for technology. 
Meanwhile, the nature of the oilfield services sector was changing. Henri Doll said increasing competition between companies provided with an extra incentive to advance and grow—and, having rebuffed a takeover attempt by Halliburton, that is what the company did.
“Where the drill goes, goes” became a rallying cry. As the company expanded globally, it took on increasing numbers of local recruits, providing the cultural diversity that still defines Schlumberger’s character today. 
Keeping ahead of competitors required substantial investment in cutting-edge research. In 1948, Doll was charged with establishing a new research center in Ridgefield, Connecticut - the Schlumberger-Doll Research Center. This provided the springboard for the technological breakthroughs that would define success in the second half of the 20th century. The Center, which still plays a significant role in the company’s R&activities, is now located in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

It took until 1920 for Conrad to publish the results of the experimental surface resistivity measurements he had carried out since 1911.
In the same year, Conrad and Marcel opened their first office at 30 rue Fabert in Paris.
Conrad’s focus on making geophysical measurements became all-consuming now, prompting him to resign his professorship at École de Mines, Paris in 1923.
Conrad and Marcel spent the next three years conducting geophysical surveys in Serbia, Canada, South Africa, Congo and the USA, as well as Romania, where they made the first mapping of an oil-productive salt dome using electrical prospecting.
In 1926, they created the Société de Prospection Électrique, or “Pros” as it was nicknamed—the forerunner of the company. Initially, the firm carried out surface prospecting for the metal ore mining industry but gradually extended its activities to embrace exploration of possible oil-bearing structures.
To better understand measurements made at the surface, the brothers needed to incorporate resistivity information from deeper formations. Conrad had the idea of measuring resistivity directly with an electrical probe, or sonde, run into boreholes drilled through the formations.
The first attempt to do this was made on September 5, 1927 by a team led by experimental physicist Henri Doll, Conrad’s son-in-law. Measurements were taken from an electrical sonde at various discrete depths in a 500-meter-deep well in Pechelbronn in the Alsace region of France. new term was coined to describe the results of this multi-depth survey: it was called an electrical resistivity well log.
This first log was little more than a simple hand-plotted graph, but it marked a turning point in the history of oil exploration. Before then, engineers and scientists had to rely on core samples or cuttings brought up from boreholes to assess the composition of subsurface rocks. But the indications these gave were highly unreliable and frequently missed oil zones. The log showed that electrical measurements taken in boreholes could help identify the geological formations around them. It effectively enabled people to “see” what was down the well—and because the resistivity recordings proved to be repeatable in neighboring wells, it was possible to enable precise correlation of formations across an entire field. 
International demand for the process, also known as “electrical coring,” grew rapidly. By 1929, sub-surface logs were being run in Argentina, Ecuador, India, Japan, the Soviet Union, Venezuela and the 
More patents were filed around the world, ensuring that the intellectual property of products was secured early.

2010—Today: The Integration of 1930s: in Demand
Logging techniques took a leap forward with the introduction of the continuous-recording hand recorder, which enabled a continuous log of formation resistivity to be plotted while the sonde was withdrawn steadily from the hole. This was a big improvement on the pre-existing point-by-point system and enabled an engineer to log 1,000 feet in an hour under good conditions.
This was followed by another breakthrough, with the introduction in 1931, of the Spontaneous Potential (SP) log. Measuring the produced naturally by the borehole mud at the boundaries of permeable beds provided a way to distinguish permeable rock capable of holding a reservoir from impermeable rock, through which it was difficult for fluids to flow.
In February 1932, Conrad and Marcel presented the first comprehensive description of the principles of well logging to the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers in New York. Their paper was called "Electrical Coring: Method of Determining Bottom-Hole Data by Electrical Measurements."
By the mid-1930s, electrical coring, or electric logging, had truly arrived. Pros teams went to the main oil-producing countries of the day—Romania, Venezuela, Trinidad, Dutch East Indies and the The number of teams grew from 8 in 1933 to more than 140 just before World War II.
Pros, meanwhile, was growing into three international companies that ultimately became the global organization of today. The founding in 1935 of the Well Surveying (now Well Services) in Houston, Texas reflected the growing importance of the market, with more than half of the Pros teams now working in the US.
Conrad died in May 1936, in Stockholm, while returning from a business trip to the Soviet Union. He lived long enough to see the establishment of the global foundations of the company that bears his name.

The company has made further strides in understanding reservoirs and launched a host of new technologies and products. Integration of its tools has been crucial to the improvement of services. Imaging tools, production logging tools and Scanner 3tools were integrated with other technologies to achieve superior reservoir characterization from initial acquisition through to reservoir simulation.
The launch of the Analysis Behind Casing suite of services in 2002 provided a valuable new aid in the evaluation of cased wells where openhole logging is too risky, or in old wells where reevaluation can reveal bypassed pay zones. The suite includes technologies to measure porosity, resistivity, lithology, shale content, fluid saturations, and pressure, as well as enabling the recovery of fluid samples.
The commercialization of the Scanner family of downhole rock and fluid characterization services in 2005 provided engineers with access to new-generation nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) tools, as well as sonic, resistivity, pulse-echo impedance, and three phase production logging measurements, reducing uncertainty in reservoir and fluid characterization.
Quicksilver Probe wireline sampling technology, introduced in 2006, provided a way to deliver fluid samples quickly with little or no contamination. This was complemented in 2007 by the arrival of the InSitu Density sensor, the first of the InSitu family of fluid properties measurement tools.
also reinforced its seismic offering. Geco-Prakla was combined with Western Geophysical in 2000 to create WesternGeco, 70%-owned by and 30% by Baker Hughes.  Six years later bought Baker Hughes’ stake to take full ownership.
series of acquisitions in the seismic sector over the rest of the decade has built on this platform. Petrel Workflow Tools was acquired in 2002, bringing with it Petrel seismic interpretation software, which increases reservoir performance by helping geophysicists, geologists, and reservoir engineers to develop collaborative workflows and integrate operations to streamline processes.
WesternGeco began its Q-Marine surveys in 2000. WesternGeco and Statoil created the industry's first long-term reservoir monitoring program in 2004. Late in the same year, Petrobras awarded WesternGeco what was then the world's largest-ever 4seismic project, shooting over the Marlin field offshore Brazil.
Additions were made to the company’s global “teleport” network of satellite communications bases with the opening of new facilities in Brazil and Singapore and a second teleport in Aberdeen, Scotland. now has 12 teleports around the world, supporting its full range of (Very Small Aperture Terminal) communications services.

An unrivalled and undiminished commitment to research and development means is able to provide customers with the technology, analytical tools and expertise tailored to meet today’s technical challenges.
The company’s products and services enable improved efficiency, together with enhanced information flow and analysis. That means better reservoir characterization, more accurate and effective drilling.
Innovative products introduced in recent years are already making a big difference to our clients. The Dielectric Scanner service, launched in 2010, was the first in the industry to accurately quantify residual hydrocarbon volume, Archie’s exponents and formation cation exchange capacity (CEC), so reducing uncertainties and eliminating the wait for laboratory analysis.
digital slickline services, introduced in 2011, allow two-way digital communication using a slickline cable enabling tool and well information to be transmitted to the surface in real time. This advance enables oil and gas producers to manage well intervention and workover programs with increased knowledge, accuracy and certainty, reducing manpower requirements, saving time and cutting operational risk.
Schlumberger’s range also includes products designed for the expanding shale oil and gas sector, such as the Openfamily of fluid systems for hydraulic fracturing, the HiChannel Fracturing service, M-SWACO’s water-base drilling fluid and Smith Bits’ Spear shale-optimized steel body polycrystalline diamond compact bit./
Strategic mergers and acquisitions remain central to the company’s drive to offer a comprehensive package of products and services to customers. The merger with Smith International in 2010 widened Schlumberger's lead as the world's largest oilfield services company in terms of revenue and market capitalization. Smith and M-technologies and expertise complement Schlumberger’s offerings, while benefitting from Schlumberger’s large geographical footprint.
The acquisition of Geoservices, also in 2010, expanded Schlumberger’s products and services in mud logging, slickline and production surveillance operations.
continues to build on its reputation for outstanding research through the geographical expansion of its R&network. The 2010 opening of the new Brazil Research and Geoengineering Center in Rio de Janeiro and the opening, in 2011, of WesternGeco’s Penang Product Center in Malaysia reflect our desire to establish R&facilities close to new hydrocarbons development areas, enabling the company to tap into new talent and tailor new products to specialized local conditions.

The Foundation is a non-profit organization overseen by a Board of Directors and managed and administered by employees. It operates under two legal entities, the Foundation Inc., registered in 1954 in the United States and the Stichting Fund registered in 1985 in the Netherlands. 
The first reference to a Foundation created in the United States was in the 1954 Annual Report as follows: “
Through the years we have relied heavily on our universities as the source of the technical personnel to whom so much of our progress is due. As an acknowledgement of the essential role that these universities have played in our past growth and will play in our future, your Board of Directors has created the Foundation for the purpose of establishing scholarships and fellowships for scientific studies.”
Since its inception the Foundation has focused on funding a variety of programs in scientific education all over the world:
University Endowments were established over a 23 year period starting in 1976 to finance Chairs at Rice and in the United States and Cambridge in the United Kingdom, to name just a few. 
In 2003 the Foundation became a sponsoring partner with “Africa Array” established to create new geo-scientific research and training programs and rebuild existing ones in Africa with Africans for Africans. 
In 2005 “Lab in a Lorry” got under way as a joint initiative with the Institute of Physics bringing the opportunity to young people to explore science through hands-on experiments and attracting over 1,000 volunteers from the scientific world to share their knowledge. 
From 2005-2007 the Foundation had a partnership with United World Colleges (UWC) to fund students from disadvantaged backgrounds with an interest and talent in science to study at colleges. total of 21 students graduated from this program.  
In 2004, the Faculty for the Future program was launched to provide funding to women from emerging economies for advanced graduate study in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) in the best faculties for their discipline overseas. It is currently the sole program funded by the Foundation. The long term goal of the program is to address the gender gap in disciplines by selecting the most talented female scientists, providing them with a unique opportunity to develop their skills, exposing them to vital international experience and networking, thereby training them to become future leaders, change agents and policy makers back in their home regions where they are ultimately expected to return. The Faculty for the Future program is growing each year and has become a powerful community that today stands at 405 pioneering women scientists from 68 countries.

One of our greatest strengths is the diversity of our workforce, with men and women of many nationalities and backgrounds working together and sharing common objectives. does not have a 'nationality' which describes its culture, but operates in a truly global fashion throughout the world. As a company, we encourage fair employment practices worldwide and offer equal opportunities to all our employees. We also try to take family considerations into account in any decisions about personnel matters or assignments.
Workplace Diversity—developing human resources for the future
Our customers, suppliers and shareholders are increasingly global and diverse. They expect us to understand, respond and deliver services that meet their unique expectations. 
We must attract and retain top performers worldwide from the full depth of the talent pool and address the evolving needs of our workforce in terms of quality of life and dual career expectations. By creating a variety of perspectives—gender and culture—that stimulate productive creativity and innovation—we maintain our competitive edge.  
Three prerequisites upon which we will proceed with our diversity efforts: 
We are a publicly traded concerned with profitability and shareholder return. 
Meritocracy drives our actions, decisions and employee advancement. 
While it is a competitive advantage that our workforce communicates in a multitude of languages, English is the common language of our internal management communication. 
Gender Diversity—a commitment to act
Our gender diversity focus began in 1994 and we have made progress since that time. Looking forward, our goal is to continually increase the percentage of women we recruit worldwide, ensure proper career development for high-performing women, and increase our organizational flexibility to accommodate a wider range of personal situations. 
Nationality Diversity—leveraging the human resources of all nations
has been successful in attracting and developing nonwestern nationalities or nationalities from emerging countries, now integrated into all levels of the work force, including senior management. 
Family and Work Life-mobility initiatives that work
Our people, men and women worldwide, are our main asset. The change in the composition of our workforce necessitates an adjustment in our attitude toward recruitment, retention and mobility of our employees.
One of the most significant changes in our society in the last several decades has been the entry and continued presence of women in the working population. Families in marriages in which both spouses work are now the largest single group of families in the workplace. 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 60% of all marriages are dual-career marriages; these couples make up 45% of the workforce. 
Because the proportion of people in dual career relationships is on the increase, this creates new challenges for the organization.
2017 Gender Pay Gap Report
The Government recently enacted The Equality Act 2010 (Gender Pay Gap Information) Regulations 2017, requiring companies with more than 250 employees to publish figures related to gender pay. This report provides a consolidated snapshot of the gender pay gap for in the UK, excluding Northern Ireland, and the gender pay gap for each of our five entities with more than 250 employees as of April 5, 2017.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) adopted final rules in August 2012 regarding disclosure and reporting requirements with respect to the use of “conflict minerals” to implement Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The rules require public companies such as to perform supply chain due diligence and disclose annually whether certain products they manufacture or contract to manufacture contain conflict minerals originating from the “covered countries” that are necessary to the functionality or production of those products.  
Definitions. The term “
” means the Democratic Republic of the Congo (the “
”) and its adjoining countries. “
” means tin (cassiterite), tungsten (wolframite), tantalum (columbite-tantalite or coltan), gold or their derivatives, which originate in the covered countries.  
recognizes that there are serious human rights abuses associated with the extraction, transportation and trade in minerals in the covered countries. We have always supported responsible sourcing of materials from suppliers that share our values and we commit to avoid contributing to the conflict through our sourcing activity.
As expressed in our code of conduct (our “Blue Print in Action”), does not tolerate any corruption of any kind in dealings with its suppliers, and we expect our suppliers to adhere to the same standard. We work with our suppliers in a socially responsible and ethical manner. potential supplier is selected and retained only after it has evidenced in writing its adherence to our code of conduct and other internal compliance requirements, including health and safety, and environmental. In addition, we audit our top suppliers every two years to ensure adherence to our code of conduct. Below is our position statement regarding conflict minerals to supplement our Code of Conduct. 
Position Statement – Conflict Minerals
is committed to purchase only those parts and products containing minerals that have been procured through a validated conflict-free supply chain, so as to avoid the use of minerals that have financed conflict in the covered countries, and we expect our suppliers to abide by the same standard.  
is taking a variety of actions designed to assist in compliance with the conflict minerals rules. For example:
we have identified, and will continue to identify, conflict minerals necessary for the production or the functionality of covered products that we sell; 
we have performed, and intend to continue to perform, supply chain due diligence in general accordance with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development’s internationally recognized and established due diligence framework; 
we expect our direct suppliers to perform similar due diligence on the sources of conflict minerals in their supply chains, and expect them to require their own suppliers to do the same; 
once a robust and validated conflict-free supply chain is established or a robust mineral tracing program is developed, we will expect our direct suppliers to procure only minerals using that validated supply chain, so as to avoid the use of minerals that have financed conflict in the covered countries; and 
in the event that a direct supplier is found to supply us with necessary conflict minerals that have not been procured through a validated supply chain or that are otherwise found to have financed conflict, we will take action such as recommending that such supplier seek alternative means of sourcing, or failing that, we will reassess the supplier relationship. 
We will periodically review our conflict minerals position statement to ensure ongoing suitability in addition to our suppliers’ basic obligations to comply with standards.

Solids Treatment & Disposal
Managing solids throughout your gas and liquid process
The presence of solids in production fluids can be detrimental throughout the process train, causing erosion-related equipment damage, system fouling and plugging, and inefficient equipment performance. Our solids management technologies enable separation, transportation, and treatment of solids prior to disposal.
Combining these technologies with our expertise in reservoir characterization and well testing enables us to help you optimize facility design and flow assurance planning. Knowing when you will have solids in your production fluids and the nature of these solids is a significant advantage in designing a separation and handling system and mitigating production downtime.   
Hydrocyclonic Solids-Water Separation
Increased solids removal while allowing full production and reducing downstream issues through the treatment of produced water, aquifer water, and deballast water; hydrocarbon desanding; and other sand cleaning operations.
Wellhead Solids Removal
Unmatched performance and durability in one of the most aggressive solids management applications—sand removal from wellhead fluids for the protection of downstream equipment.
Settled Solids Management
Compact and efficient device used to generate flowing slurry from solids settled at the bottom of a tank or vessel.
Wellhead & Production Desanding
new generation of solids separation that is specifically aimed at multiphase wellstreams.
Solids Treatment & Disposal
Technologies that integrate with sophisticated process design methodologies to provide you with the tools to optimize sand management for every application, including multiphase, in separator, and liquid phase.

Acid Gas Membrane Performance
Improve performance of membrane through predictive monitoring and analysis
Acid gas membrane performance is the 
software as a service
 digital solution that monitors your facility operations data  to predict the performance and remaining useful life of acid gas removal membranes and autonomously identify events.
Although acid gas membranes are widely used onshore and offshore for CO
 removal from natural gas, the performance of these efficient, compact systems is highly dependent on field operations practices and the condition of the natural gas feed stream. 
If operating conditions are not known and controlled, the system can easily be damaged. The resulting weakened performance can lead to undesirable product gas specifications, contractual penalties, unexpected downtime, and ultimately the risk of environmental impact. 
Improve the Performance of Acid Gas Membranes
Find out how Process services can improve your membrane performance — complete the form and an expert will contact you. 
Anticipate performance upset to automatically optimize membrane life
Until the introduction of Process services for acid gas membrane performance, there has not been an intelligent, automated system for accurately gauging CO
 membrane health and performance. This complete prediction solution ends the current maintenance uncertainty and overspend on premature or reactive membrane replacement.
Process services for gas membrane systems enable operators to anticipate performance upset by applying predictive monitoring and active machine learning using continuous monitoring of facility operations. The proprietary performance modeling integrates manufacturer expertise with empirical data analytics from an extensive database of operating facilities.
In addition to accurately anticipating performance upset, acid gas membrane performance identifies critical events. Operators are able to proactively manage remaining membrane performance to both extend membrane lifetime and optimize membrane module replacement expenditure.
