In the chaotic period immediately following WWII, radio was about the only form of entertainment and information source available.
Super heterodyne radio with far superior performance compared with the conventional super-regeneration system rapidly became popular.
Murata’s tubular ceramic capacitor was used for temperature compensation in those radios. Its dielectric material was titanium oxide. The electrode material was brushed on the surface. Its capacitance was 500 pF.
In 1952, the head office and plant were moved to Yamashina, Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto City.
In 1955, Murata’s research division became Omiya Technology Research Laboratory Company. (Later, it was moved to Nagaokakyo City as Technology Research Laboratory Co.)
food shortage after the prompted increased exploitation of marine resources. Thus, Japan became a fishery capital of the world. Fish finders played a large role in this trend.
The piezoelectric resonator for the fish finder had the Langevin structure, where a piezoelectric disc type resonator made with barium titanate was sandwiched between two thick steel plates. It provided good response underwater up to a depth of 90 m.
The first transistor radios hit the market in 1955. The basic trend of seeking downsizing and portability for household electronic equipment was set by this event.
commercialized radio ceramic filters, using lead zirconium titanate, an excellent piezoelectric material. It took 10 more years for this product to penetrate the market, however.
Color TVs appeared in the market right before the largest post-war event, the Tokyo Olympics.
thermistor was used in the degaussing circuits of color TVs. When the switch is turned on, a strong surge of electric current activates degaussing, directly followed by self-generation of heat, limiting the current flow.
Ceramic filters were also improved by having higher frequency and integration, and became a hit.
In 1973, Co., Inc. was established in Georgia, U.S.A.
It used to be a status symbol to make a phone call from a car. However, the initial car phone systems were incredibly large.
When it was first developed, the main component of the system, the cavity resonance filter, filled up the trunk of a car. Introduction of GIGAFIL® enabled considerable size reduction contributing to the future development of today`s mobile phones.
The Yasu Plant in Yasu-cho, Yasu-gun, Shiga in 1987 and the Yokohama R&Center in 1988 were established to fortify Murata’s R&capability.

Contribute to development of a future to be achieved by electronics, continuing to be a company needed by customers and society in any era
Changes in the society surrounding us
Digitization of every type of “object” and Murata’s expanding business opportunities
The appearance of electronics symbolizing the times – radios, color televisions, cameras, computers, mobile phones, and smartphones – has improved people’s quality of life. The history of has been with rooted in such progress in society. By supporting achievement of product functions to be required in each age, has contributed to society and continued to be needed by society. Now, in this age, every type of “object” in our surroundings is being digitized and is required to create new value by making use of its innovation.
Regarding smartphones which have driven the recent electronic parts market and rapid growth of Murata, volume growth has been moderate, but the number of functions increases, the number of electronic parts used per unit has drastically increased. Also, thanks to
increasing speed and functions of communication due to movements such as the introduction of 5G, this is an area where growth is expected as a pillar of our business in the future.
The automobile industry is also seeing changes which must not overlook. In Europe, China, India and other countries, entire nations are moving to shift theindustry from gasoline and diesel vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs). Due to an accelerated shift to EVs, some estimates suggest that in 2040, EVs will account for more than 50% of global new car sales. Furthermore, in parallel with the shift to EVs, development of autonomous vehicles is accelerating. Automation to maintain lanes and distance between cars on expressways as well as to follow the vehicle ahead during congestion has started to come into wide use as a part of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). Consequently, the number of sensors to be used for safe travel is increasing. In addition, high-speed wireless communication (V2X) associated with an increase of data traffic between cars and the outside world will be a requirement, alongside computer processing systems for large amounts of data inside a car in real-time. In terms of demand for parts over the medium term, it is said that with shifts to EVs and autonomous cars, the number of electronic parts used per vehicle will significantly increase compared to vehicles with internal-combustion engines.
In addition to further digitization of smartphones and cars, development of an Iosociety is a trend to be noted. Against a background of an expanding Iosociety where every type of object is connected via networks, an increasing number of devices will be connected to
networks. Moreover, considering the expanding demand for base stations and servers which process and store data collected from those devices and high-speed computers which are used for new value creation using AI, demand for electronic parts used for these items will also grow by an order of magnitude faster than before, creating new demand for a significant amount of electronic parts.
Networks, technology development capacity, monozukuri capabilities, and organizational cooperation to integrate these elements
believe that has three strong points which enable us to steadily seize these expanding business opportunities and sustain growth.
The first is “‘a global network and deep customer base through which we can speedily understand customer needs.” Since its foundation, Murata’s mainstay business has been capacitors and other general-purpose electronic parts. large number of these general-purpose electronic parts are used for various kinds of electronic devices and contacts customers in various fields all around the world. Therefore, we can quickly see the latest market information and needs. has satisfied various customer needs worldwide and established a structure under which products and services are supplied stably. Currently, sales in overseas markets account for more than 90% of total sales and a large variety of products have captured the largest or second largest share in the global market. Furthermore, Murata’s global network mostly consists of networks at our group organizations, enabling strong cooperation. Thus, we are able to communicate with many customers in various industries and quickly understand their demands and emerging needs.
The second is “‘technology development capacity’ which realizes customer needs.” As trends in electronics markets change, to satisfy customer needs which are increasingly diversified with the times, has expanded the boundaries of value that we can offer,from smaller, higher performance single-function components to more highly functional device components, and further to modules incorporating those components and solutions. To create unique and highly competitive products, we are conducting technology development ahead of competitors and internally developing materials, processes, products and production technology for many products. These are vertically integrated for realizing rapid product commercialization.
The third is “‘monozukuri (manufacturing) capabilities’ ensuring mass production and timely delivery to customers.” At Murata, each plant has independently and uniquely improved its processes over many years to enhance productivity and cost competitiveness. Through these accumulated technologies and expertise, reliable production can be realized on a large scale. Particularly, the production volume of multilayer ceramic capacitors, one of the core products of Murata, exceeds one trillion per year despite its highly complex production process, placing them on the largest scale in the industry.
And then, the three strong points described above of networks, technology development capacity, and monozukuri capabilities are integrated through Murata’s organizational cooperation. At Murata, each function of the value chain closely works together and by integrating individual strong points into that of the entire organization, is making efforts to provide better value to customers.
Penetration of the “Philosophy” and innovation driven by CS/ES
As stated above, has continued to demonstrate its unique strengths since its foundation, because the ideals and values shared by all employees work as driving
Sharing of the “Philosophy” as prescribed by our founder is placed in the most important position. regards the “Philosophy” as a philosophy which serves as a major guideline for its business activities. As the scale of business expands and employees are diversified, to demonstrate collective strength through cooperation among employees with a sense of unity, it is important that all employees understand the “Philosophy” well as a common ideal. For example, innovation described in Philosophy indicates that development of a pioneering spirit is important for any job in addition to avoidance of price competition through unique products with higher added value. Also, regarding contribution to the advancement of society, it links to continued awareness of the social significance of our company’s existence.
The recent focus on “CS” and “ES” that set out as important values is also a concept derived from a passage of Philosophy – thankful for the increase in prosperity – in addition to the above.
We define “CS” as continuing “to create and provide value that customers appreciate” and “ES” as ensuring “each and every employee feels rewarded and continues to grow through his or her work.”
creates a virtuous cycle in its business activities by placing importance on the values of and to create new innovation. This virtuous cycle is a driving force for reinforcing Murata’s strengths even further.
Contribute to development of a new future as an “Innovator in Electronics”
In addition to contribution to society through products and services, has established a Charter with the Philosophy as a benchmark and a Management Committee to fulfill various types of social responsibility. For ongoing contribution to realization of a sustainable society, needs to be a sustainable company. To this end, we need to face various social problems such as climate change and other environmental problems, as well as issues in human rights that should not be violated.
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are global issues to be achieved by 2030 are also great social issues that should face. We believe that Murata’s mission is to contribute to solving these issues and create new value for society through business activities.
We at aim to contribute to realization of true quality of life for people. For this purpose, we express what we should be through the words of “Innovator in Electronics,” and enthusiastically commit ourselves to lead innovation in the electronics industry and take autonomous action for the environment and society.
Currently, Murata’s network has expanded globally. Creation of innovation through connection of each and every employee in the world is important for to provide the value which customers worldwide appreciate and continue to make our future richer and better. We will write the story of Murata, which continues to contribute to a new future, placing importance on ideas embodied in Philosophy.

Prohibit bribery and unfair acts or practices.
We request that our suppliers follow sound and fair business practices to enable continual business transactions and build collaborative trusting relationships. We also ask our suppliers to disclose to appropriate information on their management policies and business conditions, including financial situations.
3.Quality, delivery performance, and stable supply
stresses quality and delivery performance in order to provide customers with better quality products in a timely manner. Accordingly, we expect our suppliers to meet quality and delivery commitments and to provide a stable supply of materials.
emphasizes green procurement in order to provide customers with products that have less of an environmental impact. We therefore seek to deal with suppliers who have established management systems and can provide materials with a smaller environmental footprint.
Technical innovation is very fast paced and product life cycles are extremely short in the electronic device industry, which is also challenged by severe price competition. These pressures continuously require us to develop new products and offer them at reasonable prices. As such, we strive to deal with suppliers who can provide new materials and cost improvements through Value Engineering.
With technical innovation in the electronic device industry constantly in high gear, dealing with these innovations is a constant challenge. Moreover, regulations related to protection of the global environment and environmental requests from customers are increasing year by year. Because of this, we must constantly obtain information on new technologies and new products (materials). We therefore seek to deal with suppliers who can provide such information.
As indicated above, technical innovation is very fast paced and product life cycles are extremely short in the electronic device industry. This is just as true at Murata, where reducing the lead-time for material procurement is one of our most important issues, in order to ensure customer satisfaction by responding promptly and flexibly to client requests. This is why we expect our suppliers to shorten material procurement lead-times to rapidly and flexibly deal with market changes.
We try as much as possible to provide our suppliers with information that is needed to complete transactions. Some of the information provided includes Murata’s trade secrets. Accordingly, we seek to deal with suppliers who can and will keep the information provided confidential.
We believe that exchanging information with our suppliers through information technology and networks is vital for accelerating our business operations and strengthening our relationships with suppliers. Therefore, we seek to deal with suppliers who can prepare and utilize an information technology environment.
We do not conduct business with companies that have ties to organized crime groups, commonly known as “anti-social forces” in Japan.
We therefore demand that our suppliers do not do business with companies associated with organized crime.
