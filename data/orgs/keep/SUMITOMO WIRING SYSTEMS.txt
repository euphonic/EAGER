September18, 2018 Systems, Ltd.
Systems, Ltd. (SWS) (Head office: Yokkaichi City, Mie Prefecture, President: Fumiyoshi Kawai) celebrated our 100th anniversary of business in December 2017, and we published the "Centennial History of SWS" on this occasion. The outline of which is as below.
Electrical supply was widespread in Yokkaichi City, Mie Prefecture in the middle of the Taisho era (1912 to 1926).  Forecasting an increasing demand for electric wires, our founder established Tokai Electric Wire Co., Ltd. in December 1917.  Although we started out manufacturing electric wires to transmit and distribute electricity to lamps, we began to manufacture harnesses for automobiles in 1959, which has continued to date.  The company has grown remarkably, spurred by the development of motorization.  As we celebrated the 100th anniversary of our business, we published the "Centennial History of SWS" as one of several projects that contribute to the sustainable growth of the company's business toward the next century.
This publication is composed of two parts: Part 1 "From Electric Wires to Harnesses" covers approximately 70 years since the foundation of the company, and Part 2 "Establishment of Global Corporate Image" covers the remaining 30 years.
The B5 size (182 mm x 257 mm) publication has 546 pages and 1,400 copies have been printed.  It was released today, September 18, 2018, and will be distributed to our business partners.
