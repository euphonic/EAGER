In our Communities
Community Involvement
Community Involvement
Around the world, in more than 100 sales, manufacturing and regional offices, and its employees are committed to being a positive presence in the communities in which we work and live.
Charitable, civic and professional organizations that approach us for assistance find a shared commitment to community involvement held at every level of our organization. The majority of our corporate officers serve on non-profit boards, while scores of other associates also volunteer their time to serve organizations in our communities around the globe.
supports charities and community groups worldwide that are committed to making quality of life improvements for their communities, fostering sustainability, innovation and environmental stewardship. Of particular note, associates have rallied around fundraising and support for the United Way, with the majority of our North American associates donating to the organization. Including company contributions and other fundraising activities, has raised more than $6 million for United Way and affiliated agencies since 2006. From blood drives to food drives, and from elementary classrooms to high school mentorship programs, associates pitch in to help make where we live a better place.
As began our transformation into a specialty company, we also embarked on another important transformation – that of becoming a leader in our communities through our continuous and extensive cooperation with United Way. Driven by the generosity and dedication of our North American associates, has since significantly grown our participation and contributions to the United Way. We’ve done so by hosting local fundraising and awareness campaigns at roughly 60 locations in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. As a result we’ve donated more than $6 million since 2006, and our campaign now consistently raises more than $1 million each year. These funds are allocated locally where we have facilities – to countless non-profit service organizations making a difference in the lives of our neighbors. At we work hard to “Live United” through volunteering of our time and talents, as well as the generous financial contributions of our associates, company and suppliers.
The Community Service Team at shares one unified goal: to lead associates in actively contributing to the communities in which we operate. By pursuing volunteer opportunities that inspire and support the people around us, we simultaneously foster an internal culture of service, compassion and collaboration. The
Community Service team has worked with the following organizations to make a positive difference in the world:

PolyOne’s Board of Directors has a long-standing Environment, Health and Safety (EH&S) Committee. The charter of the Committee is to oversee and monitor the establishment and maintenance by management of comprehensive environmental, health, safety, security and product stewardship policies, standards and practices to procure regulatory compliance and safety/environmental operational excellence on a global basis.
EH&Management, Reporting & Auditing
key part of our management systems are internal audit and review programs, which periodically examine plant operations and develop recommendations to enhance performance. The scope of this audit/review process includes compliance to policies and standards as well as applicable regulations. These standards include:
Environmental, Health and Safety Capital Appropriation Review
Recycle/Reuse and Waste Management Procedures
Groundwater Protection Program
New Chemical Review
Crisis Management Emergency Response Planning
Product Regulatory Compliance Review
strives to achieve high environmental standards in both mature and emerging markets through the development of security and environmental management systems, audit/review procedures, certifications, local training programs and best-practice management systems.
Our EH&Security Management System includes forward-planning process which reviews potential environmental and community impact of our manufacturing operations and identifies opportunities to improve the performance of our operations and comply with current and anticipated regulations.
Our Environmental Management System establishes internal performance and audit/review standards for all our facilities comparable to 14001 standards. Certain facilities have also received official certification to the 14001 International Environmental Management System. 14001 certifications follow intensive environmental audits of organizations, conducted by third-party representatives. At present, multiple facilities hold 14001 Certification.
In order to continuously track progress made toward achieving environmental, health and safety (EH&S) goals, has implemented a reporting program which includes:
Monthly reporting of production rates, waste generation rates, recycling rates, disposal methods, and compliance.
Quarterly reporting of progress made toward completion of internal environmental audit/review action items.
Annual reporting of energy use, water use, environmental capital needs for the coming five years, potential impacts of pending regulations, and narrative status reports on management systems related to air, land and water pollution prevention and control.
Monthly, quarterly and yearly reporting of safety and health statistics and benchmarking against other best-in-class companies.

Toys, Phthalates and Lead 
Meeting the Challenge of the Consumer Products Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA)
What is the Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA)?
The Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act (CPSIA), which went into effect February 10, 2009, is a sweeping new law that impacts a broad spectrum of our economy. From manufacturers of toys to the kids that play with them, everyone is affected in some way—even those who make and donate products to hospitals and charities. There are new rules to be understood and adopted for everyone from the largest global manufacturer to the crafter working in the family workshop to the mom-and-pop shop on the corner. Indeed, all children’s products including toys, books, childcare articles and clothing are covered in different ways by this law, and there are different rules for different products.
What is the first step should take in addressing this issue?
Do your research first to become as knowledgeable as possible. Check with your suppliers to determine how they are addressing requirements in their products. Find out what the government requires manufacturers to provide in terms of certification and testing. There are several useful web sites you can reference. These include:
The Consumer Products Safety Commission (CPSC)
The Toy Industry Association Inc.
Polymer Diagnostics Incorporated
How can be certain the raw materials buy are compliant?
The timetable for testing, certification and enforcement as outlined on the web site (see link in adjacent column), generally requires compliance in advance of testing and certification. You should study this timetable carefully and ask your suppliers how and when they are planning to provide certification for the raw materials you purchase to ensure you can meet the timetable.
How can find the right polymer or additive for my needs? 
has a broad portfolio of sustainable solutions including CPSIA-compliant and non-phthalate compounds and additives that meet the requirements of the Act, without sacrificing performance or processability. These and all materials carry our No Surprises Pledge
, which means that manufacturers can expect the materials produces contain only ingredients that conform to legal and regulatory compliance guidelines.
Where can find testing services for my products and those of my suppliers?
Polymer Diagnostics Inc. (PDI), a wholly owned subsidiary of Corp., can test raw materials, compounds and finished goods. Depending on the results, additional analyses can be done to verify findings and insure accuracy, which helps reduce the potential for false positive results. is accredited under 17025 by A2(the American Association for Laboratory Accreditation) to perform testing as an independent laboratory body. PDI’s scope of accreditation currently includes plasticizer determination, as well as testing for lead.

Information Systems Use Policy
Temporary Contract Workers/Independent Contractors
This Information Systems Use Policy is intended to establish acceptable and prohibited uses of Corporation’s information systems to protect and its information systems and infrastructure from illegal or harmful actions, knowing or unknowing, committed by users of those systems and the infrastructure. Prohibited use exposes to risks including virus attacks, compromise of network systems and services, tangible property and intellectual property loss, business conduct and productivity issues, and consequential legal liability.
information systems includes all computer equipment, software, copiers, printers, operating systems, storage media (including USB-devices, data disks/cards, and optical media), network accounts providing electronic mail, network systems, voice switches and Internet access, that are owned, leased, or used by or that are under its administrative control ("Systems"). The Systems are PolyOne’s property and are to be used for business purposes to serve the best interests of the Company. Each user must read and comply with this Policy. This Policy should be construed together with and augment, and does not supersede, any other relevant terms and conditions that may apply to your relationship with PolyOne. 
This Policy applies to any person using information systems equipment, including without limitation employees, contractors, consultants, temporary workers, and other workers at ("Users"). This Policy applies to all Systems and resources. resources include expenses incurred for the operation of information systems equipment at locations not owned by PolyOne, such as home office computers and laptop computers owned or leased by PolyOne. When any other computer or device not owned or leased by (“Personal Device”) is in connection with a network, you should observe this Policy during such network connection.
General Usage and Ownership
Data and information created by Users on the Systems is the property of PolyOne. To the extent that such data or information created constitutes an original work of authorship under applicable copyright laws, subject to any written agreement to the contrary, owns the copyright to such work of authorship to the extent permitted by applicable law.
recommends that any information that Users consider sensitive or personal should not be sent via messaging mechanisms such as unencrypted email, texting or instant messaging. These mechanisms are not a secure vehicle for communication. If you have sensitive information that you need to convey, contact the Service Desk to assist you in making a secure transmission.
For security and network maintenance and protection purposes and to monitor and ensure compliance with this Policy, authorized individuals within IT may monitor or audit Systems use, including Internet traffic and e-mail content at any time without prior notice to the User to the extent permitted by applicable law, regulation or government order. Such monitoring or auditing may include monitoring or auditing of personal e-mail accounts accessed through the Systems, even those that are password protected, to the extent reasonably necessary and permitted by applicable law, regulation or government order.
Using Systems for limited and occasional personal and non-business purposes is permissible, but under no circumstances should it negatively affect the Systems or interfere with the User’s ability to fulfill his/her responsibilities to PolyOne. Unless specifically provided by applicable law, regulation or government order, Users have no right or expectation of privacy in any electronic or voice communication or information sent, received or stored on PolyOne’s Systems.
Do not co-mingle information with personal or non-information on shared storage devices.
Security and Proprietary Information
Information on Systems should be classified and treated as either confidential or not confidential, as defined by corporate confidentiality guidelines. Examples of confidential information include, but are not limited to: company private information, corporate strategies, competitor sensitive information, trade secrets, specifications, customer lists, information claimed by a customer as confidential, classified information, non-public financial information, research data, legal advice, and any other non-public information which gives any kind of advantage over its competitors.
Users should take all necessary steps to prevent unauthorized access to confidential information.
All office PCs, laptops and workstations must be secured with a password-protected screensaver with the automatic activation feature set at 10 minutes or less, or by logging-off when the computer will be unattended.
Because information contained on portable computers is especially vulnerable, special care must be exercised. Protect laptops from theft, especially while traveling. Laptops should not be left in a car; Users should take them to the hotel room or other destination and use hotel safes or lockboxes if available to secure laptops when Users are not in their hotel rooms. If laptops must be left in a car, they should be locked in the trunk, not visible to passers by. Users traveling by air should confirm that they get their laptop back after passing through security. Sensitive and business critical files saved on a local hard drive should be backed up before traveling and non-essential files should be removed if practical.
All computers that are connected to the network must be protected with approved virus-scanning software with a current virus database. The use of any Personal Devices must be reviewed and approved by the Department.
All Users must use extreme caution when opening e-mail attachments received from unknown senders, which may contain malware (viruses, trojans, worms, spyders or other spyware). If you have any doubts, delete the message without reading it; if you believe that a suspect e-mail may be of legitimate business value, contact the department for assistance.
Do not connect peripherals (e.g. memory devices, phones, wireless cards, and devices), unless you are they do not contain malware. If you are not certain whether a peripheral contains malware, contact the Department.
Users should regularly back up their data to the appropriate file server on PolyOne’s network. Data stored on individuals’ computer hard drives is not automatically backed up to file servers on PolyOne’s network.

Except for legitimate business purposes, solicitation of e-mail or electronic communications for transmission to any other e-mail address, other than that of the poster's account, with the intent to harass or to collect replies.
Creating or forwarding "chain letters," “spam,” "Ponzi," or other "pyramid" schemes of any type.
Providing confidential, non-public information to anyone outside PolyOne. This does not include situations where the information is provided pursuant to a valid confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement in place between the User and the receiving party or where disclosure is required by law.
Engaging in any other activity similar to the above that, in PolyOne’s reasonable judgment, is disruptive to or not in the best interests of its business. This provision is not intended to and will not be used to inhibit or chill employees’ collective action rights or any other rights protected by law.
Exporting or re-exporting data, information, software, firmware, or encryption routines/subroutines in violation of the export control laws of any nation.
Use of Encrypted Internet Conferencing Systems: Phones/VoIP; File Sharing; Audio Phone; Distance Presentations; and Virtual Meetings
Carefully monitor who participates on your Internet Conference. Keep a log of all persons participating in the conference, at beginning and end.
If discussing confidential business information, exclude all persons who are not employees or contractors, unless you have proof of a current and applicable confidentiality agreement with the person or that person's company that applies to all participants in the conference.
If you cannot verify the genuineness of a person logging in to participate in a conference, it is better to exclude that person than to expose PolyOne's or its customers' confidential information to a stranger.
Minimize disclosure of confidential information, especially another company's confidential information given to under a confidentiality agreement -- unless you are sure that such communication is necessary to the purpose of the call and that the persons participating in the conference need to know that information and that the disclosure is not prohibited by the terms of the confidentiality agreement or other agreement.
Do not involve any person, even a employee or contractor, located outside the United States or the country in which you are located until you are sure that no violations of the applicable export laws will occur. To learn more about how to interpret or other Export Control Regulations about export of software or "technical data", please contact the Law Department.
If you do include someone located outside the country in which you are located, please remember that some governments, as a matter of policy, monitor all forms of electronic communication. It may be better to work with that person located outside the country by other means. Please contact the Department for further information about this matter.
If you use electronic files as a part of the Internet Conference, assure the deletion of those files from the archives of the service provider after the conference is over.
Remember: Internet Conferences are just a newer way for distance communication. The value of our confidential information is always greater than the convenience of the use of the Internet. If you are in any situation where you must choose one or the other, please choose keeping our information protected from the prying view of others.

To the maximum extent permitted by law and regulation, all Users, simply by using PolyOne’s Systems, consent to the auditing, interception, or disclosure of electronic or voice communication messages or records contained on or passing through those Systems. Any actual or suspected violation of this policy should be reported immediately to PolyOne’s Department. Consistent with applicable law, any User found to have violated this Policy may be subject to legal action by PolyOne, third parties and/or governmental entities. If you have questions about this policy please contact professionals.
reserves the right in its sole discretion, to amend, suspend, or terminate this Policy, without prior notice to the extent permitted by law.

Policies and Governance
is dedicated to the security of your personal information. The following information will enable you to make informed decisions with respect to email security.
What is Email "spoofing/phishing"?
Fraudulent emails (also known as "spoofing" or "phishing") are those that appear to come from a well-known, reputable source but have the intention of putting your personal information at risk. 
Fraudulent emails and phishing Web pages typically seek to bait you into disclosing your personal info, include a file or link to a
Malicious web site to provide, update or confirm sensitive personal information, such as:
ATM, debit or credit card information
Typically, phishing email will:
Appear to come from a trustworthy company with imagery and links that appear to be legitimate. 
Often the subject line and the message indicate that the email is urgent in nature.
The email will contain what appears to be a convenient link, but it takes the recipient to a fake web site set up by the "Fraudster".
Fraudulent emails will also disguise the sender's email address so it appears to be legitimate.
How do protect myself?
Reputable companies should never ask you to verify or update personal information online.
Call the company via a known good number and ask them about the email.
To report cases of suspected impersonation.
