Global Dream 
Founder Shojiro Ishibashi
At Bridgestone, our dream is to become a truly global enterprise and to establish the brand as the undisputed world No. 1 brand in both name and substance. Across the globe, our entire team is focused on achieving this goal.
The roots of our dream date back to the establishment of Tire Co., Ltd. in 1931. Anticipating the future potential of tires for passenger cars and the international development of the business, founder Shojiro Ishibashi used an English translation of his surname for the name of the company. Even then he may indeed have been dreaming of the future of the Group.
As Japan's automobile industry grew, The Group expanded its business to become Japan's largest tire manufacturer. The company also actively expanded overseas, particularly in Asia. In 1988, the company acquired The Firestone Tire & Rubber Company, a well respected global with a venerable history of its own. This transformed into one of the world's largest tire and rubber companies and created a global team dedicated to serving customers worldwide with the highest level of quality, service and technology.
We hope this introduction to our company will provide you with a deeper understanding of the Group's strengths, as well as our future direction.
                                    Lifelong friends, Harvey Firestone (right), founder of The Firestone Tire & Rubber Company, Thomas Edison (center) and Henry Ford (left)
                                    The “Firestone Boys” proudly show off the new gum-dipped balloon tires that first appeared at the 1925 Indianapolis 500. Firestone brand remains the exclusive tire of the Indianapolis 500 and the IndyCar Series.

“Serving Society with Superior Quality”
We aspire to offer the best for our customers and to society, not only in terms of our products, services and technology, but in all of our corporate activities.
