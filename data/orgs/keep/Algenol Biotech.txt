“is great because … get to work on a variety of challenges facing emerging  technologies within the field, and get to do it with smart, creative, and fun people “
Matthew Anderson – Sr. Research Associate
“am fascinated by the diversity of cyanobacteria and their potential as attractive biofuel production strains. enjoy the international work environment and the option to work in an exciting research area.”
Alexandra Friedrich, Sr. Director, Metabolic Engineering (Berlin)
“Working at has been extremely rewarding, knowing that each and every day we are one step closer to creating a better source of clean energy and green products. This is a scientist’s dream job!  The people work with are amazing—we are like one big family here.  We help each other through challenges and celebrate our accomplishments together.  Seeing an experiment carried out from beginning to end, knowing that had a part in helping us get a little closer to reaching our goals is so fulfilling.”
“enjoy the interdisciplinary aspects of my work as well as being part of an international team of dedicated scientists.”
Torsten Schwecke, Ph.– Associate Director, Analytics Department (Berlin)
