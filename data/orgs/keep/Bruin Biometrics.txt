Say Hello to the
New Standard in
Pressure Ulcer
The Scanner 200 is intended to be used by healthcare professionals as an adjunct to the standard of care when assessing the heels and sacrum of patients who are at increased risk for pressure ulcers.
Interpretation of the ∆ Symbol:
< 0.6 at an anatomical site may suggest the tissue is at lower risk for pressure ulcers
≥ 0.6 at an anatomical site may suggest increased risk for pressure ulcers

Receives Frost & Sullivan Award
BBI's Scanner Cited as a “Revolutionary Game Changer"
BBI, LLC, a developer of innovative sensor-based diagnostic products, today announced that it has won the Frost & Sullivan European New Product Innovation Award for Pressure Ulcer Diagnostics for 2015 for the Scanner, BBI’s “revolutionary” hand-held device for detecting early pressure ulcers.
Decision Follows Drastic Reduction in Pressure Ulcers at Hospitals Using the Scanner
Virgin Care, an independent provider of services to England, today announced that it is equipping nurses with Biometrics’ (BBI) Scanner as its new standard of care for pressure ulcer detection and prevention, following a six-month pilot in which Virgin Care reduced pressure ulcers – a preventable patient safety issue costing the over £2 billion per year – by approximately 95 percent, to nearly zero, with the Scanner.

Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a common medical problem that can lead to pain, disfigurement, infection and death.1 Also known as bedsores or pressure sores, PUs are an area of localised damage to the skin and underlying tissue – usually over and around an area of bony prominence (e.g., sacrum, coccyx, heels, hips) – as a result of pressure with shear and/or friction.2 Bedsores can develop quickly and are often difficult to treat.3 
An Urgent Yet Preventable Problem
In Europe, the prevalence of PUs ranges between 18 -23% in nursing homes and hospitals and can be as high as 57% in critical care units. In the US, they affect an estimated 2.5 million patients in acute care facilities
PUs also can cause complications such as serious infections (sepsis, cellulitis, MRSA) and cancer. In the US, 60,000 patients die each year due to pressure ulcers.
With early risk assessment, approximately 80% of PUs can be prevented. Primary methods of prevention include repositioning the body to redistribute pressure, balanced diet, hydration and keeping the skin free from exposure to moisture.
Clinical Challenges With Today's Standard of Care
The current standard of care in pressure ulcer prevention is based on risk assessment and visual assessment of skin in areas prone to PUs. This approach has several significant challenges:
Low sensitivity (57%)
Specificity (67%)
By the time damage is visually evident, significant tissue damage has already occurred, this is particularly important for:
Deep tissue injury patients
Visual skin assessment is subjective and unreliable as it depends on the clinician's experience and expertise.
These assessments cannot reliably determine which patients are at risk or which patients have existing damage.
Current practice misses opportunities for early risk assessment and early intervention that can prevent PUs. As a result, expensive treatments are often offered to patients who don't need them, and conversely, not offered to those who do need them.
