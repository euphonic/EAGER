One of Hysitron's commitments and core competencies is to promote knowledge in the field of nanomechanics. We do this through exhibiting and participating in conferences, meetings, workshops and tradeshows throughout the year.  We are also committed to research and publish through internal research and key collaborations. Check back here often to find the latest in released papers and when our paths may cross at a conference.
Visit Bruker (Booth #300 and #301) at the 2018 Fall Meeting & Exhibit  to discuss our comprehensive suite of nanomechanical and nanotribological test instruments that enable new frontiers in nanoscale materials characterization, materials development, and process monitoring.
The event covers all aspects of nanomechanical and nanotribological testing. Topics include in-situ experimentation, theory/simulation and biomechanical testing. Nightly social events and a conference dinner provide a valuable forum for networking.

Dr. Oden Warren is the President and Chief Technology Officer at Hysitron, Inc. He received his Ph.in Physical Chemistry in 1993 from Iowa State University of Science & Technology, where he studied as an Amoco Foundation Fellow. His graduate research on surface crystallography of reconstructed thin films earned him an Alpha Chi Sigma Research Excellence Award. Thereafter, he conducted postdoctoral research at Sandia National Laboratories-New Mexico, and at The University of Western Ontario, in the area of interfacial force microscopy.
After joining in 1998, he led the development effort for the TriboIndenter® nanomechanical test instrument, the company's flagship product. In 2005, his concept of a three-dimensional nanomechanical tester received a Nano 50 Award from Nanotech Briefs for the physically realized 3OmniProbe™ product. He is the Principal Investigator for Phase (completed successfully in 2005) and Phase (ongoing) grants awarded by the Department of Energy for the development of quantitative nanoindentation in-situ to a transmission electron microscope. He also represents the company in drafting and standards for instrumented indentation. He has been issued 11 patents, given more than 30 invited talks, and has co-authored more than 70 papers, on nanomechanics, nanotribology, and surface science. Oden's papers have been cited over 2500 times with an h-index of 25. In 2015 Oden received Iowa State University's John Atanasoff Discovery Award, awarded to alumni who have significantly advanced scientific knowledge through laboratory accomplishments and/or management. His latest research interests include optimizing feedback-controlled nanoindentation, enhancing the role of nanoindentation in combinatorial materials science, and understanding fundamental deformation mechanisms through quantitative nanoindentation coupled to transmission electron microscopy. His technical expertise spans the range of nanomechanics, scanning probe microscopy, instrumentation and software development, capacitive transducer and piezoelectric actuator design, and ultra-high vacuum surface science.
