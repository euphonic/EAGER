In high speed direct detection transmission systems is the maximum transmission distance limited by the accumulated chromatic dispersion of the optical fiber. This limitation can be mitigated using Dispersion Slope Compensating Modules (DSCMs) also known as Dispersion Compensating Modules (DCMs). Both long-distance systems based on traditional direct modulation formats as well as systems using more advanced modulation such as PAM4 can benefit from the use of DSCMs.
Very Good Dispersion Compensation over a wide wavelength range
is a market leader in the design and manufacture of standard and custom 
. Our fixed broadband, reconfigurable, and tunable colorless modules round out a product line that is well-suited for the major transmission fiber types.
DSCMs can be delivered in a very small form factor: i.e., on linecards. We also offer a reconfigurable which is suited for networks as well as for laboratory and test purposes.
