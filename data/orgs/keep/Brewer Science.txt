Inside every smartphone, tablet, and notebook computer
is a host of integrated circuits – the little black squares and rectangles that make up the heart, the soul, and the brain of a device. What you see is not the chip itself, but rather the black epoxy resin packaging that insulates and protects the chip inside. The chip is typically a small, thin piece of silicon containing millions of microscopic electrical components and connections.
Before these chips are packaged
and integrated into your electronic device, each one is a single die on part of a much larger piece of silicon called a 
. Building integrated circuits on the wafer surface requires hundreds of steps, many of which involve the use of light to transfer the complex circuit patterns into a photosensitive coating. This process is called 
photolithography
, and it is one of the most critical and challenging steps in the process of manufacturing tiny integrated circuits.
in that silicon wafers are shiny and reflect the light used to create the microscopic circuit patterns on the surface. Chip makers had to find a way to manage the reflections that bounce off the wafer during photolithography.

Control the light. Change the world.

But we didn't stop there.
Controlling light isn’t the only way shines. We are constantly looking for new ways to move technology forward. few other areas where we are making waves include 3-stacking of

“Our customers sometimes ask why Science, a global technology company, would have a passion to promote original artwork. We believe the creativity in art and the creativity in scientific and technological innovations are closely related. Supporting opportunities in our community that stimulate originality, creativity, and diversity are part of Science’s mission.”—Dr. Terry Brewer, President and founder of is deeply committed to making our communities a better place to live and work. We are continually involved in supporting multiple youth, charitable, social service, academic, arts, and athletic organizations. is dedicated to giving not only monetary gifts but also gifts of our time and resources.
S2002, Science, the Springfield Regional Arts Council, and Arts Rolla have hosted an exhibit in Springfield, Missouri, featuring original art and photography from all over the Midwest. The exhibit begins on the First Friday Art Walk in October at The Creamery Arts Center.
"Cultural events provided through the arts enrich the communities and create opportunities for both economic and personal growth.” - Dr. Jacques Thibaud Trio
Each year, invites the Jacques Thibaud Trio to Rolla for an evening of exceptional music. This trio—made up of Hannah Strijbos on viola, Burkhard Maiss on violin, and Bogdan Jianu on cello—is a world-renowned group from Berlin, Germany. To learn more about the Jacques Thibaud Trio, visit 
Supporting science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) programs and raising awareness are of the utmost importance to us at Science. Not only do we open our doors to students and graduates each year with our intern/co-op program, but we also go out into the community to raise awareness and money for local schools. This community outreach program, called Giving Back Through Education, includes hosting a Day Academy at local elementary schools and hosting the local & Art Festival in July of each year, which includes the Mad Scientist 5k Run/Walk and hands-on experiments led by interns. Proceeds from the & Art Festival benefit classrooms at Belle and Vienna, Missouri, schools, with matching a portion of the funds raised.
S2004, has held an annual Chili/Soup Cook-Off to raise money for the Dr. Norman Dobson Memorial Scholarship. Our employees supply various chili and soup dishes for the luncheon, and matches a portion of each monetary donation made. The late Dr. Dobson served as Managing Director of Research & Development at until he lost his struggle with in March 2005. Each year, a student at Missouri State University in Springfield, Missouri, receives the Dr. Norman Dobson Memorial Scholarship to continue his or her studies at the Center for Applied and Engineering (CASE).
In 2014, and the Rolla Robotics Team created the Phil Allen Memorial Robotics Scholarship. The scholarship is sponsored in part, by and the members of the community in memory of employee, Phil Allen who lost his life in a car accident in October of 2014. Each year the scholarship is presented to a graduating college bound Rolla High School senior, who is an active member of the Rolla Robotic team, with a cumulative of 3.0.
