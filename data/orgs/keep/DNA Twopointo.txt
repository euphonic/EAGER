is the leading bioengineering solutions provider. Founded in 2003, (formerly DNA2.0®) offers an integrated pipeline of solutions for the research community, including platforms for protein and vector engineering, products such as expression vectors, fluorescent and chromogenic proteins, cell strains and reagents, as well as gene design, optimization, synthesis and cloning. is based in the US, with a global customer base encompassing academia, government and the pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural and biotechnology industries. is by far the most published synthetic biology vendor, providing expert support to and collaboration with scientists. The company is privately held and is headquartered in Newark, California
With a reverence for the interplay between science, technology and nature, has developed a unique engineering platform based on machine learning and Design of Experiment (DoE).  The ProteinGPS®  proprietary protein engineering technology uses megadimensional, empirical optimization processes to calculate the set of nodes that are information-rich in the relevant space, gene synthesis to make those exact sequences, and machine learning to find the preferred solution. The result: precise engineering of any measurable property in any protein so that it fulfills the exact functional criteria needed for commercialization. The proprietary VectorGPS® technology uses Design-of-Experiment (DoE) algorithms to build testable numbers of vectors from sets of control elements, and advanced machine learning to assess the contribution of each element to vector performance; resulting in custom vectors engineered precisely for individual proteins and expression systems.
While leading the industry in creating value-added applications through protein engineering, vector design and gene synthesis, has also chosen to emphasize customer service as a critical measure of success. The freely available software tool  Gene Designer  and the online , put all the tools and expertise needed for sequence management and design at the fingertips of the user. The company positions itself as a resource and research partner for its customers, to enable accurate and innovative delivery of specific, immediately useful solutions.
