Let's Talk At Materials, plays into everything we do. That's because we take our customers' success personally — working collaboratively to match our expertise in science with their precise needs to provide that are engineered with that endures. We serve as the partner for performance. That means we are more than an expert and more than a preferred source for technically reliable solutions. We are a trusted advisor that applies science, engineering and polymer chemistry insights to a range of exciting new and products across rapidly evolving market opportunities.
Our value is rooted in a rich heritage of technical innovation, production expertise and product excellence that were the hallmarks of the businesses that now comprise Materials. Today, that value is significantly enhanced by our core competency in applying science and polymer chemistry to create the best solutions for our customers’ specific applications. Our goal is to help customers achieve target cost while managing design requirements for optimum long-term performance.
As early as 1911, we were building a reputation for technical excellence and reliable products that met target costs. In the late 1970s, we developed the world's first non-asbestos soft gasket and by 1988 had converted our entire product line to non-asbestos materials.
Similarly, over the past 70 years, predecessor companies to our specialty papers business have rolled out a host of product improvements based on innovative production techniques. For example, they improved the durability of felt backing for flooring and the reliability of electrical barrier and insulation materials. They also developed higher density thermal millboard as well as more resilient matrix and backer boards for flexographic printing.
In the early 1990s, we developed MicroPore® technology, which greatly improved gasket sealability and durability. Later that decade, enhanced MicroPore were developed and tailored to specific applications and markets.
One of the latest innovations to come from this long history of expertise in science and innovative production methods is Select-a-Seal®. It employs a rubber-edge (polymer) on a composite body to create a first-of-its-kind sealing system that is proving more durable and robust than competitive technologies.
Select-a-Seal is one of the latest but certainly will not be the last product to result from our technical tradition. We have intensified our focus on practical solutions. Our investments in research and development continue to result in unique products engineered to meet specific industry needs. global business, offers one of the broadest product lines available, including:
Gasket products for automotive, heavy-duty and industrial markets
Thermal barriers for high temperature applications
Board — the product of choice for securities and currencies printers worldwide
Our technical representatives participate with customers as part of development teams that help to optimize product while minimizing production costs. We take a predictive approach to the product development process: first, we define the requirements, then we work with the customer to create a product to meet those requirements.
Whether we are working to create a new gasketing product or an advanced specialty-paper application, in a typical development process our scientists, chemists and applications engineers bring their collective skills to bear on a customer’s specific needs. We identify a precise combination of — composites, fibers, fillers, polymer binders, etc. — that meet the requirements of a specific application. This preliminary work allows us to design quality into a product even before trial production begins.
Next, when appropriate, we verify under simulated or actual operating conditions using prototypes prepared under controlled conditions. This step enables us to learn how the given combination of ingredients will function together as a product. Often, formulas are tested at our state-of-the-art, 25,000-sq.-ft. Technical Center in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. It is a dedicated facility for testing and development in which researchers can duplicate our production facilities’ manufacturing processes on a small scale. In these instances, because of the small production runs, we can change formulas as necessary, shortening the development time and refining the until they meet our demanding criteria.
is fully committed to maintaining strong policies that protect the environment by:
Complying with all applicable laws, regulations and other requirements concerning the protection of the environment.
Conducting our operations in a manner that prevents pollution. 
Ensuring that all of our and products are 100% asbestos free and 100% solvent free.
Utilizing a Continual Improvement process to benefit the environment and the community.
Our corporate management team members are experienced in the business segments they manage. They and the managers at each of our manufacturing sites share Materials' commitment to environmental stewardship and to customer satisfaction by developing quality products through quality processes.
was founded on the concept of responsibility to the customer and a philosophy that quality comes first. Therefore, a commitment to quality underlies every one of the company’s research, production and business processes.
Our processes and products have been audited and meet the quality standards of leading customer quality programs worldwide. We use rigorous testing to simulate real world product and provide a quality certificate of on every shipment of materials. Technical experts have run thousands of hours of functional tests to validate our products’ quality and long-term durability. The result: robust solutions that perform reliably, and affordably satisfy the most stringent requirements.Menu
