Eurofins is an innovative company that develops, manufactures, and commercializes reagents, complete cell-based assay kits, profiling and screening services as well as other turnkey solutions for the drug discovery, screening, and life science markets. Our biochemical and cell-based assays enable customers to improve research productivity and effectiveness of their screening, lead optimization and campaigns, thus accelerating the discovery and development of new drugs. Plus, with the addition of the BioMAP® platform of human primary cell systems for phenotypic profiling, Eurofins offers a powerful tool to deliver physiologically relevant insights and integrated solutions for all stages of discovery from target and lead discovery to preclinical and beyond.
Acquired by Eurofins Pharma Discovery Services in 2017, Eurofins is dedicated to the development and commercialization of innovative solutions for discovery research.
The Company pioneered the use of β-galactosidase enzyme fragment complementation (EFC) for discovery research. technology is a proven, established screening platform in most major pharmaceutical companies and our EFC-based HitHunter
 cassays are the market leader in screening applications. PathHunter
 and InHunter™ technology platforms, an adaptation of technology, are an innovative and comprehensive assay system that enables live cell-based assays for pathway profiling and compound screening.
In addition to the platform, Eurofins also holds extensive intellectual property for its second core technology, an
 binding assay platform called KINOME
. Through our core technologies, Eurofins is able to offer assay solutions for every major class of drug target, including GPCRs, kinases, bromodomains, methyltranseferases, proteases, nuclear hormone receptors, cytokines, transcription factors and secreted proteins.
Corporate Partnerships
Eurofins remains committed to fully exploit the commercial potential of its as well as KINOME
 technology either solely or with its corporate partners.  Eurofins values such partnerships and is actively seeking additional collaborative alliances to commercialize and provide early access to new technology platforms in the drug discovery and development markets.
