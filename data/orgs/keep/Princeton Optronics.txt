The mobile handset market will continue to 
trend to ever higher screen-to-body 
 and ultimately to all-screen, bezel-less smartphones. Technology 
 ambient light, color and proximity sensing solutions to operate behind displays used in these next generation mobile handsets.
 The new TCS3701 enables front-facing ambient light and proximity sensing measurements in smartphones – maximizing edge-to-edge display screen size – with sensor operation under display.
Accurate color sensors from ams enable display controllers to shift the white point of the display in response to changes in the color temperature of ambient light: the effect is to make text as readable on the display as it is when printed in a book. 
By shifting the display’s white point to a warmer color temperature, in which there is less blue light, the display controller also minimizes eye strain caused by prolonged viewing, and can reduce the risk of sleep disturbance attributable to use of the display. 
An infrared proximity sensor in a mobile phone is used to disable the display when the phone is raised to the user’s ear for a voice call. Proximity sensors from ams operate through a very small aperture: this keeps optical cross-talk to very low levels, almost eliminating the risk of false detection events. 
The small aperture optical sensing devices from ams are based on a refined analog front end and digital circuitry, and innovative package design techniques, producing the lowest possible noise floor. 
The same ability to operate through a small aperture is provided by the ams ambient light sensing and color sensor products, which support display management functions while enabling new mobile phone designs to benefit from a sleek look with barely visible apertures.
