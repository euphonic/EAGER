Curais an innovative company founded to take a newly discovered technique for creating therapeutic vaccines against autoimmune diseases from discovery through to being available for treatment of humans.
Typical autoimmune diseases that should be treatable by Curavaccines include myasthenia gravis, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosis.
The first in human trial of the therapeutic vaccine is ongoing.
Through this web site, Curaaims to bring its activities to the attention of the wider public who wants to know 
 Curaand its 
 and to offer an

In 2009, the myasthenia gravis therapeutic vaccine, the first vaccine in a series, was granted 
 Orphan Drug Designation in Europe
 by a team of 27 independent experts of the 27 European member states.
In 2011, the therapeutic vaccine was granted 
Orphan Drug Designation in the USA
 by the FDA.
In 2013, following a call for proposals that was answered by all the best medicine projects in the world, CuraVac’s project for a therapeutic vaccine was one of the 7 therapeutic vaccine projects that were selected by an Independent Jury Committee of the best world experts.
Curacreated a European consortium of four companies and one University Medical Center that receives the support of the FP7 2013 Health Innovation to conduct clinical trials of the therapeutic vaccine :

He joined the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) faculty in 1986 as Professor of Physiology and Biophysics and in 2009 became Professor of Medicine. He has been adjunct Professor at Auburn University and Utrecht University (NL). His areas of research centre on rational drug and vaccine design.
Professor Blalock is a renowned scientist with more than 300 scientific publications in top ranked peer reviewed scientific journals and whose work has been funded all through out his career.
Amongst his most notable discoveries is “The immune system as a sixth sense”. discovery for which he has gained the respect of the scientific community and for which he was invited to open the Nobel Symposium in 2004.
Professor Blalock received his and Ph.degrees in 1971 and 1976, respectively, from the University of Florida. After one year postdoctoral training at the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, he joined the faculty in 1977, and earned the title of Professor of Microbiology in 1984.

Word CloudAbout CuraCurawas created to develop the medical and commercial potential of a newly discovered technique for the production of therapeutic vaccines for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
The company was founded by a Belgian medical doctor, Dr. Stéphane Huberty, who himself suffered from myasthenia gravis. The original discoverer of the vaccine production technique, Professor Edwin Blalock is a consultant to CuraVac.
This vaccine is the first in a series. It will be tested on humans suffering from myasthenia gravis (MG). While a not widely known orphan disease, affects more than one in five thousand and its pathology is clearly understood, making it an excellent development model.
Further, Curatherapeutic vaccines will be developed for the treatment of other autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. In total, autoimmune diseases afflict more than five percent of western population.
In 2002, the company was created and acquired the complementary peptide patent. The company raised fund and got organized as a management company in the center of a expertise and competence network of collaborations and sub-contracting companies.
In 2006, the key article showing that the vaccine works not only in lab on rat models but also on naturally occurring myasthenia gravis in pet dogs is published and the vaccine patent in filled.
In 2009, the human formulation of the vaccine is manufactured following and guidelines.
The myasthenia gravis therapeutic vaccine, our first vaccine, was granted Orphan Drug Designation in Europe by a team of 27 independent experts of the 27 European member states.
In 2013, following a call for proposals that was answered by all the best medicine projects in the world, CuraVac’s project for a therapeutic vaccine was one of the 7 therapeutic vaccine projects that were selected by an Independent Jury Committee of the best world experts.
Following a Clinical Trial Authorization received in November 2015, 24 patients are received three injections of the therapeutic vaccine in a phase 1b clinical trial that takes place at the Antwerp University hospital (UZA) in Belgium.A
