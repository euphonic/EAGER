Understanding and Protecting IP
is the intellectual property and commercialization unit of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. NUtech’s mission is to facilitate the commercialization and practical use of innovations generated through the research activities at the University of Nebraska. We do this by identifying, evaluating, protecting, marketing and licensing intellectual property to promote economic development and improve the quality of life. Further, also connects innovators with the people, coaching and resources they need to start companies, develop products and create jobs. If you’re interested in starting a company, seeing your innovations licensed or securing developmental funding for your leading-edge research, we can help you connect with potential industry partners, entrepreneurs and investors. We can add value to your research by enabling a fully collaborative process for joint creation, development and commercialization so your technologies can change the world.
