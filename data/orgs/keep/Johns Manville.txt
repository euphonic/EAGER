In 1858, 21-year-old Henry Ward “set up shop” in the basement of his New York City tenement building. Using his wife’s new clothes wringer and a household tea kettle, he applied hot tar to cloth and created the company’s first roofing shingles. By 1868, he had moved operations out of the basement and was on his way to success with the award of his first patent for an asbestos product – the foundation for Manville’s business for the next 100 years.
In 1886, Charles and his three sons founded a pipe insulation company in Milwaukee called the Covering Company. soon became a selling agent for products made by Johns’ company. Fifteen years later, the two organizations merged and became the Johns-Corporation (JM). Under the family’s leader ship, the company's product line expanded to include sheet packaging for cylinders, brake linings, asbestos cement and acoustical products. Sales grew to $45 million and profits were in excess of $3.3 million before went public on the New York Stock Exchange in 1927. 
In the decades that followed, the company continued to challenge itself with a focus on innovation and a refusal to be satisfied with the status quo. survived and even thrived through difficult times including the American Civil War, two world wars, the great depression and most significantly, the advent and demise of the “miracle mineral” – asbestos. The lessons learned from the asbestos odyssey helped foster the commitment to health and safety that we continue to live by today. 
In 2001, became a wholly owned subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which gave us a strong financial foundation and renewed our commitment to providing innovative solutions for our customers’ needs. In 2018, as we celebrate our 160
 anniversary, we are focused on developing new products to reduce energy costs, improve indoor air quality, conserve energy and provide comfort. At our state-of-the-art research and development facility in Littleton, Colorado, our engineers and building scientists are leading the way – continually building on our leadership position in the sustainable building products industry. We are confident our most significant accomplishments are yet to come.

California Transparency in Supply Chains Act
California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (657)
 was designed to increase the amount of information made available by manufacturers and retailers regarding their efforts to address the issue of slavery and human trafficking in their direct supply chain. This information allows consumers to make better, more-informed choices regarding the products they buy and the companies they choose to support.
At (JM), we believe that workers at our facilities as well as those of our direct suppliers have the right to freely choose employment.  It is our policy not to purchase materials that have been produced with slave, forced or child labor or labor that has resulted from human trafficking. Accordingly, is taking the following efforts regarding 657 and our supply chain in general:
Verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery
: uses internal supplier audits and checklists to verify the qualifications of certain existing and potential future suppliers.  Although these processes do not specifically focus on trafficking and slavery, if became aware of a circumstance involving this conduct in our supply chain, will conduct an investigation and take appropriate remedial action.  
Audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards for trafficking and slavery in supply chains
: implements a risk-based internal audit program for suppliers in our direct supply chain.  Although the audit program does not specifically focus on trafficking and slavery, if observed, this conduct would not be tolerated, and appropriate recourse taken.  
Compliance certification: 
has purchasing agreements or purchase order terms and conditions in place with all our direct suppliers requiring them to comply with all applicable laws and regulations as a general rule of engagement. This compliance includes laws regarding forced labor and child labor. The company does not have a formal certification process.  
Standards and procedures: 
Any supplier or employee found to be in noncompliance with either our terms and conditions or our policy against slavery and human trafficking, whether that violation was detected via self disclosure or through our audit process, will be reviewed for compliance action, which may result in termination of the relationship or employment.
 provides training on human trafficking and slavery (particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of our products) to those company employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management. Further, we require all salaried employees to complete our annual Code of Conduct training and certification and we have an internal process for enforcement of misconduct.
