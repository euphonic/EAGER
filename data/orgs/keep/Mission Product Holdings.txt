Our About COOL.
You’re leading an active lifestyle.  That means you get hot.  That’s where we come in.  We are pioneers in instant cooling innovations and solutions, which are portable, effective and re-usable to help everyone who competes, plays or works in the heat.  We study the heat and its effect on your ability to enjoy or work in the sun.  In fact, our apparel and accessories are specifically designed to keep you cool and comfortable in even the hottest conditions.
Every stitch and seam has a reason. Our ergonomically designed styles are engineered to be ultra-soft, lightweight and to cool you down - instantly.  At we work with scientist and world-class athletes to develop temperature controlling technologies and then apply these solutions to on-trend, stylish apparel, and accessories.  Lab tested in our state at the state of the art Heat Lab at the University of Connecticut and then proven on the field by our co-founders and the world’s greatest athletes Serena Williams, Dwyane Wade and Drew Brees, our products are designed to cool you fast and keep you comfortable for hours. 
MISSION: to keep you cool in everything you do.
