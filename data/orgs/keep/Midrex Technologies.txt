For more than four decades, has been the world technology leader for direct reduction and continues provide innovative and improvements for today’s global steel industry. continues to lead the industry by offering the best direct reduction technology solutions to meet steelmakers’ needs.
Built on an elegant and simple process, MIDREX® is designed to meet current steelmaker needs while being flexible to adapt to tomorrow’s markets.  Plants using the MIDREX® Process are the world’s largest, most flexible and longest running direct reduction plants in the industry. Of the 67 MIDREX® Plants built and started-up since 1969, only 3 have ever been dismantled and taken completely out of service. In fact, 33 MIDREX® Plants have been operating more than 20 years and some are in their fourth decade of operation.
Technology innovation is fundamental to and is the cornerstone of the technology’s success.  The MIDREX® Process can utilize either natural gas or coal with MXCOL® to produce quality DRI, and  It is the only process that provides the ability to simultaneously produce any combination of product types with instantaneous adjustment of discharge rates.  It can use the widest range of oxide pellets and lump and has three hot transport solutions for a variety of site layouts, all of which minimize fines generation.menu

has built its business on a “renewable technology” concept, a self-sustaining cycle that blends science, engineering and real world experience to constantly renew and improve technologically sound processes and systems. The MIDREX® Technology Cycle is powered by the spirit of innovation that is centered on the Research & Development Technology Center, located in Pineville, North Carolina, USA.
Over the past four decades Technologies, Inc. has risen to meet the industry’s need by supplying and continually innovating the world’s most reliable and productive Direct Reduction Technology: The MIDREX® Process. The MIDREX® Process is unsurpassed in the Direct Reduction industry in terms of production and process flexibility to meet the constantly evolving nature of steelmakers and ore-based metallics providers.
Building Plants - Project Development, Execution & Continued Operational Support
Technology is our Business. Through our in-house capabilities as well as strategic partners, can help with all aspects of project development from contracting to commissioning.  It takes innovation, insight and a passion for excellence to harness the potential of technology. It also takes experience, expertise and pride in providing solutions to successfully deliver a project on time and on spec, while continuing to support it and its operators for years after.
NG™, the natural gas-based configuration of the MIDREX® Process, is the most widely-used technology for the production of all forms of direct reduced iron (DRI) products. Each year, MIDREX® Plants produce more than 60% of the entire world’s and more than 80% of the produced by all shaft furnace technologies.
Syngas, or synthesis gas, is a gas mixture consisting of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide resulting from the gasification of a carbon-containing fuel. commercially offers technology utilizing syngas derived from natural gas and coal sources. These include: MXCOL® , COREX® / MXCOL® and the new MIDREX® Thermal Reactor System™ (TRS® ). MXCOL® can use reducing gas from several sources of syngas: commercial gasifiers using a variety of low cost fuels, export gas from the coal-based COREX® Hot Metal Process by Siemens Metals GmbH, and the innovative MIDREX® Thermal Reactor System™ (TRS® ).
Over the past several decades, production and products have evolved to meet growing steelmaking needs. As steelmaking increases, with its high metallic iron content, adjustable carbon level and consistent chemical and physical characteristics provides steelmakers the broad flexibility to tailor their furnace charges to market conditions as well as giving them the ability to produce higher quality steels than would be possible with scrap alone.
MIDREX® Hot Discharge Plants can be equipped with a hot transport vessel (HTV) system to minimize temperature loss and to prevent re-oxidation of while being transferred to an meltshop over distances greater than 100 meters. The vessels typically have a capacity of 45-90 metric tons and are moved to the meltshop on specially designed vehicles. They operate under inert conditions throughout the entire fill - transport - discharge cycle.
MIDREX® Hot Discharge Plants can be equipped with a hot transport conveyor (HTC) system to minimize temperature loss and to prevent re-oxidation of while being transferred to an meltshop up to a distance of 200 meters. The proven hot transport conveyor supplied by Aumund Fördertechnik Gmbhas been used successfully with impressive results at multiple installations. The system has several advantages over a pneumatic transport system including lower investment cost, lower energy and maintenance costs- and less fines generation.
The HOTLINK® System delivers to an adjacent at up to 700° by positioning the MIDREX® Shaft Furnace just outside and above the exterior wall of the meltshop. is discharged hot into a surge bin and then fed directly to the with minimal heat loss. Low velocity gravity transfer keeps physical degradation of to a minimum, and there is no re-oxidation of the due to the sealed design of the HOTLINK® System. The HOTLINK® System is designed with options to produce hot briquetted iron (HBI) or cold (CDRI) without stopping production when the is offline.
