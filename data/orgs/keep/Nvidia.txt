get to work on the biggest events that hosts – like CES, in Las Vegas, and Computex, in Taipei – where we're able to show off our products and vision to thousands of visitors each day. It's always a scramble, but we usually knock it out of the park, thanks to a global events team that's the envy of the industry.
initially came here as an intern and returned when finished my doctorate in parallel computing models with GPUs. love the challenge of learning something new each day, assessing where the problems are, and figuring out how GPUs can make things work faster. The best part of my job is that we help scientists help change the world.
After joining as a computer vision engineer, moved to researching autonomous driving, focused on vision technologies inside the car. Our work led to improving systems for human-computer interactions, and eventually new products. When was ready to broaden my leadership skills, was asked to be the program chair of our internal engineering conference. It’s an awesome event that brings together hundreds of our best engineers from all over the company to connect and showcase their innovative work.
Before my current role managing our and research, held R&roles in both our Research and groups. really love serving as technical program chair for our annual internal engineering conference - we use it to bring together our engineering community to share ideas and showcase innovation. This is a really exciting place to be. We continue to develop the world's most advanced processors.
Coming here as an intern more than a decade ago, got a chance to work in departments throughout the company. It exposed to me to a range of disciplines pretty quickly. realized that product engineering is my real love, and that's what I'm doing now. It brings me great joy to know I'm making a real contribution to the world through technical innovation every day.
signed on under the New College Grads training program, which gave me exposure to a variety of business units and disciplines, including software, hardware, programming and design. The culture of teamwork here has helped shape my career path. Now, I'm focused on creating faster, more power efficient GPUs and on mentoring team members.
Deep learning is changing the world – and is at the heart of it. Healthcare, energy, automotive and beyond – they’re all working to harness deep learning. And we’re working with all of them. love being at a company that’s driving the next computing revolution.
Fresh out of school with a master's degree, came here as an intern and never left. NVIDIA's given me the chance to work in lots of roles, including graphics drivers, managing chip design, engineering training and software security. After nearly two decades, there are still plenty of growth opportunities. I’m excited to explore deep learning methods for platform security. Artificial Intelligence Computing Leadership from 0
