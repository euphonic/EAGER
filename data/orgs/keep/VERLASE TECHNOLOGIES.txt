is a new company working to develop a breakthrough technology for color conversion in Laser Diodes and LEDs. Using novel materials and processes, color conversion layers for micro-displays and surface emitting laser diodes able to emit directly in the green wavelengths are an early focus.  
The Company was founded by Versatilis ( http://www.versatls.com ) with a first private investment round led by Wakley Limited, after years of R&by the Company's principals in advanced materials and processes for enabling semiconductor devices on large area, flexible substrates.
