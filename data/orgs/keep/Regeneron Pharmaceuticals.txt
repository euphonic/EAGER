(NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases. Founded and led for 30 years by physician-scientists, our unique ability to repeatedly and consistently translate science into medicine has led to seven FDA-approved treatments and numerous product candidates in development, all of which were homegrown in our laboratories. Our medicines and pipeline are designed to help patients with eye diseases, allergic and inflammatory diseases, cancer, cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, neuromuscular diseases, infectious diseases and rare diseases.
is accelerating and improving the traditional drug development process through our proprietary 
 which produces optimized fully-human antibodies, and ambitious research initiatives such as the Genetics Center, which is conducting one of the largest genetics sequencing efforts in the world.

: Top 10 Most Innovative Companies, 2017
We are the only biopharmaceutical company to be led by physician-scientists for more than 30 years. We consistently demonstrate our commitment to scientific excellence by counting multiple Nobel Laureates and five members of the National Academy of Sciences among our leadership, as well as being one of the first companies to form a Science and Technology Committee as an integral component of its Board, a practice which has since become industry standard. 
From our first days, science has remained our central guiding principle.

We are committed to bringing important new medicines to people with serious diseases.
Before a new treatment is widely available to the public, it undergoes years of rigorous clinical testing to satisfy the safety and efficacy criteria required for regulatory approval. Approval by a country or region's health regulatory authority, such as the Food and Drug Administration, allows the appropriate group of people to access a medicine.
In some cases, a potentially beneficial therapy may not yet be approved by regulatory authorities. Therefore, has established a Compassionate Use Policy to help provide access to an investigational medical product, with the required permission from a health regulatory authority.
In the USA, this type of compassionate use program is also known as an Expanded Access Program (EAP) and is intended for patients with serious or life-threatening conditions who do not have any viable or available treatment options, and are unable to participate in ongoing clinical trials. To view a list of Regeneron’s open clinical trials, visit clinicaltrials.gov .
To ensure the safety of patients, we have developed certain criteria to evaluate Compassionate Use requests. All such requests are required to be in accordance with local laws and regulations, as well as with Policies. While is committed to reviewing each request carefully, fairly and on a case-by-case basis, we cannot guarantee access to any specific investigational medical product by any individual patient.
Requests for compassionate use must be initiated by a treating physician, so if you are a patient or caregiver, please ask your doctor for support in this process. Physicians should send compassionate use requests to CompassionateUse_Requests@regeneron.com . will acknowledge receipt of a physician’s request within five business days.
There is sufficient data to expect that the investigational medical product will have a favorable benefit-risk profile.
The regulatory agency in the country where the patient resides must also approve the proposed use of the investigational drug, when required.
Providing the investigational medical product will not interfere with or compromise its clinical development. This means that adequate supply of the investigational medical product must be available to perform necessary clinical studies before access is provided through the Compassionate Use program.
There is a legitimate medical need documented and submitted by the treating physician.
The physician initiating the Compassionate Use request and providing treatment must be qualified in terms of background, education, and experience to carry out the proposed protocol.
The initiating physician agrees to assume all responsibilities and obligations to comply with the relevant regulatory requirements.
is committed to supporting patients with serious diseases and ensuring that patients are able to access the medicines they need.
Bringing Attention to a Debilitating Disease
The Understand national initiative aims to increase awareness and understanding of atopic dermatitis (AD), in partnership with the National Eczema Association (NEA) and the Dermatology Nurses’ Association (DNA). The most common form of eczema, is a chronic inflammatory disease with symptoms often appearing as a rash on the skin. The initiative offers a glimpse into the daily struggle of life with and connects people to helpful resources such as the NEA.
Education & Awareness for Cholesterol Management
In 2016, and Sanofi committed to support the American Heart Association’s cholesterol education program, Check.Change.Control.Cholesterol, which aims to drive millions of Americans to better cholesterol management. The three-year program will engage patients, caregivers and healthcare practitioners, and provide valuable educational resources to communities across the country.
Fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP) is an exceedingly rare disease in which bone forms in the muscle and connective tissue. Over time, people living with gradually lose the ability to move and even breathe as their rib cage loses flexibility. When discovered that the protein Activin-played a role in triggering FOP, we made it a priority to reach out to the small but strong community to understand their daily struggles and treatment expectations. Since then, organizations such as the International Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva Association (IFOPA) and the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) have been integral to informing the development of our investigational candidate REGN2477 and to helping us keep patient needs front and center in our efforts. We’ve also given back to the community with grants and by sharing our genetically modified mouse model with other scientists to advance basic and translational research. Through these mutually supportive relationships, we have come together with the community to fight this devastating disease.
