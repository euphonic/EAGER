Dr. Jeff Ellis leads a research group in Plant Industry, Australia that was among the first to clone and characterize plant disease resistance genes and describe their products as a new class of nucleotide binding site-leucine rich repeat proteins.  His laboratory developed the Activator tagging system for cloning of the L6 and rust resistance genes in flax in 1994 and 1997.  L6 was one of the first cloned genes. Since this time, the group has isolated a number of further genes that control other rust resistance specificities and have investigated the molecular basis of gene-for-gene resistance specificity through the study of chimeric alleles in transgenic flax, showing that the leucine-rich repeat region is the main player.  Dr. Ellis and his research team remain one of the leading laboratories in plant disease resistance research and this team has recently isolated and characterized the flax rust avirulence genes that correspond to the flax L5, L6 L7 and resistance genes and using yeast hybrid analysis, demonstrated that there is direct interaction between L6 and AvrL567 proteins.  In addition to working with the model flax-flax rust system and the fundamental basis of rust resistance, the Ellis group has a strong grains industry focus on the delivery of improved rust resistance in wheat through increased efficiency of resistance breeding based on gene cloning and transfer and marker technology.  Dr. Ellis was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in May, 2009.

We teach crops how to fight more plant diseases
At 2Blades, we pursue a better understanding of plant pathogens and the best solutions to the diseases they cause. The insights we find, which are at times unexpected or difficult to predict, provide new strategies for keeping plants healthy. 
2works to apply these innovations to the breeding of significant crops for commercial and subsistence agriculture. We seek to get these healthier plants into the hands of farmers all over the world, so that farmers can stop losing crops to disease and can grow more efficiently with less need for crop protection chemicals.
Fighting crop disease is an important part of a sustainable system for producing food now and in the future, as the world works to feed more people and conserve our natural resources.
2was established in 2004 as a 501(c)3 charitable organization to implement practical uses of important innovations in plant science that address the rising incidence of crop disease.  
Remarkable advances have been realized in plant science over the past twenty years, including genome sequencing, molecular marker technologies, and tools for genome engineering.  These advances have vastly improved the understanding of plants and their interaction with pathogens, and they create opportunities for better means of breeding for durable disease resistance.  Yet typically these opportunities have stalled at the basic research stage.
      “Technology transfer from lab bench to marketplace has historically been underdeveloped within the agricultural research enterprise.”  President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, The White House
Working together with world leading scientists in plant-pathogen interactions, 2has scouted and supported the most significant advances in the understanding of plant disease and immunity, as well as enabling technologies to develop disease resistant crops.
