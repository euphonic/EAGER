Revolutionizing the Animal Microbiome
Founded in 2009, Midori is a Flagship VentureLabs Company pioneering a novel category of products that modulate the animal microbiome to improve health and nutrition.  For the production industry, our technology improves the economics, quality, and sustainability of animal protein without resorting to widespread use of antibiotics and other drugs.  For our dear companion animals, it promises better health, nutrition, and quality of life.
