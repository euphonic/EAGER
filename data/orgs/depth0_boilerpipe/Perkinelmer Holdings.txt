The Impact of Data Quality on Analytics
|

The rapid rise in digital data capture and visual analytics platforms has created new possibilities for managing the enterprise in a profitable manner. However, the journey from data to insights from data is unique for each enterprise. The most critical contributor to this experience is data or rather, the quality of data. There is no single definition of data quality since it is tightly linked to the context and purpose of data collection. A higher diversity of contexts within an organization, or project, means an increase in the elasticity of the definition of data quality. The parameters of quality can change from organization to organization or even within an organization, it can vary from business, technical or support functions. This often leads to a disconnect between the data collection and usage objectives, becoming the Achilles’ heel in the implementation of enterprise level analytics projects..
