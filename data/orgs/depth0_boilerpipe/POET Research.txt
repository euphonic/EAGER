POET RESEARCH CENTER
POET Research Center, located in Scotland, SD, was the first commercial scale ethanol plant in South Dakota. POET purchased the plant in 1987 and it began operating again in 1988. After extensive expansions and updates, it is now producing more than 9 times its original capacity.
POET develops turn-key ethanol plant design, engineering, construction, management and marketing projects with their network of plants. POET Research Center produces high performance, environmentally-friendly POET ethanol using our BPX™ and BFRAC™ technologies, as well as a premium, high-quality Dakota Gold® brand livestock feed for regional, national and international markets.
In addition to producing these POET products, POET Research Center is also used as a research and development facility. POET's state-of-the-art technology used across its plant network often comes through the efforts of the POET Research Center.
