Sun Synchrony develops innovative concentrating photovoltaic solar panels to provide clean, safe, and reliable energy using a fraction of the space of conventional silicon products, while lowering materials and energy inputs to manufacturing.
Our products combine  the exceptional efficiency of state-of-the-art broad-spectrum multi-junction photovoltaic cells with the compact profile and ease of installation of fixed panels using our unique SunSynchronousTM sun-tracking  and focusing technology. By eliminating bulky and expensive external trackers, our ArcSolTM Panel will bring high-efficiency concentrated solar power to space-constrained markets that have been poorly served by conventional PV panels.
