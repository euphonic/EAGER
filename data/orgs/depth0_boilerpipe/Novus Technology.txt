#3 Disaster Recovery, Backups & Anti-virus
When small businesses think about disaster recovery or backups, it's usually after a disaster has occurred. Whether it's the data on your laptop, your CRM database or your entire infrastructure, novus[tek] has solutions to meet all situations and budgets. This is one of those things you can't afford to ignore. With the ever growing threat of ransomware and carrying our lives around on our smart devices, it's important that businesses stay protected not only in the work place but at home. You may be taking every effort necessary to stay safe, but what about the other devices on your network?
#4 Network Solutions
  Our certified technicians deliver the best computer network services in San Diego and guarantee that your network is running at optimum performance. Regardless if you'll be operating in the cloud or with on premise servers, you'll need a well-built highway to operate on. Poor WiFi signal? Internet going out on a daily basis? Can't print? Want to throw your system out the window? These are all symptoms of poorly built networks which means you're losing productivity and money.
