We heard you.
Eye diseases such as uveitis, retinal vein occlusion and diabetic macular edema present in the choroid and retina. Through the ingenious efforts of our research and development team, we have developed a unique and elegant way to access to the choroid and retina through the suprachoroidal space to treat these diseases.
CLS-TA administered by suprachoroidal injection is currently under investigation in clinical trials.
