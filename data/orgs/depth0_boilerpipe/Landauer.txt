The LANDAUER CDOS team provides a one-on-one experience that can’t be beat.
Olav takes the time to teach and brings the experience of other hospitals to bear. With his help, we keep up with regulatory issues, including being ready for The Joint Commission survey. After attending the 2017 Clinical Dose Optimization Symposium and hearing Olav speak, I defined more precisely my role as Quality Assurance Technologist and now serve at multiple sites for UPH Peoria. I’m excited to put new protocols in place and teach my colleagues – and continue to rely on Olav’s expertise.”
