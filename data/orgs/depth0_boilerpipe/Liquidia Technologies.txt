Liquidia does.
What if you could replace five formulation platforms with one?
Our PRINT Technology does.
A Simple Elegant Solution for Addressing Challenges in Drug Delivery
Liquidia Technologies is a late-stage clinical biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of human therapeutics using our proprietary PRINT technology to transform the lives of patients. PRINT technology is a particle engineering platform that enables precise production of uniform drug particles designed to improve the safety, efficacy and performance of a wide range of therapies. Currently, Liquidia is developing two product candidates from its own pipeline : LIQ861 for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and LIQ865 for the treatment of local post-operative pain. In addition to developing our own product candidates, Liquidia collaborates with leading pharmaceutical companies to apply our PRINT technology across a wide range of therapeutic areas, molecule types and routes of administration.
