The spirit of collaboration that CSEM has shown has been excellent and I would specifically like to commend the center.
I would like to thank CSEM for the support it provided for the Rio Tinto campaign. The spirit of collaboration that CSEM has shown has been excellent and I would specifically like to commend the center for the preparation of the pre-testing as well as for the actual testing in Rio Tinto [...] not to mention the very good data we have recorded using LTMS. All in all a very good analogue simulation, which should be the basis of future activities.

ONERA—The French aerospace lab
CSEM has the advantage of being used to working with industry and brought us their expertise in the domain of nanosurface engineering.
ONERA, the French aerospace lab, is developing—together with CSEM—new pressure-sensitive coatings as unique tools for providing pressure measurements over the entire surface of a model subjected to aerodynamic testing in wind tunnels. In this project, the main objective is to design a specific pressure-sensitive coating able to measure the fast pressure variations (>1 kHz) observed in an unsteady aerodynamic flow. CSEM's technological contribution complements the technical wind tunnel expertise and experience of ONERA.

Osmotex
Osmotex was able to identify CSEM as the ideal partner. We have now launched our first series of micro-pumps on the market, and have relocated to Switzerland to further intensify our successful collaboration with CSEM.
To develop our proprietary electrokinetic micro-pump concept, our Norwegian start-up was looking for a partner with expertise in the fields of microfluidics, electrokinetics, and micro-integration. Thanks to this worldwide search, Osmotex was able to identify CSEM as the ideal partner to provide all these technologies. We have now launched our first series of micro-pumps on the market, and have relocated to Switzerland to further intensify our successful collaboration with CSEM.
