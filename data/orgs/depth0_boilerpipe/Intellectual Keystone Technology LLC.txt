Today's business demands access to proven intellectual property (IP) to protect its R&D and product development costs.
IKT helps your company gain access to various proven IP assets to enable your company to focus on innovative product development and maintain high level of productivity.
Our Mission & Operating Principles
An operating technology company in a highly competitive market place invariably faces a multitude of IP-related threats that can create unpredictable financial risks and even jeopardize the livelihood of the company.  And, developing an effective IP strategy to gain access to potentially risky IP portfolios - whether through acquisition or licensing - is a key to success in today's competitive business environment.
Our mission is simple -- i.e., to facilitate access to fundamental, proven technologies at a fraction of the cost that a company is otherwise required to expend to develop them on its own. With this mission in mind, our team of technical and IP experts, who has accumulated extensive experience and know-how in the global IP arena, strives to identify, develop, and aggregate IP portfolios that are critical and indispensable to a number of technology companies and to offer licensing at fair and reasonable terms or even acquisition opportunities.  We thus spread the IP risks and costs across our extensive network of technology companies.
We make sure to keep our eye on changes in technology and IP law, as that is what keeps us current and your company competitive.
