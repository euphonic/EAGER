The potential to save lives
The Magnetically-Enhanced Diffusion (MED) system â„¢ is designed to improve the fluid dynamics in stagnant flow vessels by using patented magnet-based technology to convey intravenously administered, iron-oxide MED MicroBeads and clot-busting drugs at a much faster rate than otherwise possible. This promises to improve care for stroke and other diseases.
MED Application in Acute Ischemic Stroke
Designed to improve clinical results
Immediate
Time is of the essence when combatting stroke, heart disease and other cardiovascular conditions.
Magnet technology built upon 40+ years of clinical experience with biologically-safe intravenous iron.
Easy to Use
Unlike other technologies, the MED system is simple and doesn't require a specialist.
Supported by NIH awards
New Hope for Stroke Patients
Pulse Therapeutics is developing a breakthrough medical device designed to significantly improve the conveyance of clot-busting drugs, like tPA, in the emergency department (ED). By eliminating clots earlier, patient outcomes have been shown to be greatly improved.
