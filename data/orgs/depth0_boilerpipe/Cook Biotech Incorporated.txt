Restoring tissue. Improving life.
Cook Biotech Inc. is dedicated to providing advanced tissue-repair products for improving patient outcomes globally. Our products are manufactured using proprietary extracellular matrix (ECM) technologies and manufacturing processes. They are derived from porcine small intestinal submucosa (SIS) and other ECM-based biomaterials.
We collaborate with partners and distributors to make our products available under several brand names, including: AxoGuard®, Biodesign®, DynaMatrix®, FISH™, HaloShield™, OASIS®, and tarSys™.
Partners and distributors include Aziyo Biologics, AxoGen Inc., Cook Medical Inc., Katena Products Inc., Keystone Dental Inc., Smith & Nephew Inc., and Morris Innovative.
Product applications range across the body, including those for head, neck, torso, abdomen, arms, hands, legs, and feet.
Our products are used to manage multiple types of wounds, including burns, diabetic ulcers, venous ulcers, and trauma wounds. Surgical applications include hernia repair, fistula repair, otologic repair, and soft-tissue reinforcement.
Applications for ECM technology continually evolve. Together with a global network of scientists and medical practitioners, we identify the medical needs most compatible with ECM technology and develop products to meet those needs.
