Ask the Expert
Ask the Expert: I found the perfect mobile phase for my experiments. Now how do I find the right validation standard?
Ask the Expert: What are your recommendations for keeping an SEC-MALS system clean for as long as possible? 
Ask the Expert: Is it possible to determine molar mass, size, and relative fractions of a copolymer or protein conjugate with light scattering?
Ask the Expert: I made a change to how I process my experiments. Is there a way to easily apply this change to my existing experiments?
Ask the Expert: How do I create a temperature ramp study for my DynaPro Plate Reader in DYNAMICS? 
Ask the Expert: I plan to run my samples over the weekend. How can I have the instruments shutdown after the run completes if I’m not there?
Ask the Expert: I recently added Wyatt’s HPLC Service software. How do I convert my existing methods to HPLC Control in ASTRA?
Ask the Expert: I’m using a new solvent for my SEC-MALS runs. How do I add this solvent information to ASTRA?

						While SEC-MALS with a DAWN or miniDAWN is the primary means of characterizing soluble protein aggregates, FFF-MALS, CG-MALS and DLS are valuable orthogonal techniques to meet FDA requirements. 

						SEC or FFF plus triple detection UV-MALS-RI and ASTRA software determine the molar mass of protein and modifier in conjugated biotherapeutics such as antibody-drug conjugates or PEGylated proteins. 
in situ
 in standard microwell plates, detecting aggregation as well as conformational and colloidal stability indicators. 

						CG-MALS combines a Calypso II and DAWN or miniDAWN to characterize the affinity and absolute molecular stoichiometry of drug-target binding, without labeling or immobilization. It also analyzes self-association at low, moderate and high concentrations.

Identification

					A DAWN or miniDAWN MALS detector, combined with a Wyatt SEC column and the Optilab T-rEX dRI detector, determine absolute molar masses and sizes of peptides, proteins and other biomacromolecules 
independently of column calibration
.
Purification

					Validate protein purification and stability quickly and easily with a DynaPro NanoStar cuvette-based, combined dynamic light scattering & static light scattering detector, or a high-throughput DynaPro Plate Reader III.
Charge

					The Möbiuζ is the only electrophoretic light scattering detector capable of providing reliable and repeatable measurements of a protein's net charge in high-salt buffers.
Binding

					CG-MALS combines a Calypso and DAWN or miniDAWN to characterize the affinity and absolute molecular stoichiometry of simple or complex biomolecular interactions. CG-MALS requires no labeling or immobilization, addressing self-association as well as hetero-association.

Absolute Molar Mass and Size

					A DAWN MALS detector and Optilab T-rEX dRI detector work together to determine distributions of absolute molar mass and size of natural or synthetic polymers 
independently of column calibration
.
Biodegradation

					Light scattering is an excellent means for assessing the degradation of biopolymers as a result of exposure to heat, light, high or low pH, and other stimuli.
Polysaccharides

					Key ingredients in cosmetics, the paper industry and food products, polysaccharides are also critical materials in biomedical applications such as vaccines and blood coagulants. Characterize all types of polysaccharides by SEC combined with Wyatt's on-line light scattering, dRI and viscosity detectors.
Paper and Pulp

					Lignin and cellulose present some of the most challenging biopolymeric analytes due to their unique optical and morphological properties. Wyatt offers multiple solutions for meeting these challenges.

Absolute Molar Mass and Size

					A DAWN MALS detector and Optilab T-rEX dRI detector work together to determine distributions of absolute molar mass and size of natural or synthetic polymers 
independently of column calibration
.
Branching and Conformation

					Incorporate a WyattQELS DLS module and/or a ViscoStar II differential viscometer to characterize the branching ratio and conformation of complex polymers.
Field-Flow Fractionation

					The Eclipse DualTec provides true hydrodynamic fractionation without the stress, surface interactions and non-ideal separation present in SEC. Integrates perfectly with Wyatt MALS, dRI, DLS and viscometry detectors.
dn/dc
 and
dn/dc
 and Zimm analyses for natural and synthetic polymers.

Accurate Size Distributions

					Accurate size distributions with true ensemble representation require fractionation + independent, on-line determination of size. A DAWN HELEOS II / Eclipse FFF-MALS system can characterize simple or complex fluids incorporating macromolecules with large and small nanoparticles. 
Conformation and Composition

					Information about nanoparticle shape and structure can be obtained by combining MALS analysis with dynamic light scattering. The WyattQELS DLS module integrates into the DAWN or miniDAWN for simultaneous MALS and DLS analysis. Add a UV, fluorescence and/or Optilab T-rEX dRI detector for compositional studies. 
High-Throughput Sizing

					Need to characterize your nanoparticles under hundreds of solvent conditions in the space of a few hours? The DynaPro Plate Reader III measures size distributions by DLS, 
in situ
 in standard 96-, 384- or 1536-well microtiter plates. A camera conveniently photographs each well to identify precipitates. 
Zeta Potential / Charge

					The Möbiuζ is the only zeta potential detector capable of hands-free, high-throughput measurements by coupling to an autosampler. It measures charge and size 
simultaneously
 to monitor aggregation or degradation caused by the applied electric field.

Careers
Wyatt Technology is the recognized leader in light scattering instrumentation and software for determining the absolute molar mass, size, charge and interactions of macromolecules and nanoparticles in solution.
Wyatt's line of multi-angle static light scattering products couple to size exclusion chromatography (SEC-MALS), field-flow fractionation (FFF-MALS), and stop-flow composition-gradient systems (CG-MALS). Our dynamic light scattering (DLS) products operate in traditional cuvette as well as on-line and automated, high-throughput modes. We also offer unique instruments for electrophoretic light scattering (MP-PALS), differential refractometry, and differential viscosity.
