Why Bird Control?
Each year businesses, government agencies and individuals spend thousands of dollars cleaning up after and repairing damage caused by pest birds. Nesting and roosting birds leave behind debris and droppings that can cause serious damage to buildings. Bird droppings are acidic and can quickly erode building materials. Along with the damage pest birds cause to buildings, their feces can carry any of 60 transmittable diseases. These diseases can be harmful to children and others with compromised immune systems. It is important to install safe and humane bird control products before pest birds are able to cause bird problems.

Choosing the Right Bird Control Product!
Making the correct choice in bird control products is essential to solving your bird problems. You need to know where the birds are landing and what they are doing. Are they nesting, roosting or just landing to look for food. It is also helpful to know what species of bird you are dealing with. Birds that land on a roof edge may be deterred using bird spikes, bird shock track systems or other physical bird control product.

Woodpecker deterrent
Perfect. The problem stopped immediately. The balloon doesn't make a thud when it blows against the house like the plastic owl will do. No more woodpecker!

Prompt refund!
Had to return the unopened gallon of paint because I realized that it was the wrong color. No hassle return - though I did have to pay return shipping.
