About Alencon Systems – Passionate About Power
At Alencon Systems, we are passionate about power. We were founded by world leading power electronics experts who wanted to apply their unique level of knowledge and experience to help alternative energy become even more cost competitive with other forms of generation.
It is our mission to help utility-scale solar operators harness more of the sun's energy and reduce the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) produced from a PV plant. Our unique, utility scale DC to DC optimizers and  central inverters  allow more energy to be harvested while driving down the overall Balance of Systems (BoS) cost of a utility scale solar installation. Our products feature the remarkable PV-IoT software platform called VIEWS that allows utility scale PV operators to achieve unprecedentedly granular monitoring and virtual reality display of a PV installation to assure all aspects of the system are running at peek efficiency. When used in combination, Alencon’s DC-DC optimizers, central inverters and plant monitoring software deliver the utility-scale PV plant topology of tomorrow today .
