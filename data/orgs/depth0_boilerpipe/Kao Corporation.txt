ATTENTION: Organizational/Unit Commanders and AKO Site Administrators:
AKO Classic will sunset 31 JAN 2019 and the full functionality of the portal will no longer be available.  All individual and organizational files to be retained must be moved to the new AKO 2.0.
After 31 JAN, user and organizational files will only be available in a read-only mode for individuals and organizations.
To support organizations, the new AKO 2.0 will release "Communities" functionality to the Army along with training videos on 15 NOV 2018. Organizations must create their own community presence on AKO 2.0.
In order to begin building your organizationâ€™s community, please assign an AKO Community POC and email that information to:  usarmy.belvoir.peo-eis.mbx.ako-communities@mail.mil
