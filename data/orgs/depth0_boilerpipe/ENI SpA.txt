Eni Award
A prize in step with the times
A prize in step with the times
The Eni Award is an international prize given to the best applied research projects
            in the fields of energy, sustainability and the environment. The world of energy is
            changing; as a word, it no longer refers solely to oil and coal, but instead is more
            complex, moving towards a sustainable energy mix in which renewables play an ever
            more central role.

Technology makes us competitive 
Technology makes us competitive 
By investing in new solutions we can increase the efficiency and sustainability of
                  our operations, reducing both costs and environmental impact. This is a real commitment
                  that we express in every area of our business: from the exploration of new deposits
                  to the subsequent stages of production, transport and refining, with a particular
                  focus on the strategic areas of renewables and the environment.

Research propels us into the future
Research propels us into the future
In our laboratories we develop new technologies, such as waste-to-fuel; new ideas,
                  such as the bio-refinery at Porto Marghera; and collaborative ventures, such as our
                  partnerships with MIT and the CNR or our recent agreement with the University of Bologna.

SUSTAINABILITY
Developing green businesses
We are investing in research into forms of energy that reduce emissions of gases
               that are harmful to the planet, focusing on sustainable mobility and obtaining chemicals
               from renewable sources. We are developing renewable energy projects involving concentrated
               solar power and the conversion of traditional plants into biorefineries, so we can
               produce fuels from organic raw materials.

ENERGY TRANSITION
Emission-reducing technologies
In this video, Paolo Pollesel describes Eni's Energy Transition R&D programme,
            which is developing new technologies to support the use of natural gas as an energy
            source with a reduced environmental impact as part of a circular economy. The programme
            spans three different areas: gas conversion processes; H
