Open Innovation
HRL Laboratories has received a DARPA award to significantly advance the technology and manufacturing readiness levels of its leading-edge T3 GaN technology. Integrated circuits made by layering GaN onto silicon carbide substrate wafers offer the best combination of efficiency, output power, and survivability among radio frequency and millimeter-wave semiconductor technologies.
Highest Speed GaN Electronics Racing to the Finish Line
A new program being developed by computer scientists at HRL Laboratories, LLC, is a cyber-defense system that will exploit a social engineering attacker’s methods by drawing them in with automated responses to their behavior.
Hacking Back at the Hackers
In an effort to electronically mimic neurons—the nerve cells of the brain—scientists from HRL Laboratories, LLC have successfully demonstrated novel electronic neuron circuits that exhibits as many as 23 known behaviors of biological neurons and the three classes of neuron activation (excitation) that code information between neurons about sensory events, cognitive processes, or motor actions.
Novel Memristor Neuron Circuits Offer Building Blocks  for Mimicking the Brain
HRL Laboratories, LLC, researchers have achieved a major advancement in radio frequency switches over existing technology that will vastly accelerate data streaming in smartphones and other devices on 5G wireless networks with a more reliable signal and wider bandwidth for simultaneous data streams.
New Radio Frequency Switch  Enables Faster Video and Audio 5G Streaming
In our third episode of HRL’s History of the Future Podcast we speak with Dan Sievenpiper, a whiz-kid scientist who invented the high-impedance electromagnetic surface while he was an engineering grad student at UCLA.
