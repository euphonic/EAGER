We are Inaeris Technologies – a cutting-edge biofuel technology company advancing the development of a proprietary technology platform that transforms non-food biomass into drop-in hydrocarbon transportation fuel blendstocks.  Our technology platform can provide new, alternative sources of hydrocarbon transportation fuels – sustainably – using a variety of renewable feedstocks to help promote energy security and combat global warming through reduced lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions.  Our technology is flexible and can be commercialized either as a stand-alone facility or as an addition to an existing facility, such as one that already processes biomass (a pulp/paper mill) or produces fuels (a petroleum refinery).
