Nanospectra Biosciences is a medical device company pioneering a patient-centric use of namomedicine for selective thermal ablation.
Company
Nanospectra’s proprietary ultra-focal technology platform has demonstrated its safety and efficacy in initial clinical trials and is viable for multiple applications including solid tumors, tissue and drug delivery. The company is implementing a multi-prong growth strategy including clinical advancement, exclusive partnering agreements and ongoing research and development.
Introducing the First Ultra-Focal Nanoshell Technology
Nanospectra’s proprietary AuroLase® Therapy utilizes ‘optical tunability’ for a new class of nanoparticles, called AuroShells®. These nanoshells convert light into heat and thermally destroy solid tumors without damaging adjacent healthy tissue.
AuroLase for the Ablation of Prostate Cancer Tissue
AuroLase is the first and only ultra-focal tissue ablation therapy designed to maximize treatment efficacy while minimizing side effects typically associated with surgery, radiation, and traditional focal therapies.
