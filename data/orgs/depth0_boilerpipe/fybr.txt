Fybr is recognized with Frost & Sullivan’s 2017 Product Leadership Award.
Fybr has developed a leading smart water solution for the industry that directly responds to key challenges that have traditionally stymied the growth of data-based solutions. Addressing these challenges, unlike many traditional peers in the water industry, Fybr’s platform is future-proof through its flexible and adjustable deployment that will respond to evolving customer needs, which span knowledge and management challenges across what have conventionally been disparate pieces of infrastructure. Fybr takes its partnering opportunity further by helping elevate water utilities to become a more integrated component of smart cities, involving both cross-platform data and information exchange and by leveraging its industry engagement through the Smart Cities Council.
