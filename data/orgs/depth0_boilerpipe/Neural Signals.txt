Dr. Philip R. Kennedy
MD, Ph.D
Mission Statement
The mission of Neural Signals Inc. is to provide a link to the outside world for people who are locked in their bodies - alert and intelligent but unable to communicate. This mission is embodied in our icon above.
The icon attempts to illustrate the facial profile of a person locked in a box. The opening in the box to the right shows neural signals escaping, implying that the person's thoughts can be carried out into the world on these signals, something we have already achieved.
Our emphasis is on invasive brain computer / machine interfacing, but we also are involved with non-invasive systems with our collaborators. Our aim is personal communication especially with regards to speech restoration. We are developing a Speech Prosthetic. In future we intend to apply our technology to restoration of movement, as well as eventually to enhance brain function.
Press Coverage
There are several excellent reviews of Dr. Kennedy's self implantation.
A radio broadcast summarizes very well:
US News & World Report, 2000
"A significant contribution for individuals with severely debilitating diseases, such as ALS or high-level spine injury."
National Institutes of Health, 2002
"Gives completely paralyzed people a new way to communicate."
Discover Magazine, 1999
Neural Signals Culture and Values
I should be impeccable with my word: I speak with integrity. I say only what I mean. I avoid using the word to speak against myself or to gossip about others. I use the power of the word in the direction of truth and love.
I don't take anything personally: Nothing others do is because of me. What others say and do is a projection of their own reality, their own dream. When you are immune to the opinions and actions of others you won't be the victim of needless suffering.
I don't make assumptions: I will find the courage to ask questions and to express what I really want. Communicate with others as clearly as I can to avoid misunderstandings, sadness and drama. With just this one agreement, I can completely transform my life.
I will always do my best: My best is going to change from moment to moment; it will be different when I am healthy as opposed to sick. Under any circumstances, I simply will do my best. I will avoid self-judgement, self-abuse and regret.
NSI News and Developments
NSI Timeline:
2015: Implant removed for safety. All electrodes and electronic devices were removed for his safety in January since the incision was slow to close due to the bulk of the devices. The data is being analyzed. The results were presented at the SFN meeting in 2014 and further results will be presented at SFN in 2015. Phonemes are associated with specific patterns of single unit firings, and reverse engineering is underway to reproduce the phoneme audibly.
2014:  Implant Dr. Kennedy's speech motor area On June 21 2014, four electrodes were implanted in his speech motor area located just lateral to the Sylvian fissure. In October 2014 three electronic devices were implanted to carry the signals transcutaneously to a receiver and computer for analysis.
2013: Successful Implant: We replaced ER's electronics on May 4th 2013 in Belize City, Belize. We are now recording successfully from 21 single units and using LFPs also. Our efforts are directed towards restoring speech. The specific aim on ER is to allow him to produce a few useful short words. Units are undergoing conditioning at the moment and results will be presented at the SFN meeting on Saturday afternoon, 9th November 2013. Also see www.neuralsignalsdonate.com for more details on the story of ER.
