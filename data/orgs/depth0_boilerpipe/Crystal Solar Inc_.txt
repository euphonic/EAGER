Crystal Solar has developed a breakthrough monocrystalline Silicon wafer technology  which fundamentally alters the cost-efficiency equation for photovoltaics.  This R&D 100 award winning, Direct Gas to Waferâ„¢ technology allows for high-efficiency solar panels at radically lower costs with:
50% less silicon usage compared to conventional silicon due to the kerfless nature
Demonstrated cell efficincies of > 24%
At least 10% increase in power at the module when compared to conventional mono silicon photovoltaic       technology
Less than 50% of the capital cost compared to conventional monocrystalline silicon wafer technology
The company has established  a semi-automated pilot line to demonstrate the manufacturing-worthiness and  scalability of this technology.
