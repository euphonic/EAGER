"I had the unique freedom at Skidmore to dive into a major of my own design, where
                                 I could investigate how art and marine biology inform one another. The chance to go
                                 crazy and study my exact interests was incredible."
                              
Courtney Mattison '08

"Study what excites you. Don't worry how different two areas of study appear. There's
                                 always a connection to be made or a new idea sparked. Find something that excites,
                                 and you'll use your liberal arts education."

"Even though I was an economics major, I was also able to take piano lessons each
                                 semester and play the viola in the orchestra. I recommend that you enjoy all of the
                                 diverse course offerings that Skidmore has to offer."
