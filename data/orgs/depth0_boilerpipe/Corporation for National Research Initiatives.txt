CNRI engages in prototyping and system and technology demonstration projects in order to further the design and implementation of selected infrastructure components for new computing- and communications-based applications. Current research expands upon the core components of CNRI's Digital Object Architecture; Handle.Net Registry for assigning, managing, and resolving persistent identifiers for digital objects and other Internet resources, and Cordra.org which provides a mechanism for the creation of, and access to, digital objects as discrete data structures. Other areas of interest support ongoing research in digital libraries and other networked information technologies, including the MEMS and Nanotechnology Exchange .
