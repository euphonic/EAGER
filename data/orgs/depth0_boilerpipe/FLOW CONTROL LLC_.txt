Of Ownership
The DeltaPValve® uses far less energy by increasing system stability. In fact, it has proven to reduce energy consumption in heating and cooling systems by 20 - 40%. This translates to saving millions of dollars in operating costs and eliminates needless environmental waste.
The DeltaPValve® helps achieve maximum efficiency for heating and cooling systems. By using the existing system more effectively, the building can recover lost capacity and often times defer the need for costly expansion projects.
The DeltaPValve® is industrial quality and designed to last the life of the facility and comes with an industry-leading 10-year warranty. Each DeltaPValve® is self-balancing, therefore eliminating the need for repeated system commissioning. This means the cost of maintaining system performance after installation is significantly reduced.
The DeltaPValve® tightens control within heating and cooling systems, enabling precise response and the stabilization of leaving air temperature. This improves comfort for tenants and reduces the number of hot and cold calls received by the maintenance team.
By reducing energy costs, delivering optimum system capacity, and minimizing maintenance, the DeltaPValve® simply delivers a lower total cost of ownership than any other flow control product on the market.

How it Works
Ability to Maintain ± 0.1° LAT
Leaving air temperature from the coil must be maintained within a tight tolerance in order to maintain system stability and achieve design or better ΔT.
Individually Tested and Factory Calibrated
Valves tested to ensure full shutoff and pressure independent performance within specifications.
Pressure Independent Control
Increases system stability, and thus system efficiency, by eliminating flow variation due to pressure fluctuations in the system.
Industrial Quality Design
Debris resistant design due to high spring force, large diaphragm surface area, and large passageways throughout the valve. Internal valve design is reliant on tight tolerances, dynamic spring forces and area-ratios, all playing an equally important role in valve performance and long term reliability. Stainless steel and brass internal components ensure reliability throughout a 30+ year life cycle.
Field Verifiable Performance
Inlet, intermediate, and outlet P/T ports are vital to verify pressure independent operation, validate flow rates, confirm valve shutoff, and troubleshoot system issues.
100:1 Turndown
The ability to control flow throughout the full range of the control valve. 90% of valve operation is spent below 50% open and therefore it is vital to ensure accurate control at low flow.
Full System Compatibility
Flow ranges of 0.5-5500 GPM allows precision control throughout the entire hydronic system.
