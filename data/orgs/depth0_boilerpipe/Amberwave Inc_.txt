"The majority of commercial roofs in Australia and 40% of those USA are made of thin steel sheeting that is not structurally capable of supporting the weight of conventional glass-based PV modules. We are developing a building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) roofing material to be factory integrated with low cost steel roofs for commercial buildings. This roofing product is based on the Ultra-Thin Silicon on steel (UTSi) solar cell, fabricated via epitaxial growth of a thin layer of monocrystalline silicon grown on porous silicon."
