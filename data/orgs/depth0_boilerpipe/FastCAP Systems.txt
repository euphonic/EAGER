Based on Nanoramic's proprietary compounding, dispersion and coating processes, the Nanoramic TIMs provides higher thermal conductivity than any other TIMs on the market while retaining or improving advantageous mechanical properties.
The Composite Electrode is a carbon electrode specifically designed to operate at higher voltages and temperatures. It is based on Nanoramic's proprietary 3D nanocomposite technology that provides enhancements in electrochemical stability along with very low ESR.
Nanoramic's FastCAP SD85-500 Chip Ultracapacitor is the first reflowable, slim profile, and low ESR device that fits energy storage requirements for power loss protection in SSDs.
Nanoramic's FastCAP ultracapacitors are the only hermetically sealed ultracapacitors capable of high temperature (>125°C) and low temperature (< -55°C) operation.  Nanoramic’s FastCAP ultracapacitor technology has been validated from -110°C to 250°C by Sandia National Laboratory.
Nanoramic specializes in energy storage technology and material solutions based on nano-carbons.  Nano-carbons have exceptional electrical, thermal and mechanical properties at the nano-scale level. We synthesize and incorporate nano-carbons in various materials and transfer these properties at the macroscale level.
