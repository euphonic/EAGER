DRIVING SPACE AND CPV
Solar Junction’s multi-junction solar cell technology is the engine of choice for space and terrestrial power applications.
DELIVERING RELIABILITY
Solar Junction’s proprietary technology platform maintains the lattice-matched paradigm – the foundation of reliability for solar cells and compound semiconductor devices.
COMMERCIAL EFFICIENCY
Our production solar cells have set multiple world record efficiencies.
HIGH VOLUME MANUFACTURING
LEADER IN HIGH EFFICIENCY SOLAR
CELLS FOR SPACE AND TERRESTRIAL POWER APPLICATIONS
Solar Junction Corporation was founded in 2007 to develop and commercialize the world’s highest efficiency multi-junction solar cells for the terrestrial concentrated photovoltaic (CPV) market. Since then, our products have set two world records for solar cell efficiency and we have extended our semiconductor technology platform into additional markets. Solar Junction is currently developing and manufacturing next-generation solar cells for space power applications.
FROM R&D TO PRODUCTION
Solar Junction has a complete, in-house production line at its San Jose and Sunnyvale manufacturing facilities, with capabilities ranging from research and design to production epi growth, wafer fabrication, and testing.
