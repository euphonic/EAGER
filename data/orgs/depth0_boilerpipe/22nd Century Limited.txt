Company Mission & Profile
22nd Century is a plant biotechnology company with an important mission: 
To Reduce the Harm Caused by Smoking.
Our proprietary genetic engineering technology and plant breeding expertise allow us to regulate the level of nicotine (and other nicotinic alkaloids) in the tobacco plant. As a result of our unique technology, we are able to grow tobacco with up to 97% less nicotine than conventional tobacco – as well as plants with relatively high nicotine levels. The applications for this technology are extraordinary; in independent clinical studies, our Very Low Nicotine (VLNC) cigarettes have demonstrated remarkable efficacy as a smoking cessation aid. On the other hand, for smokers who do not wish to quit, our high nicotine tobacco enables us to produce a cigarette with what we believe is the world’s lowest tar-to-nicotine ratio.
We have an extensive intellectual property portfolio of issued patents and patent applications relating to the tobacco and cannabis/hemp plants.
Goodrich Tobacco Company, LLC, 
Botanical Genetics
, 
NASCO Products, LLC
, and 
Heracles Pharmaceuticals, LLC
 are wholly-owned subsidiaries of 22nd Century Group.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration published in the 
Federal Register
 the Agency’s Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) to 
lower nicotine in cigarettes to minimally or non-addictive levels
.  With ownership or control of patents on the genes in the tobacco plant that regulate nicotine production, 
22nd Century is able to grow tobacco with up to 97% less nicotine than tobacco used in conventional cigarettes.
In 
commenting
 on the ANPRM, FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said, “This milestone places us squarely on the road toward achieving one of the 
biggest public health victories in modern history
 and saving millions of lives in the process.”
