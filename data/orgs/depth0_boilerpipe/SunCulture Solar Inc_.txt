Renewable Energy Storage. Why now?
Battery storage allows consumers to store solar energy for use 24/7, plus ensuring you are never without power. And best of all, take complete control of your energy usage.
” A next-generation smart grid without energy storage is like a computer without a hard drive: severely limited.”
-Katie Fehrenbacher, GigaOm
