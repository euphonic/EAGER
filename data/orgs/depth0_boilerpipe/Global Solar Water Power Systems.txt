                    GSWPS     
Global Solar Water Power Systems (GSWPS) designs and manufactures a wide array of          cost-effective, environmentally sensitive and sustainable solutions to          challenging problems.  They provide water and energy, shelter and comfort, and          even communications capabilities in areas with little or no operating          infrastructure.
These systems are also perfect for natural disasters: fires, floods,          earthquakes, or war torn areas where infrastructure has been destroyed.
Using solar power, wind power, waste to energy, bio-fuel and other renewable          energy sources our solutions provide independence of electrical or water grids,          creating an immediate solution to energy and clean drinking water needs in areas          where there is little or no operating infrastructure. 
Providing critical          functions, they change          polluted water to safe, clean drinking water.  They provide electricity to          the most remote areas.  GSWPS also          offers a unique energy control system that provides significant savings for          business and government clients, at little or no cost to the client.
