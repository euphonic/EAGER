Every Story Matters
“I went home feeling empowered and validated, realizing that asking for help is worth it. Most importantly, I left knowing that although my battle with mental health was not over, I had an endless army of fighters standing with me.”
Read Julia's Story
“My team, we get a lot of referrals from our crisis team and inpatient unit so the trend that we deal with is the trend of suicide and how prominent it is in the community. We work closely with families and schools to focus on safety and prevent hospitalizations. All of the small successes along the way are what keep me motivated.”
Learn More About Behavioral Health
“I’ve been in the mental health field coming up on 15 years and I’ve worked with a variety of patient populations but I think there’s something special about working with kids. They’re at a pivotal and vulnerable point in their life where you can really make a huge impact.”
