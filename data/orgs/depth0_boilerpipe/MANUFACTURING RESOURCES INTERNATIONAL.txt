Placing manufacturing professionals in direct hire jobs throughout the country.
Presented in partnership with CareerBuilder, Inavero’s Best of Staffing Talent winners have proven to be industry leaders in service quality based entirely on ratings provided by the permanent and temporary employees they’ve helped find jobs. On average, job seekers who work with winning agencies are 1.7 times more likely to be completely satisfied with the services provided compared to those placed by non-winning agencies. Less than 2% of all staffing agencies in the U.S. and Canada have earned the Best of Staffing Award for service excellence.

ResourceMFG is proud to announce we are among the first to achieve the Safety Standard of Excellence mark from American Staffing Association and National Safety Council. This accomplishment not only shows that we care about the safety of our temporary employees, but also that we adhere to industry best practices and are committed to continuous improvement.
