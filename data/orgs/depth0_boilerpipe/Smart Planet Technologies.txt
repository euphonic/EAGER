Smart Planet Technologies is a materials engineering and intellectual property company focused on sustainable material advancements for the paper packaging industry.
We've changed the game.
Unlike traditional plastic-coated paper cups and other paperboard barrier packaging which ends up in our landfills due to the difficulties recyclers have processing these materials through their equipment, packaging made with EarthCoating® uses 51% less plastic and is engineered to be easily pulped into recycled paper using conventional paper recycling equipment.

Did you know?
Paper cups, food trays, folding cartons, take-out boxes, ice cream containers, food wraps and lots of other plastic-coated paperboard packaging materials are sent to the landfill.
The first step to getting paper cups and other paperboard barrier packaging recycled is to make them valuable and easy for recyclers to process through their conventional paper recycling equipment.

EarthCoating® addresses three important pillars of sustainable packaging:
Environment
EarthCoating® may be used to create paperboard barrier packaging that can be easily pulped into recycled paper 
EarthCoating® offers significant economic savings compared to PLA and other bio-resin based alternatives
The graphic to the left illustrates the process of paper recycling. A major part of the process includes extracting and cleaning fibers from non-paper contaminants that can found in the recycled paper stream. Unlike traditional plastic coatings, EarthCoating® is engineered for efficient processing in recycling systems. EarthCoating® is designed to fracture into small, dense particles in the pulping process, thereby avoiding the challenges found with traditional plastic coatings.
We’ve recently added additional content to our repulpability report and will continue to update our data as new information becomes available.
