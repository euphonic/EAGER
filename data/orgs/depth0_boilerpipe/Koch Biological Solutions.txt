Our team is focused on developing science-based, live microbial and biologically-derived chemistries that improve plant performance at every stage of growth.
Through various modes of action, our biological solutions, developed using the proprietary Mendel Technology Platform, perform directly on the plant or its environment. As a result, both crop efficiency and nutrient uptake are improved, resulting in greater yield potential.
