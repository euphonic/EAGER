Applications
EV and Propulsion
EV and Propulsion
Higher specific energy and energy density than any lithium-ion cell available today
Higher gravimetric and volumetric energy means longer driving distances on a single charge
Cell design easily incorporated into EV battery packs
Manufacturing process leverages existing equipment
UAV, UGV, and UMV
UAV, UGV, and UMV
Cell-level specific energy of up to 650 Wh/kg enables longer operations and more air/ground/sea covered for high altitude applications
Meets market cycle life requirements*
Reduced battery weight allows for less energy consumption; greater payloads
Battery pack design ideally suited for mid-to-large UVS applications
*Cycle life dependent on application and DOD.
