Advanced Materials Research at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS).
The Department of Energy’s (DOE)  Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL)  is a significant asset to our country, through its scientific leadership and its economic impact not only on Long Island, but throughout all of New York state and the Northeast. Brookhaven National Laboratory is managed on behalf of DOE by Brookhaven Science Associates (BSA), a partnership between  Stony Brook University  and  Battelle . BSA also engages six of the world’s premier research universities (Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton and Yale) in the governance and oversight of the Laboratory. The combined strengths of these entities make significant contributions to BNL.
