Get Funding for a Solar Pumping System!
Sustainable Technologies is looking for Farmers that have operating Diesel AG Pumps that want to convert to Solar Electric pumps.  The Diesel AG pumps need to be registered with the Air District or be under 50HP to qualify.  The 65% of the conversion costs can be funded by the Air District’s Carl Moyers program.
