Look forward...
Look forward to living in homes that nurture and continually re-energize us…to sleeping soundly in darkened rooms and waking refreshed as we gradually greet the sun…to working in inspiring offices where we can gaze out the window, fuel our imaginations, and be our most creative…to windows that keep us connected to the outside world. All day long. This is the future that is upon us right now. This is Halio smart-tinting glass.
We're a different kind of start-up.
"I sit right by a Halio window, so I know from experience how cool it is, so it’s very exciting to be part of the company that created it. I also love working with so many bright minds." - Natalie
