The future of semiconductors will be dominated by More-than-Moore architectural and material innovations. Atomera has created a patented, engineered material called MST® which delivers those advancements today.
By combining a materials breakthrough with other patented techniques Atomera enables more efficient and better controlled current flow, leading to dramatic improvements in device performance and power efficiency.
Atomera engineers breathe new life into semiconductor fabs
MST squeezes a half to a full node of benefits out of legacy fabs and next-generation FinFETs. With an MST® license, manufacturers can address their nanoscale-geometry yield, power and performance challenges at a fraction of the cost of alternative approaches.
