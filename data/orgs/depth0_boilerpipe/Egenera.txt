What Our Customers Say
FitPro
FitPro has realized a cumulative 30% savings year-over-year by using Xterity for cloud services rather than continuing to add, refresh and maintain our internal servers exclusively.
John Nelson
Senior Vice President Operations and Chief Compliance and Security Officer
ScerIS
“Leveraging the Egenera Xterity Cloud allows ScerIS to focus on our core business mission of providing outstanding services and solutions to our clients.  We are helped in that mission by a team of dedicated Egenera professionals with the same customer service passion making it easy to expand services without any worry or sleepless nights.”
Ben Solomon
Managing Director
Octavian
We looked closely at both Azure and Xterity and decided to base our cloud offering on Xterity after considering both ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ factors. First, its drag and drop interface makes it extremely easy to use and we found its performance to be top-notch. We also liked the fact that we could get wholesale, predictable pricing and billing and there was no barrier to entry.
Andrew Worthington
iTG Technologies Limited
“I cannot praise the quality of Egenera’s pre- and post sales enough. No problem is too small and there is a genuine feeling that the team is always listening to customer feedback and evolving.  I’ve been in this industry for over 25 years and I know the difference between bad, good and truly excellent support and Egenera’s technical support team is firmly excellent."
Jose Noriega
President and CEO
Gradient Data Solutions
Xterity offered us the cloud services we were looking for with higher margins, a simple to use portal that allowed us to make configuration changes with a few clicks, and a better partnering experience than the bigger players.
Ben Soloman
Managing Director
Octavian
The one thing that completely set Xterity apart from the competition was its partner experience. We get fantastic pre- and post-sales support along with an extremely high level of technical support from experienced cloud engineers that are readily available to us at no extra cost. We would never get that level of support from any of the big players.
Oisin Curran
Odyssey Validation Consultants
Egenera’s pay as you go model, worldwide footprint and worldwide 24/7/365 support made Xterity the obvious choice for us to base our new GxP offering on.
