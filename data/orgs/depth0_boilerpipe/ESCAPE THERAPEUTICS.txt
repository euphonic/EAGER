Since its founding in 2006, Escape Therapeutics has dedicated itself to transforming healthcare through discovery,      development, and commercialization of innovative stem cell-based curative therapeutics capable of relieving the      suffering of children and adults inflicted with devastating diseases or injuries that are currently inadequately      treated and/or incurable.
Headquartered in Silicon Valley, California, the company has built an elite team of Stanford-trained scientists      with core expertise in stem cell immunology and genetic engineering. This has fueled a series of significant      scientific advances over the past 4 years, bringing Escape only months away from the creation of the world's      first universal pluripotent stem cell source. Escape's primary areas of focus include type I diabetes, acute      myocardial infarction, and acute and chronic skin wounds.
