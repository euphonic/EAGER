Based on estimates of what customers who enrolled with Sunrun between January 2016 and April 2018 would have paid for energy over 20 years versus estimates of what they may pay with Sunrun over 20 years. Analysis assumes consistent energy usage, annual utility rate increases of 3.76%, and full utilization of the 30% solar Investment Tax Credit by the system owner. Savings are not guaranteed and will vary based on various factors, including Sunrun product type, actual energy usage, actual system production, geography, weather, shade, and actual utility rate structures and rate increases.
