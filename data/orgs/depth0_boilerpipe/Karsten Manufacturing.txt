Made To Order: Building Bubba’s Driver
1959
At home one evening, Karsten Solheim putts with his first prototype putter head, and the tuning-fork-like construction makes a ‘ping’ sound when impacting the ball. Karsten excitedly runs into the kitchen and announces to his wife, Louise, “I’ve got a name for my putter!” Soon thereafter, he files for a patent on the PING 1-A putter. Three years later, the patent is granted.
