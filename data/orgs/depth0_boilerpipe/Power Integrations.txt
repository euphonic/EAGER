Power Integrations today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2018. Net revenues for the third quarter were $110.1 million, an increase of one percent from the prior quarter and a decrease of one percent from the third quarter of 2017. Net income for the quarter was $17.7 million or $0.59 per diluted share, compared to net income of $0.51 per diluted share in the prior quarter and $0.54 per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017. Cash flow from operations was $23.2 million for the quarter.
Power Integrations just announced a new member of the LinkSwitch-XT2 offline switcher ICs incorporating 900 V primary MOSFETs. Targeting high-efficiency isolated and non-isolated flyback power supplies up to 8 W, the up-rated ICs are suitable for three-phase industrial power supplies to 480 VAC and high-quality consumer products destined for regions with unstable mains grids, tropical regions with frequent lightning strikes or any area where high-energy ring-waves and surges are prevalent.
