Converting agricultural waste into high value natural soil amendment products.
INTEGRATED BIOMASS PLATFORM
Results Based on Science & Technology
Ag Energy utilizes time-proven gasification technologies with modern, automated control systems to convert agricultural waste into a valuable carbonous material and syngas.
Ag Energy’s fully automated and movable gasifier can process many dry, homogenous, cellulosic biomasses. The carbonous material produced, has a high commercial and industrial value as a key component in soil remediation efforts and as a filtration media. The addition of this material into agricultural soils provides significant yield improvements, reduces water usage and is an economical means for sequestering carbon. The syngas can be used as a fuel to produce heating and cooling, electricity, or can be filtered to get pure hydrogen.
Ag Energy’s fully automated and portable IBP can process any dry, homogenous, cellulosic biomass.
Syngas is a blend of combustible gases – hydrogen and carbon monoxide – that can be used as a fuel or further refined to create pure hydrogen.
Biochar is the carbon byproduct of biomass gasification. Ag Energy biochar is a high-quality activated charcoal which has been shown to yield significant benefits to crops in both laboratory and field tests.
