Real-time Drainage Analysis (RDA) provides a patent pending mechanism to compute and analyze assymetrical drainage in every well, providing the knowledge needed to fully exploit an unconventional field without compromising the benefits of standardized  drilling and stimulation operations.
Production potential model constructed using well, stimulation plan, modeled fractures and discrete fracture network.
Expected  drainage from type curve and PPM  over life of well.
The primary objectives of NarSysTech are to provide our clients with higher and more consistent production from every well through the  early identification of by-passed pay and prediction of pressure anamolies that are caused by assymetrical drainage. More....
