ECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL ADVANTAGES THAT BUILD ON THE SUCCESS OF BIOETHANOL
Economic and environmental advantages that build on the success of bioethanol
Patented technology enables cost-effective commercialization of a new biofuel molecule
COMPATIBLE WITH today’s cars and fuel infrastructure
Working together to introduce bio-isobutanol to the market and meet refiner demand
Not only in transportation fuels and biotechnology, but across the entire biofuel value chain
The Bio-Isobutanol Advantage
Bio-ISObutanol has a number of significant advantages over existing ​biofuels:
Highest value biofuel which can be produced at existing ethanol production facilities enabling rapid scale-up of total product volumes
Can be blended into gasoline at higher concentrations, providing twice the renewable content in every gallon (U.S. regulations allow bio-isobutanol to be blended at 16% by volume vs. 10% by volume for ethanol)
Drop-in biofuel—can be used in existing vehicles and infrastructure
Improved refining economics—allows refiners to increase gasoline yield at lower cost
Does not separate in water, enabling bio-isobutanol to be  blended directly at refineries and transported via existing fuel infrastructure and pipelines
Butamax Technology
Butamax® Advanced Biofuels, a joint venture of BP and DuPont, has developed an innovative bio-isobutanol production technology offering a low-cost, high-value drop-in biofuel for global transportation fuels supply. Butamax technology is designed to convert the sugars from various biomass feedstocks, including corn and sugarcane, into bio-isobutanol using existing biofuel production facilities.
Butamax and Highwater Ethanol have broken ground on the company’s first bio-isobutanol retrofit project. Butamax’s cutting-edge technology package implements novel corn oil separation technology. This technology is part of a Butamax licensing opportunity, which is an integral part of the full retrofit to bio-isobutanol production and can be installed independently as a first phase of conversion.
