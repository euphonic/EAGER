Bio-Screw | Feedscrews for Bioplastics
GLYCON CORP. (founded in 1978 as Great Lakes Feedscrews) has been successfully designing and manufacturing 
feedscrews for plastics processing machinery for over 40 years.
With the rapid growth of the focus on the environment, 
BIOPLASTIC TECHNOLOGY
 has become a critical component of 
the future of the plastics industry. Glycon has recently re-designed their screw design laboratory, now designated as the 
"INNOVATION LAB"
, to facilitate testing of the processability and performance of new environmentally friendly 
polymers. The objective of the Innovation Lab is to run and compare different materials, i.e. Biobased vs. Petroleum 
based as well as Biodegradable, Recycled and Compostable materials. Lab technicians will choose from over 25 different 
screw configurations with the ability to modify and re-cut onsite to achieve optimum performance.
