Smart Reflective Technology™
Mobile data growth and the vast number of connected mobile devices are overwhelming today’s cellular networks. Add to that emerging technologies like 5G networks, autonomous vehicles, IoT and smart cities that demand the higher number of low-power access nodes in Ultra Dense Networks, and it becomes obvious that NPI has the answer – our patented Smart Reflective Technology™ that allows for continuous wireless access along any paved surface in the world.
Cellular connectivity can be too costly
The need to offload mobile data traffic to free more bandwidth from today’s cellular network is evident. Carriers even have mobile devices programmed to automatically shift mobile data to a wireless connection, if present, to decrease demand on the cellular network. And users have to consider the extra expense they can incur by exceeding data limits.
Smart Reflective Architecture for
Seamless Wireless & Ultra Dense Networks
NPI’s Smart Reflective Architecture allows for a seamless mobile data infrastructure, enabling carriers to have the capability to enhance the mobile user experience with better connectivity, higher throughput, and access to a broadened customer base.
With technology advancing in 5G networks, IoT, autonomous vehicles, smart cities and more, Ultra Dense Networks are increasingly required. NPI provides the ideal solutions in devices and design to build that infrastructure reliably and affordably.
