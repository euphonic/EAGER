Testimonials
I just want to tell you, I love the litter. Fritz has not peed outside of the box since.  He is now a house cat, and I am glad to have this litter.  I would buy your litter all the time, for sure. –T.J., Cat Owner Product Testing
EcoSponge is a strong product – allowing drying of product, while reducing salts and HC, even before adding bacteria – can take waste to on-site disposal in 90 days (before the pad is released for production).  The Confluence Energy Team is extremely organized.  — Scott, Drilling Supervisor, Oil & Gas Industry
Besides selling it, we use EcoPett Crumble in-store for our chicks’ bedding. We used to see 16 times the loss in chicks than what we are getting now that we switched to EcoPett Crumble.  When we used straw or shavings, the resulting infections from the chick waste was troubling, and we were cleaning the coops at least 3 times a week.  With EcoPett, we only lose 1%  (as opposed to 17%) and only have to clean once a week.

EcoSponge is the best product – light but effective. — Kent, Drilling Supervisor, Oil & Gas Industry

In every catastrophe, there’s an opportunity.” That’s when he began the process of raising the capital and building a wood pellet mill. And, he never looked back. continue…
