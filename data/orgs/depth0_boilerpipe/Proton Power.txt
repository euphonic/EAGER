Our goal is to
make clean energy cost-competitive 
with fossil fuels
and more accessible to people 
who need it.
Proton Power, Inc.
Proton Power, Inc. (PPI) has developed a proprietary, patent-protected, clean energy system for the cost-effective conversion of a wide variety of biomass feedstocks into 
synthetic fuel
 or 
electricity
.  In addition, PPI systems produce a high quality, semi-activated carbon 
biochar
 product with valuable agricultural and industrial applications.  And, an exciting recent development is the ability to produce 
graphene
 in significant quantities.  PPI systems are financially viable at a relatively small scale, making them easy to locate close to feedstock supply.  The process saves businesses on capital and production costs and promises a greener tomorrow.  Very simply, PPI is able to provide safe, viable, sustainable energy solutions that make business sense.
