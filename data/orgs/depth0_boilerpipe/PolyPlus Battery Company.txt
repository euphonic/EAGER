until now.
The next breakthrough in battery innovation is here…
Our proprietary Glass Protected Li Metal Batteries feature a solid-state lithium anode laminate that doubles the energy density of current rechargeable batteries. Our advantage lies in the ability to integrate the novel anode into existing battery technology.

Market Applications
The demand for smaller, lighter batteries is large and growing rapidly. Flight times for drones are limited by battery weight, robotic applications are negatively impacted by both the weight and size of the battery, and designers of consumer electronics have a difficult choice between runtime and device features imposed by the limited energy density of present day Li-ion cells. These limitations are addressed by the step-change technology of PolyPlus’ glass protected Li metal battery.
