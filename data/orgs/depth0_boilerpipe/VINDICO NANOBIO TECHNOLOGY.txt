Welcome to Vindicoat
Vindicoat is a team of experts whose focus is to license and commercialize a chemical surface treatment which enables nano molecular bonding between metals (Aluminum, Titanium, and Stainless Steel) and epoxy. The resulting treated metal yields a 5x adhesion increase, is corrosion proof and eliminates the need for costly surface abrasion. Metal to Polymer shearing, corrosion, and abrasion are all costly multi-industry, multinational problems which Vindicoat solves with conversion coating technology.
Why Vindicoat
Eliminates Abrasion +
Easily Sourced Chemicals +
Depending on the scale of economy, the cost in chemicals will range from $0.05 - $0.10 per square inch.
Reduces Delamination +
Vindicoat’s process improves the binding between metal surfaces and composite materials to reduce delimitation, the separation of the resin/fiber composite from the metal support. It is a unique method of “pre-treating” metal surfaces to enhance the bonding performance of adhesives, paints and other coatings. Think of it as the perfect primer.

About
Industries
Vindicoat, LLC was formed in Alvin, Texas, in October 2014. The company’s Intellectual Property (IP) process is based on a chemical surface treatment which enables nano molecular bonding between metals and epoxy. Vindicoat owns the domestic IP on the Surface Treatment process and seeks to license this technology to the key industries known for early adoption. Aerospace composites and fastening markets have proved especially receptive to technical solutions we provide.
