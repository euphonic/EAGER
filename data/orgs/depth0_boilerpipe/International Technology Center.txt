The International Technology Center (ITC) is a 501(c)(3)                            non-profit research corporation established                            to foster economic development through innovation in                            advanced microfabrication technologies. Through grants                            from federal government agencies and industrial sponsors,                            ITC seeks to pursue applied research programs in cooperation                            with local, state, national and international partners.                            By relying on a network of partners, ITC has access                            to a broad range of materials and process technologies                            that enable the microfabrication of a range of novel                            devices, as well as computational modeling from basic                            materials science to advanced integrated circuits.
