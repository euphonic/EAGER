Patients and Their Families
Since its founding, Alexion has given hope to people who had none and shined a light on those who felt isolated and alone.
But we know that fighting rare diseases takes so much more than hope.
It requires persistence, dedication, and a relentless pursuit of the highest levels of medical innovation.
Pursuing Groundbreaking Innovation
Through the transformative power of our science, we have delivered life-changing therapies to patients suffering from rare diseases—diseases that often affect families for generations. We have pioneered the complex field of complement biology and delivered solutions to challenges that once seemed impossible for patients with devastating complement-mediated and metabolic disorders.
Creating a Lasting Impact
The dedication and passion of our employees enable us to achieve our mission. We are building a rewarding place to work where people are empowered to make a difference and where diversity of backgrounds and ideas is encouraged.
Serving Patients Today and the Generations That Follow
Patients with rare diseases are our guiding star. They inspire us every day to find answers, and we act with integrity, urgency, and discipline because we know their lives are at stake.
