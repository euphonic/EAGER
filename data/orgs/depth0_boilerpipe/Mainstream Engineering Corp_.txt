Welcome to Mainstream Engineering Corporation
Mainstream is a premier R&D company that focuses on transitioning advanced thermal control and energy conversion technology into high-quality and cost-effective commercial products. Areas of expertise include heat transfer, fluids, thermodynamics, mechanics, chemistry, nano-technology, and power. Mainstream is currently providing solutions to NASA, DOD, DOE, DOT, DOC, USDA, and industry through externally-funded R&D programs. Mainstream also has extensive internally-funded R&D to support our externally-funded R&D and to transition R&D into commercial products.
Mainstream has a long tradition of actively supporting the local community, for example Mainstream personnel serve in the local chapters of professional organizations including ASME, SAE, AIChE, ASHRAE; Mainstreamâ€™s scientists and engineers support the local university (Florida Institute of Technology) both as adjunct professors, board members and with joint research efforts. Mainstream has a demonstrated 29 year track-record of focusing on the total system solution and Mainstream holds more than 100 patents directly in this area.
