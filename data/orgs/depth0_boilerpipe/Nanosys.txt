Typical power use of mobile devices.
Beautiful design and lasting power
Our technology also makes displays brighter without draining power. Think about your phone. The display alone uses 45% of the power. This means more charging and less time doing the things you love like talking, texting, using apps and browsing. Wouldn’t it be nice if your battery lasted much longer? Quantum dots reduce the power consumption of displays by more than 20%. This means better devices with improved battery life without sacrificing the beautiful design we love-- creating thinner, longer lasting devices with brilliantly colorful devices.
Quantum Dot Pioneers
Setting the new standard in color displays
Nanosys is leading the development of quantum dot technology for displays.
Since our founding in 2001, we have partnered with leading display makers in creating standout  tablets, TVs and smartphones that are thinner, lighter, brighter and more colorful than ever before. While most of the innovative work we do can be measured in atomic units, the true impact of our technology advancements reach far beyond the beautiful and vibrant devices consumers hold in their hands.
