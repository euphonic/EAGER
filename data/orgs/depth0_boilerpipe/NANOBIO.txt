 mucosal adjuvant

shown to be safe and effective in human clinical studies.
Most infectious pathogens enter the body across mucosal surfaces. Yet few vaccines today provide mucosal immunity. BlueWillow’s vaccines are different.
Our unique and patented adjuvant technology enables intranasal vaccines that elicit antibodies in the blood as well as across mucosal surfaces. These mucosal antibodies serve as “Bouncers at the Door” to keep infections out.  Our studies point to increased protection against some of the world’s most severe respiratory and sexually transmitted diseases.
