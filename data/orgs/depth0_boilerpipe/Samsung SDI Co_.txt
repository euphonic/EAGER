Samsung SDI targeting EU market with new residential ESS m..
  Samsung SDI revealed its differentiated technology through new ‘high-voltage home ESS battery module’ with high energy conversion efficiency.  Samsung SDI participated in 'EES (Electrical Energy Storage) Europe 2018’ - the world’s biggest exhibition for the ESS - held in Munich Germany for three days from Jun 20, showing its slogan ‘Powering Tomorrow’ refers to ‘Samsung SDI’s will to contribute to the future of the energy industry’ and exhibiting a range of ESS products. This year, Samsung SDI attracted attention with its ‘high-voltage residential ESS battery module’ that features superior energy conversion efficiency by high voltage compared to the conventional residential ESS modules. To use the power generated by the photovoltaic generator at home, a current conversion process is required, which causes power loss.  In this process, the higher the voltage of the ESS holds, the lower the energy loss occurs, which leads to higher efficiency.   Samsung SDI’s 'high-voltage residential ESS module' has been evaluated to have evolved by twice the energy density compared to the products released last year. It is the cell & module design technology that enables a significant increase in energy density just in a year. Without changing the size of battery cell applied to the 'high-voltage residential ESS module,' Samsung SDI enlarged its capacity by more than 20% through innovation of internal materials and optimized the module design to double the energy density.  The residential ESS market is growing steadily, centering on the European market, where solar and other renewable energy supply is high. Market research agency B3 forecasts that the residential ESS market will be 1,259MWh (megawatt hours) this year and 1,889MWh in 2020, growing at an average annual rate of 15%. Executive Vice President Kim Jeong-wook representing Samsung SDI Strategic Marketing Office said, "Samsung SDI has been attracting global customers by introducing innovative ESS battery products each year. We will solidify our position as a leading ESS battery company through differentiated technology."  [Global Residential ESS Market] ※ Projection by B3​

The exhibition covers three themes - “Extend Your Journey,” “Redefine Your Design” and “Enjoy Your Ride.” Samsung SDI is capable of unparalleled product competitiveness with a lineup of various battery cells for electric vehicles (EVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) which come in 37, 50, 60 and 94 ampere hour capacities. The lineup is highlighted by battery cells with energy densities high enough to propel EVs as far as 600 kilometers after just a 20-minute charge. Also Exhibited will be modules and packs utilizing these innovative battery cells demonstrating Samsung SDI’s capabilities as total solution provider. In addition SDI will highlight the recently introduced battery technology of “graphene balls,” a unique material that enables a 45 percent increase in capacity and five times faster charging speed. SDI will also be showing their latest effort with “solid-state batteries,” a technology which has improved both the capacity and safety of SDI’s batteries. The development of “graphene balls” by a team of researchers at the Samsung Advanced Institute and Technology was covered in the November 2017 edition of the science journal Nature Communications. Samsung SDI also showcased various battery products, which will draw interest from automakers that want EV batteries tailored to their specific needs.     Multi-Functional Module Battery Packs of Samsung SDI allow users to adjust the number of modules to capacities they need and thus to diversify driving distances capabilities. These packs are expected to catch the eyes of automakers that want to make vehicles with different ranges by using a single pack as the foundation for an entire vehicle platform.  Another groundbreaking Samsung SDI product exhibited at the show is the “Low Height Cell.” This is a cell whose height has been reduced by more than 20 percent from existing cells. By using this cell design the automotive companies can increase the interior space of an EV and increase design flexibility for the vehicle overall.  Samsung SDI also displayed cells and modules based on the new 21700 standard cylindrical battery. A ‘21700’ battery is 21 millimeters in diameter and 70 millimeters in height with capacity that is 50 percent larger than 18650 battery technology. Its size is optimal for maximizing power output as well as battery life. A 21700 battery has come into the spotlight as the next-generation standard for applications in Energy Storage Systems (ESS), electric power tools and electric vehicles. “We will lead the popularization of electric vehicles by developing products based on cutting-edge technology which will in an optimum manner meet the needs of our customers and the market,” Jeong Seh-woong, executive vice president of automotive business and ESS business of Samsung SDI, said. “We will continue to lead global market as the world’s top technology company providing total solutions for EV battery applications.”
