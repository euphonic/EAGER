OUR 
VISION
Inventing Simple® isn’t just a slogan to us, it’s a way of life. 
Using simple plug-and-play ideology, we revolutionized 
solar installations in 2003 with our Interconnect System™. 
Our harnessing system is now the gold standard EPC’s use 
around the world. By using simple ideas, we are making solar 
energy a more affordable and clean power source for future 
generations.
Through innovation and diversification our company has 
grown exponentially since its founding in 1996. We maintain 
a diverse portfolio of PV balance of systems (“BOS”) 
products, including custom harness solutions, combiner/
re-combiner boxes, junction boxes, PV wire, in-line fuses, 
racking and string level monitoring solutions. Our team 
expects and maintains the highest standards for excellence. 
It is this standard, and a pursuit for innovation, that drives 
Shoals to invent simple. 
With solutions second to none in the marketplace, we are 
privileged to have our products installed in some of the 
largest solar fields around the world.
