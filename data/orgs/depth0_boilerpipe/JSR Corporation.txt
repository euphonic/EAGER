News & Announcements
Governor Northam Announces Collaborative Effort to Transform VCCS
At an event held at Reynolds Downtown Campus, Governor Ralph Northam announced a collaborative effort to transform workforce programs offered through the Virginia Community College System (VCCS). Currently, many programs intended to train students with applied skills require them to take general education courses before advancing to essential skills-based courses. To best prepare students with the skills needed for high-demand, well-paying jobs, VCCS will work to redesign career pathways so that skills training begins at the start of each program.
I'm Living My Dream
Reynolds Culinary Arts Alum
Denton Taylor’s enthusiasm pops like oil in a hot skillet. He has won his culinary lottery: a cooking position in the world-renowned Momofuku restaurant in Washington DC. As Denton talks about his work, his voice is full of boundless energy and open joy, byproducts of his achievement. That’s what happens when you go for your dreams - and you get them.
Dana Newcomer
CCWA Apprenticeship Coordinator
She wore a tiny glittered black hat and a pair of stockings that appeared to have survived a zombie attack. A spider web crossed her desk. It was Halloween and CCWA Apprenticeship Coordinator Dana Newcomer was in the spirit.
