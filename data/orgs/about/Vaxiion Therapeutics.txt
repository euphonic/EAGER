Vaxiion was spun-out from San Diego State University's Department of Biology
​​​​​​Vaxiion Therapeutics was founded by Professor Emeritus Dr. Roger Sabbadini  and his graduate student Neil Berkley  at San Diego State University in 2000 and is  one of several biotechnology companies to emerge from San Diego State University's Department of Biology. 
​​​​Since its inception, Vaxiion has led several rounds of finance, each led by Western States Investment Group, a regional private equity firm with over $100M under management. 
​The company operates out of its San Diego offices in close connection with a team of specialized industry consultants and Key Opinion Leaders on the clinical front as we finalize our IND for our lead product and prepare for clinical development.
