By entering any such sweepstakes, contest or other promotion, you agree to comply with abide by such rules and the decisions of the sponsor(s) identified therein, which shall be final and binding in all respects.
15. NON-RESIDENTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Salon operates the Site in the United States of America. Salon makes no representation that the Site is appropriate or available for use in locations other than the United States of America. If you access the Site from locations outside of the U.S.A. you do so on your own initiative and at your own risk, and you are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
16. REFUSAL OR DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE
You understand and agree that Salon may, in its sole discretion and at any time, for any reason, terminate your password, account or use of the Site, or prohibit you from accessing the Site, in whole or in part.

Should Salon take any of these actions, it may, in its sole discretion, immediately deactivate and/or delete any or all information about and concerning your account. Any violation of this Agreement may result in restrictions on your access to all or part of the Site and may be referred to law enforcement authorities.
17. CHOICE OF LAW AND FORUM
This Agreement, including all revisions and amendments thereto, and any disputes arising from or relating to this Agreement or your use of the Site, are governed by the laws of the State of California, without regard to any conflict or choice of law principles that would require application of the laws of another jurisdiction. The exclusive forum and venue for any action, including any small claims court action, arising from or relating to this Agreement or your use of the Site and not subject to arbitration as provided below, will be the state or federal courts located in San Francisco, California.
18. ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER
Please read this section carefully. It affects your rights.
Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to a customer’s satisfaction by contacting us at corehelp@salon.com. This Provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and Salon. Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision. You have the right to opt-out of this Provision (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.
Please read this Provision carefully. It provides that all Disputes between you and Salon shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Except as otherwise provided, entering into this agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees).
For the purpose of this Provision, the “Salon” means Salon and its parents, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Salon regarding any aspect of your relationship with Salon, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as Salon’s licensors, suppliers, dealers or third party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.
WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION.

For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give Salon an opportunity to resolve the Dispute. You must commence this process by mailing written notification to Salon Media Group, Inc., 101 Spear Street, Suite 203, San Francisco, CA 94105. That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your Claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek. If Salon does not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.
Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out
Notwithstanding the above, you or Salon may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the “Opt-Out Deadline”). You may opt out of this Provision by mailing written notification Salon Media Group, Inc., 101 Spear Street, Suite 203, San Francisco, CA 94105. Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Salon through arbitration. Your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Salon. Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court.
Arbitration Procedures
If this Provision applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or Salon may initiate arbitration proceedings. The arbitration will be conducted under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("JAMS Rules") in effect on the date of commencement of the arbitration, as modified by these TOS. The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be based entirely on the written submissions of the parties and documents submitted to the arbitrator, unless the parties agree or the arbitrator orders otherwise. Unless you and Salon both agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not join your claim(s) or Salon's claim(s) with any other claim, and may not preside over any representative or class proceedings.
Because the Service and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.
Arbitration Award – The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.
Location of Arbitration – You or Salon may initiate arbitration in either San Francisco, California or the federal judicial district that includes your billing address. In the event that you select the federal judicial district that includes your billing address, Salon may transfer the arbitration to San Francisco, California in the event that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the transfer, as determined by the arbitrator.
Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs – For any arbitration in which you claim less than $10,000, Salon will reimburse you for the cost of your filing fee with JAMS and will directly pay all of JAMS' other costs and fees. For claims between $10,000 and $75,000, you will pay any filing fee required by JAMS, and Salon will pay all of JAMS' other costs and fees. If you bring claims between $10,000 and $75,000 and the arbitrator determines that you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, Salon will pay the fee directly on your behalf. If, however, the arbitrator determines that any claim brought by you is frivolous, then payment of JAMS' costs and fees will be governed by the JAMS rules. Furthermore, if the arbitrator determines that your claims are frivolous, you agree to reimburse Salon for any costs or fees that it paid that otherwise would have been your responsibility under the JAMS Rules. If you bring a claim for greater than $75,000, payment of fees and other costs to JAMS will be governed by the JAMS Rules. In addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with Salon as provided in the section above titled “Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution” and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.
Class Action Waiver
Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and Salon specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration. If you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other user of the Service can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.
Severability
If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision, and the remainder of this Provision will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court.
Survival
This Provision shall survive the termination of your service with Salon or its affiliates. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you and Salon agree that if Salon makes any change to this Provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change and require Salon to adhere to the language in this Provision if a dispute between us arises.
19. NO WAIVER
No modification or amendment to nor waiver of any part of this Agreement shall be of any force or effect unless formally posted by Salon as part of these TOS, or made in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of Salon.
20. SEVERABILITY
If any provision of this Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable, the provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in force.
21. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
This Agreement, the Privacy Policy, and any other terms and conditions of service for specific services or features of the Site constitute the entire agreement between you and Salon and govern your use of the Site.

"#MenToo: Are guys the real victims of sexism?"
 has been further edited since its original publication. Attorney Alfred Rava's relationship with the National Coalition of Men, and we have included Rava's statement that he has held no official position with that group in recent years. A later quotation from Rava concerning the organization has been deleted.

[N]either I nor JCN has ever engaged in a strategy to end judicial appointments, nor have we promoted state judicial elections as a one-size-fits-all approach.

CNN keeps letting guests and paid commentators lie about climate scientists
It's not true that scientists do climate research to get rich, and CNN knows it
This article originally appeared on Media Matters .
CNN has let at least three commentators argue this week that scientists are warning the public about climate change because they're getting rich by doing so — a ridiculous and patently false claim . CNN knows it's ridiculous and false because the network ran a fact-checking segment debunking the claim and interviewed a climate scientist who explained why it's wrong. But even that didn't stop the network from continuing to spread the lie.
To make matters worse, the three people who made this lie on CNN — former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), former Rep. Tom DeLay (R-TX), and Trump-boosting economist Stephen Moore — have themselves been the beneficiaries of fossil fuel money, but CNN failed to disclose that information.

CNN lets liars lie
Following the release of the National Climate Assessment , a major government report about the dangers that climate change poses to the U.S., CNN contributor Santorum came on "State of the Union" on Sunday morning to discuss it. Among other idiotic things, he said :
I think the point that Donald Trump makes is true, which is — look, if there was no climate change, we'd have a lot of scientists looking for work. The reality is that a lot of these scientists are driven by the money that they receive, and of course they don't receive money from corporations and Exxon and the like. Why? Because they're not allowed to because it's tainted. But they can receive it from people who support their agenda, and that, I believe, is what's really going on here.
Santorum's comments about climate scientists doing it for the money were widely mocked on Twitter . But that didn't stop other conservative commentators from repeating the bogus claim during CNN appearances.
DeLay, who resigned as House majority leader in 2005 after being convicted of money laundering and conspiracy, made similar comments on "CNN Right Now" on Monday:
The report is nothing more than a rehash of age-old 10- to 20-year assumptions made by scientists that get paid to further the politics of global warming.
CNN does fact-checking, confirms that the lie is a lie
On Tuesday morning, CNN's John Avlon played clips of what Santorum and DeLay said and then proceeded to debunk their claims in a "Reality Check" segment:
John Avlon (political analyst): Now that talking point you're hearing is a classic bit of distraction and deflection designed to muddy the waters just enough to confuse the clear consensus. In fact, one of the scientists who worked on the climate change report, Katharine Hayhoe, confirms that she and her colleagues were paid, quote, “zero dollars” for their work and could easily make ten times their salaries by working for something like Big Oil. So it turns out that this idea that climate change scientists are rolling in the dough Scrooge McDuck-style is so pervasive that it had to have its own Yale study debunking it.
The Yale study that he referred to is a guide by the Yale Climate Communications group that lists arguments refuting the "persistent myth" that scientists are in it for the money.

CNN then hosted the climate scientist Avlon cited, Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, who laughed at the claim that she and her colleagues are paid to advance an agenda and explained why it's incorrect:
Katharine Hayhoe (atmospheric scientist): I got paid zero dollars to write this report. My salary would have been exactly the same if I had or hadn't. And if I were studying astrophysics like I used to, I'd probably get exactly the same salary as well. The reality is that I’ve found people often accuse us of doing what they would often do themselves in our position. If we just cast our eye down the richest corporations in the world on Wikipedia's list, the vast majority of those owe their wealth to fossil fuels, so therefore they have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo as long as possible.
CNN invites liar back on to repeat lie
But even after CNN debunked the lie with its own programming, the network invited Moore back on to double down and repeat the discredited claim. During "At This Hour With Kate Bolduan" on Tuesday, host Bolduan played Moore a clip of Hayhoe's comments and let him respond :
Moore: She runs the climate change center at the school in Texas. What keeps those centers alive is the climate change industry. My only point is that the government in the United States and around the world has spent billions and billions of dollars on climate change. It has become an industry. That does call into question some of the partiality of this research. But the bigger point is —
Bolduan: You still don't think she is just motivated by science?
Moore: She may be. I'm not calling out any single person. I'm just saying that the industry is very, very well funded. It’s in the billions of dollars. People have a vested financial interest in talking about armageddon and these kinds of things.

CNN invited Moore back on for yet another appearance on Tuesday, again on "Erin Burnett OutFront," in which he continued to repeat specious right-wing talking points about the National Climate Assessment.
And Santorum also got another chance to repeat the lie about climate scientists being motivated by money. During an appearance on "Anderson Cooper 360°" on Tuesday night, Santorum said :
I said this the other day and I've gotten a — I've become a very popular man on Twitter in the last couple of days for the comment I made about scientists making money. There would be no chair of the head of climate studies at every university in America if we didn’t have a crisis. These people make money because there's a crisis.
Santorum's appearance on "Anderson Cooper 360°" was all the more egregious because Cooper interviewed climate scientist Hayhoe for the episode, and even teased the interview during the show, but ultimately didn't air it. Hayhoe revealed this fact in a tweet , part of a longer thread about the experience:
CNN did end up posting the interview with Hayhoe on its website . In it, Hayhoe said:
Hayhoe: What I do take personally is when we are accused of being in it for the money. I got paid zero dollars to write this report, and honestly, I could have spent those hundreds of hours elsewhere. We don't do this for the money. We do it because we're physicians of the planet. We understand that our planet is running a fever. The impacts are serious and will become dangerous, and we have to act now, not for the good of the planet but for the good of every single human who lives on it.
Cooper: I mean, that is something the president has said in the past, that this is a hoax, and that there are people who've said on our air that this is a money-making scheme essentially, this is a money-making venture.
Hayhoe: I would ask them where are they getting their money from.
Great points from Hayhoe. Too bad they didn't make it on the air.

CNN fails to disclose that liars have received fossil fuel money
While CNN lets its commentators falsely accuse scientists of being motivated by graft, the network has failed to disclose that those very commentators have financial motivations of their own: All three have gotten money from fossil fuel interests that oppose climate action.
Santorum received $763,331 in contributions from the oil and gas industry during his time in the Senate from 1995 to 2007. His long career of shilling on behalf of fossil fuel interests paid off after he left Congress and started doing lucrative work as a consultant, including earning $142,500 in 2010 and the first half of 2011 from Consol Energy, a Pennsylvania coal and gas company. Santorum is also currently the co-chair of biofuels advocacy group Americans for Energy Security and Innovation. Anderson Cooper disclosed that Santorum is paid by the biofuels group before his discussion with Santorum, but did not note the fossil fuel money Santorum has raked in over the years.
DeLay received $739,677 in contributions from the oil and gas industry from 1985 to 2008, and gave enormous handouts to the industry during his time in office.
For his part, Moore has worked for many fossil fuel-backed advocacy groups, including the Koch-funded Cato Institute , Club for Growth , and Donors Capital Fund . He was also chief economist at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank that has been funded by ExxonMobil and the Kochs. And just last last month, Moore gave a speech at the annual meeting of the Oklahoma Oil and Gas Association.
