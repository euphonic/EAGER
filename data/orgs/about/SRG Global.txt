Our history, our strong roots
In 1932, in the depths of the Great Depression, Guardian Glass Company boldly opened operations in Detroit, Michigan as a small automotive windshield glass fabricator. The company grew to become Guardian Industries, a top-100 supplier to the worldwide automotive industry. As the industry returned to civilian vehicle production after the Second World War, two new companies, Siegel-Robert Automotive and Automotive Molding Company (AMC), supplied manufacturers with plating and injection molding in plastic exterior body components.
Siegel-Robert would eventually pioneer chrome-plated plastics in the 1960’s. By the late 1960’s, the operations of Guardian Industries had expanded to include windshield fabricating, 10 automotive glass distribution centers, and a photofinishing division, the strong roots for the next steps in Guardian Industries automotive history.

Eight Principles. One proven approach.
Market-Based Management® is a way for organizations to succeed by helping others improve their lives. It is the business philosophy and framework that we apply to innovate, improve and transform ourselves in order to create greater value and find fulfillment. Our MBM® Guiding Principles are who we are as a company and they guide everything we do.
Market-Based Management® (MBM®) is the engine that powers the Guardian family of companies. MBM is an holistic approach to management that integrates theory and practice and prepares organizations to deal successfully with the challenges of growth and change. The theory of MBM is rooted in five dimensions:
Vision:
 Determining where and how the organization can create the greatest long-term value.
Virtue and Talents:
 Helping ensure that people with the right values, skills and capabilities are hired, retained and developed.
Knowledge Processes:
 Creating, acquiring, sharing and applying relevant knowledge, and measuring and tracking profitability.
Decision Rights:
 Ensuring the right people are in the right roles with the right authority to make decisions and holding them accountable.
Incentives:
 Rewarding people according to the value they create for the organization.
When these dimensions are applied in an integrated, mutually reinforcing manner, they create continuous transformation and positive growth.
