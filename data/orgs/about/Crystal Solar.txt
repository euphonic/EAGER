Crystal Solar was  founded in 2008 and has developed a breakthrough manufacturing technology  called Direct Gas to Waferâ„¢ that allows for direct conversion of feedstock  gas to mono crystalline silicon wafers by high throughput epitaxial  growth.  By skipping the polysilicon,  ingoting and wire-sawing steps altogether, our patented approach results not  only in the lowest cost/watt for wafers but also significantly reduces the  capital required to set up a manufacturing plant. 
These so called kerfless wafers have achieved  well over 24% efficiency in  customer trials and are now enabling existing crystalline cell and module  makers to significantly enhance their power output while reducing cell making  steps, thereby radically reducing the cost structure of PV solar panels.
