NexGen Power Systems is revolutionizing power electronics with technology solutions utilizing GaN on GaN discrete semiconductor devices, modules, and systems that increase efficiency and reliability of power conversion systems while dramatically reducing their cost, size, and weight.
We have assembled a world-class team of engineers with proven track records in inventing, developing, and commercializing semiconductor technologies. Our internal expertise and competence encompasses GaN epitaxial growth, materials characterization, device design and processing, electrical characterization, reliability testing, and product development.
Our focus is in developing and manufacturing vertical power semiconductor devices built in homoepitaxial GaN layers formed on bulk GaN substrates. We have established licensing and supply agreements with multiple GaN substrate vendors, giving us access to the highest quality and lowest cost bulk GaN substrates.
