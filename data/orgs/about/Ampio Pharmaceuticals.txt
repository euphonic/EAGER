Ampio is an innovative drug discovery and development company combining scientific, regulatory, and business capabilities to efficiently develop a robust portfolio of novel therapeutic candidates.  These therapeutic candidates, if approved, will address significant inflammatory conditions for which limited treatment options exist.
Ampio’s therapeutic product pipeline has been developed through more than two decades of study at leading hospital-based research centers. Rigorous preclinical and clinical research efforts have yielded a diverse portfolio of late-stage product candidates focusing on the world’s most prevalent inflammatory conditions including osteoarthritis and diabetic macular edema.
Significant discoveries in both basic science and clinical research have resulted in Ampio receiving over 180 patents throughout the world, with hundreds more pending.  Further, hundreds of peer-reviewed publications, abstracts, and scientific presentations highlight the depth of research supporting Ampio’s therapeutic product candidates.
Ampio’s leading product candidates are Ampion™ and Optina™.  The company is currently conducting the second pivotal clinical trial in the US for Ampion, a biologic intra-articular injection being studied for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the knee.  Ampio is also conducting a late-stage US clinical trial for Optina, an oral agent being studied for the treatment of diabetic macular edema.  Millions of patients worldwide are affected by these conditions, for which limited treatment options exist.
At Ampio, we strive to offer compelling therapeutic options for the patients most in need of new treatments, and we operate every day to advance our products’ development and make these available to patients.

Optina is a novel, ultra-low dose of danazol being developed for the oral treatment of diabetic macular edema.
Danazol is an established, synthetic derivative of modified testosterone ethisterone that affects vascular endothelial cell linkage in a biphasic manner. Ultra-low dose danazol (as formulated in Optina) decreases vascular permeability by increasing the barrier function across endothelial cells, indicating the potential to treat multiple angiopathies. Further, danazol increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels through the rapid activation of membrane-associated androgen, steroid binding globulin, and calcium channel receptors. With the ultra-low dose contained in our novel Optina formulation, danazol binds to androgen and steroid binding globulin receptors stimulating the formation of a cortical actin ring to enhance endothelial cell barrier function. When organized into a cortical ring, filamentous actin (f-actin) increases the barrier function of endothelial cells by tethering adhesion molecule complexes to the cytoskeleton. In this orientation, increased cortical actin improves tight junctions which strengthen cell-to-cell adhesions, thereby restricting leakage (edema) across the cell membrane. A large, late-stage clinical trial is identified to start in the US for the oral treatment of diabetic macular edema. Additional future indications for Optina are being researched. One hundred thirty four patents are currently issued for Optina with 50 pending applications worldwide.

About Ampion™ for the Treatment of pain due to Osteoarthritis of the Knee
Ampion is a low molecular weight fraction of human serum albumin (HSA) currently being developed for the treatment of pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee.
The primary constituent ingredient of Ampion is aspartyl-alanyl diketopiperazine, or DA-DKP, an endogenous immunomodulatory molecule derived from the N-terminus of HSA. Based on published pre-clinical and clinical research, DA-DKP plays a significant role in the regulation of inflammation. DA-DKP is believed to reduce inflammation by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine production in T-cells. Ampion also contains other known small molecules that confer anti-inflammatory effects to complement the activity of DA-DKP and derive demonstrated 
in-vitro
 and 
in-vivo
 effects. We believe this non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory biologic agent has the potential to treat a broad range of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions as well as immune-mediated diseases. Ampio is currently developing Ampion as an intra-articular injection to treat osteoarthritis of the knee, and the final US pivotal trial is underway.  Additional pre-clinical and clinical studies have been completed or are underway for Ampion and other chronic inflammatory conditions. Fifty six patents are currently issued for Ampion throughout the world.

Contact UsOsteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting over 100 million people in the United States with over 48 million people suffering from osteoarthritis of the knee. It is a progressive disorder of the joints involving degradation of the intra-articular cartilage, joint lining, ligaments, and bone. The incidence of developing osteoarthritis of the knee over a lifetime is approximately 45%. Certain risk factors in conjunction with natural wear and tear lead to the breakdown of cartilage. Osteoarthritis is a chronic, progressive condition caused by inflammation of the soft tissue and bony structures of the joint, which worsens over time and leads to progressive thinning of articular cartilage. Other progressive effects include narrowing of the joint space, synovial membrane inflammation and thickening, osteophyte formation and increased density of subchondral bone. Inflammation of the synovium interrupts the natural chondrocyte metabolism, which is responsible for the production and maintenance of cartilage’s extracellular matrix. Osteoarthritic synovial fluid activates pro-inflammatory cytokines in active chondrocytes through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. The cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-), interleukin-17 (IL-17), and interleukin-18 (IL-18), stimulate the synthesis of matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) whose enzymatic activity leads to the degeneration of cartilage.
The global osteoarthritis therapeutics market continues to expand and is expected to exceed $3 billion by 2015. Despite the size and growth of the osteoarthritis of the knee market, few adequate treatment options currently exist for this chronic, debilitating disease.

Type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus affects 26 million people in the United States. One of the many symptoms of diabetes is the local and systemic inflammation of the microvascular system. Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes and is characterized by damage to the blood vessels of the retina and can either be proliferative or non-proliferative. Proliferative damage occurs when a reduction in oxygen levels in the retina due to impaired glucose metabolism causes fragile blood vessels to grow in the vitreous humor. Non-proliferative damage occurs when existing vessels experience poor endothelial cell linkage due to increased blood glucose levels and hypertension. Macular edema is the most common form of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In diabetic macular edema, prolonged hyperglycemia compromises endothelial cell linkage leading to vascular permeability. The leakage of fluid, solutes, proteins and immune cells cause the macula to swell and thicken. This leads to damage of the central retinal tissue and cany significantly impair sharp central vision. The prevalence of diabetes is 11.3% of the population above the age of 20, with an annual incidence of 1.9 million cases in the United States alone. In this population, the prevalence of diabetic macular edema is estimated at 30% of patients inflicted by the disease for 20 years or more.
