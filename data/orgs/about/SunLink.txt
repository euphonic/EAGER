About
Solar has accounted for more than 25% of new electric capacity added to the U.S. grid over the past five years, including 2016 when it installed more new capacity than any other fuel source.
Over the next five years, the U.S. will install a staggering 61,000MW+ of solar capacity, 14% more than has been installed over the industry’s entire 40-year history.
