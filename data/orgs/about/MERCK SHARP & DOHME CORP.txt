 Antibiotic Research
For more than 80 years, Merck has contributed to the discovery and development of novel medicines and vaccines to combat infectious disease. Today, Merck is a global leader in antimicrobials with a proud heritage, broad portfolio and innovative pipeline.
OUR HISTORY
Merck's Research Laboratories played a central role in the development of antimicrobials
                        
Merck, in collaboration with Rutgers University, developed one of the first methods for mass production of penicillin
Merck markets a number of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral products and vaccines for the treatment or prevention of infectious diseases in markets around the globe
We're not done yet. We need to maintain our commitment and our interest and continue to bring our full capability set to trying to do more to help solve the problem of infectious disease.
”
executive vice president & chief patient officer, Merck
A Message from Julie L. Gerberding, M.D., M.P.H., executive vice president & chief patient officer, Merck
MERCK IS COMMITTED TO:
Maintaining active R&D programs
 to address unmet medical needs in the prevention and treatment of infectious disease
Monitoring trends
 in antibacterial resistance as exemplified by our longstanding commitment to surveillance studies
Supporting responsible use
 of antimicrobials to help slow development of resistance and preserve current therapeutic options
Advocating for improvements
 in regulatory guidance and financial incentives to support and accelerate innovation in the development of new antimicrobials, vaccines, services and solutions
“
Merck is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies with a continued focus on anti-infective research and development. We develop treatments for serious infections and promote appropriate use of these products. As such, the need for patient-centered antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) is fundamental to our work.
”
Antimicrobial Stewardship, Merck
READ OUR PUBLIC POLICY REGARDING
 ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE
FINDING SOLUTIONS TO ANTIMICROBIAL RESISTANCE
There is a critical need for solutions to manage the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance.
INNOVATION
Research and innovation will lead to the development of new antibiotics.
STEWARDSHIP
Antimicrobial stewardship promotes the appropriate use of antimicrobials to reduce resistance. 
POLICY
Policies can help spur innovation and regulate the use of antibiotics.
OUR COLLABORATIONS
In addition to our own antimicrobial research efforts, Merck also works with scientists across the world.
Through its Merck Innovation Network (MINt), the company actively collaborates with leading scientists in the antimicrobial field to investigate novel therapeutic targets, evaluate new pathways for drug targeting and develop novel tools and technologies. Merck has a number of ongoing collaborations with scientists at universities including Harvard, Yale and Princeton.
THE RACE AGAINST RESISTANCE - A CONTEST WITH NO FINISH LINE
Dalya Guris, M.D., M.P.H., executive director, Clinical Research, Merck Research Laboratories, on leading our product development teams, a dedicated group of people committed to being one step ahead in the fight against disease-causing bacteria.
LEARN MORE
The Unique Role of Public Policy in Addressing Antimicrobial Resistance
Nicole Mahoney, director, Global Regulatory Policy, Merck, on how antimicrobial resistance is forcing policy makers to rethink the way diseases are managed, from how infections are diagnosed and tracked to how anti-infectives are developed and used.

HUMANS FOR HEALTH
Curiosity, inventiveness, and a passion for excellence. These are qualities that drive Merck people to discover what’s possible as they work to help improve health around the world.
See our latest story
"It's Personal" Series
"Women in Science" Series
Faces of the Future
"For every question, there’s really an answer, you sometimes just have to spend a little bit more time thinking about it and take a step back and look at what’s actually in front of you."
James Fells
"In our labs and across the industry, we are seeing how human genetics can help determine if a patient will respond to a certain medication."
Caroline Fox
"I came here because science and innovation drive this company. I believe that my best day at work — the day my team makes a potentially life-changing discovery — is still ahead of me. It’s the reason why I stay."
Rob Garbaccio
"As a scientist, there's nowhere else like Merck to work. I can do basic research, apply it to an important problem, and see the results. How can you get better than that?"
John Howe
"We get to invent every single day, sometimes it’s little things, sometimes it's big things."
Stephanie Barrett
"We are trying to understand biology in new and different ways to find new targets for drug discovery."
Luis Zúñiga
"I think diverse teams are certainly our strongest teams, and I think we, as women, have a lot to add."
Rebecca T. Ruck
"My first-hand experience with neurological diseases gives me the passion and motivation to go out and try to tackle really hard questions."
Angela Jablonski
"As scientists, we have the flexibility to ask the big questions, the important ones that will come into play 5 to 10 years from now. These are the kind of questions that will drive innovation."
Dan Cua
"We are all inquisitive, ambitious, and hard-working. The caliber of science that’s discussed just in the hallway or at a water cooler is incredible. And, it's inspiring to know that our ideas can be supported by Merck’s resources and technology."
Gokul Swaminathan
"Everybody comes to work from a different place...We want to use that unique perspective to further the business."
Jay Schiller
"At Merck…I feel that whatever path I want to carve for my career, it’s possible."
Harriet Johnson
"The people I work with have become my family. There's a strong sense of camaraderie, especially within Merck and our neuroscience department."
Paige Cramer
"What’s most exciting to me is having the flexibility to explore completely new areas of disease biology."
Daria Hazuda
"I feel fortunate that I've been able to work on the basic science end of our fight against HIV."
Dr. Michael Thien
"We try never to forget that medicine is for the people."
George W. Merck
"I enjoy impacting how other people do scientific research and allowing them to take what we’ve learned and apply it to their own situations and their own problems."
Chris Kistler
"What’s so cool about working at Merck is that the problem solving we do, using cutting-edge research and science, results in positive impact to people's lives and their quality of life."
Jason Cheung
"To have the opportunity to do the research that I do day-to-day here as well as the luxury of being able to do research on the International Space Station makes me feel incredibly lucky."
Paul Reichert
"What is most exciting is to be able to invent a new sort of chemical reaction one day, and use it in drug discovery the next day. And that’s just something that doesn’t happen in academia."
Spencer Dreher
"A job at Merck is not just a job, it's a career. The company has a commitment to you and to your future."
Daisy Richardson

OUR 
HISTORY
We've done great things in the past.
Today, we're doing great things for the future.
Meeting tomorrow’s health care challenges will require more of the same dedication that has made us a leader in the health care industry. This video, created to celebrate our 125th anniversary, highlights our past discoveries and our promises for the future.

							Since 1891, our researchers have helped to find new ways to treat and prevent illness — from the discovery of vitamin B1, to the first measles vaccine, to cold remedies and antacids, to the first statins to treat high cholesterol. Our scientists have also helped develop many products to improve animal health, including vaccines and antibiotics. Today, as a premier research-intensive biopharmaceutical company, we’re focused on making important scientific advancements within hepatitis C, HIV, diabetes and immuno-oncology.
						

							While we are proud of our past, we are enthusiastic about the future. We aim to create a healthier, brighter future for people around the world.
