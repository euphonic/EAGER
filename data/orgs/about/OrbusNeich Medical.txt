History
In 2005, Neich Medical acquired longstanding partner Orbus Medical Technologies to form OrbusNeich.
Neich Medical, founded in 1979, boasted a strong distribution network and deep roots in the Asia Pacific interventional medical community. Orbus Medical Technologies, founded in 1996, had its foundations in the research and development of interventional medical devices, with strong ties in the European medical community. Our two companies were a natural fit and became OrbusNeich.
We believe our products change lives and deliver the best quality of life for patients. We work closely with our physician partners to understand and meet their needs and those of their patients.

Q & A
About Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)
What is heart disease?
Coronary artery disease (CAD),
 also called coronary 
heart disease
, or simply 
heart
 disease, happens when plaque builds up in the arteries, blocking blood flow. It can lead to a heart attack and can cause permanent damage to the heart muscle.
Over time, CAD can weaken the heart muscle, contributing to heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms, called 
arrhythmias
. If the heart can't pump blood effectively, the lungs, brain and other organs won't work properly and may be damaged or even shut down.
For both men and women, CAD is the leading cause of death around the world.
