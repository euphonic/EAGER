Vision
​
The vision of Atom Optoelectronics is to innovate scalable and high throughput printing technologies for low-cost, high-performance optoelectronic devices in order to make them available for every person. Atom Optoelectronics focuses on developing printed Single-walled Carbon Nanotubes (SWCNT) electronics and SWCNT display backplanes that will become pervasive around the world. Atom Optoelectronics has developed processes to print organic light emitting diodes (OLED) on top of printed SWCNT display backplanes. Atom Optoelectronics is working toward building a manufacturing base for printed Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode (AMOLED) displays and becoming a dominant worldwide supplier of the next generation displays. 
Atom Optoelectronics is a company founded in 2013, located on 440 Hindry Ave Unit E, Los Angeles, CA 90301. The company was founded to fulfill a need in supplying nanomaterials on insulators and silicon substrates to the defense sector for high frequency device/circuit applications. 
Atom Optoelectronics will lead its commercialization efforts by utilizing its deep knowledge in nanoelectronics applications and leveraging resources and expertise from University of California at Santa Barbara and Los Angeles.
