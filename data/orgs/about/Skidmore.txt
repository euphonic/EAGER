CREATIVE THOUGHT MATTERS
Creativity is at our core.
It changes the way we think. It influences our work, our actions and the people we’re
                                    becoming. Creativity empowers us, drives us and opens us to combine different ideas,
                                    try new things and look at the world from a wide range of perspectives.
                                 
At Skidmore, no matter what you’re meant to be, do or inspire – Creative Thought Matters.
                                    And that makes all the difference.

Creative Thought Matters
"Creative Thought Matters" is not just a slogan at Skidmore College—it's something
                           we believe in wholeheartedly. It is a way of life. It is a brand promise to students
                           that no matter what they choose to study, they will be active participants in an academic
                           and extracurricular environment that is richly influenced by literature, arts, culture
                           and ideas. What they learn will be brought to life by Skidmore's historic and highly
                           prized "hand and mind" tradition that values and rewards real-world actions and outcomes.

Mission Statement
The principal mission of Skidmore College is the education of predominantly full-time
                                 undergraduates, a diverse population of talented students who are eager to engage
                                 actively in the learning process. The college seeks to prepare liberally educated
                                 graduates to continue their quest for knowledge and to make the choices required of
                                 informed, responsible citizens. Skidmore faculty and staff create a challenging yet
                                 supportive environment that cultivates students’ intellectual and personal excellence,
                                 encouraging them to expand their expectations of themselves while they enrich their
                                 academic understanding.
                              
In keeping with the college’s founding principle of linking theoretical with applied
                                 learning, the Skidmore curriculum balances a commitment to the liberal arts and sciences
                                 with preparation for professions, careers, and community leadership. Education in
                                 the classroom, laboratory, and studio is enhanced by cocurricular and field-experience
                                 opportunities of broad scope.
                              
The college also embraces its responsibility as an educational and cultural resource
                                 for alumni and for a host of nontraditional student populations, and for providing
                                 educational leadership in the Capital District and beyond.

Preservation matters: 
How Skidmore shaped Saratoga
(
The Saratogian,
There would be no Skidmore College were it not for a frail lady with a will of iron
                           who came to Saratoga Springs in 1900 to take the healing waters, fell in love with
                           the charms of the unique resort town and decided to remain.
                        
The daughter of a wealthy coal merchant and widow of publishing scion J. Blair Scribner,
                           Lucy Scribner was almost 50 when she came to Saratoga. Deeply religious, inordinately
                           shy and physically restricted, she disliked frivolous parties and frowned on two of
                           the most popular local entertainments and industries, horse racing and gambling. She
                           decided to invest her inheritance in something more worthwhile: She would start a
                           school where young women of the town could learn skills that would make them self-supporting.
                        
So with the help of other civic-minded neighbors, Lucy Scribner created the Young
                           Women's Industrial Club of Saratoga Springs, whose first curriculum was a blend of
                           practical courses in typewriting, bookkeeping, textile arts, physical education and
                           music and dance. Today we may snicker at the courses in sewing, shirtwaist making
                           and millinery, but these were among the few fields in which women could manage businesses,
                           and those courses were embedded in a broader context of creative expression and aesthetic
                           appreciation.
