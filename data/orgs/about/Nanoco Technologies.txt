Annual General Meeting information
General Meeting InformationYou are here:
NANOCO quantum dots are differentiated from other quantum dot technologies as they do not contain toxic heavy-metals such as cadmium, a known carcinogen. Legislation limiting the use of heavy-metals is becoming increasingly restrictive, to protect consumers and the environment.
The EU’s RoHS Directive, for example, restricts the use of cadmium in materials such as liquids, plastics or coatings to maximum concentrations of 0.01% (100 ppm). Similar legislation is in the pipeline in countries such as China, Korea, Japan and the US.
Nanoco’s innovative technology allows for highly efficient quantum dots to be made that are completely cadmium and heavy-metal free. This uniquely positions Nanoco as one of the few manufacturers able to supply quantum dots which can be used without legislative restrictions on heavy metals content in a whole range of consumer electronics and lighting applications.
Research link
Nanoco’s core intellectual property revolves around four key areas: the company’s proprietary mass production process, CFQD® quantum dot materials, surface chemistry and applications/devices incorporating its materials.
For example, Nanoco has patents surrounding the molecular seeding process for the production of high quality CFQD® quantum dots, cost effectively and on an industrial scale.
This process not only allows the company to produce on a large scale, it also offers precise control over the particle-size, enabling them to provide material to meet any defined specification.
All told, Nanoco now holds ca. 300 granted patents or pending patent applications in these four key areas.
Nanoco’s team consists of highly qualified scientists,
sales, operational and administrative staff recruited from countries all around the world. In total the company has people spanning over 15 nationalities, testifying to the company’s hunger for the best and brightest.
With a Semi-Tech facility in Runcorn, UK, an office in Boston, US, and business development managers working in the USA, Japan, Korea, China and Taiwan, Nanoco has an experienced team with a truly global outlook.
Nanoco’s patented ‘molecular seeding’ process allows for the production of uniform, high quality quantum dots on a large scale.
Nanoco continues to expand its Semi-Tech production capacity to meet the increasing testing and sampling requirements of its customer base.
Nanoco has signed global licensing deals with Dow Electronic Materials, Merck and Wah Hong to
service the display industry. These deals allows our partners to utilize its expertise in high volume manufacturing to market and sell Nanoco’s CFQD® quantum dots for display applications.
