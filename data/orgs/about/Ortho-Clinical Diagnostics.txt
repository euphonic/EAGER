{}A Global Leader of In Vitro Diagnostics
Harnessing the power of reimagination. It's how Ortho Clinical Diagnostics has been transforming in vitro diagnostics for more than 75 years. It's made us a trusted partner of hospitals, hospital networks, blood banks, and labs around the world. And today it's empowering us to advise our customers as they prepare for what's next.
From our earliest work in blood typing to the latest developments in laboratory systems, we've pioneered life-impacting advances. Scientific advances that have helped medical professionals diagnose conditions early and make better-informed treatment decisions. Our legacy inspires us every day and continues to drive us forward.
Today's health care environment is complex. Regulatory standards and scrutiny is increasing, and change is everywhere. In emerging markets there is an ongoing pursuit for higher standards of care, while in developed countries pressures to control costs and seek greater efficiencies are inescapable. At Ortho, we know that scalable and standardized platforms, competitive test menus, and flexible, automated solutions are essential to help navigate this challenging landscape ─ and we are committed to building solutions that address these needs.
Today, we are continuing to redefine what scalability means. We know that wherever testing gets done, whether at a large hospital, a smaller lab or across a network, high-quality, reliable results are the bottom line. It's about simplicity. It's about providing solutions that are designed to enhance medical value and improve patient care. Solutions that are efficient, and automate what were once complicated processes so that medical professionals can focus on what really matters.
Our purpose is simple: to improve and save lives with diagnostics. We do that by reimagining what's possible. It's what defines us. It's the Ortho difference.
