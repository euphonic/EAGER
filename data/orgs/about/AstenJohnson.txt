Paper is our first priority.
Papermakers deserve a true business partner, a partner who understands every aspect of their operations and has a stake in their bottom line. They deserve a partner with the tenacity to develop viable solutions for complex performance issues, a partner who can deliver value beyond merely supplying product. And, they deserve a partner who truly believes in the future success of their industry. AstenJohnson is that partner.
We’re proud to be a preferred manufacturer of paper machine clothing, specialty fabrics and filaments for the worldwide paper industry. Across the globe, papermakers turn to us not only to supply their fabrics, but also to help them improve their productivity and achieve superior results. Turning our expertise into solutions for our customers—that’s what AstenJohnson is all about.
Zero Accident Culture
Safety has long been one of the core values within the AstenJohnson organization. In 2016, we launched a new safety initiative to enhance and communicate our culture of protection, accountability, commitment, and trust.
This initiative, dubbed the Zero Accident Culture (ZAC), is more than just regulation. ZAC is a global effort to create and maintain a safety culture for AstenJohnson through ongoing dialogue and training that emphasizes safe practices in the workplace.
ZAC serves as a reminder of our shared vision for an environment where we all take pride and responsibility in caring for ourselves and for others.

History
History
A tale of two families, 200 years strong.
AstenJohnson’s history
 in the paper industry dates back to 1790, when the Johnson family opened Manchester Wire Works in Manchester, England. Nearly 100 years later, the Asten family launched V. Asten and Company in Belgium, producing felts for European papermakers. The family then started a separate company Asten-Hill Manufacturing Company in Philadelphia in 1931, thirty years after the Johnsons began operations in Montreal.
In 1999, Asten, Inc. and the JWI Group merged; they acquired Asten AG in Eupen, Belgium the following year. Additional changes and acquisitions quickly followed, including the 2003 addition of a sales and marketing office in Singapore, the 2004 opening of a new PMC manufacturing facility in Suzhou, China, and the 2005 acquisition of Czech Republic-based PMC manufacturer, Sitos.
Today, AstenJohnson products are at work in mills throughout the world. Our products help create many kinds of paper, from fine writing press and newsprint to brown paper bags and cardboard boxes. Papermakers in 56 countries trust in and profit from our headbox-to-reel understanding of their operations.
