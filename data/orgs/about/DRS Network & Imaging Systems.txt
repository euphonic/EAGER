ETHICS
The term “ethics” is commonly defined as a set of principles that govern a person’s or group’s behavior.  Ethical behavior has less to do with what may be required by law, and more to do with adherence to established standards of right and wrong that prescribe what a person or group ought to do in a given situation.  In other words, doing what is right because it is the right thing to do. 
Code of Business Ethics & Conduct
At Leonardo DRS, our goal is not solely to comply with the laws that affect our business, but to abide by the highest level of ethical conduct in our business affairs.  We place the utmost importance upon our reputation for honesty, integrity and high standards.  Our core standards are set forth in the Leonardo DRS Code of Business Ethics and Conduct (“Code”) as well as various policies that reaffirm the importance of these standards.  The Code and supporting policies should be viewed as the true expression of the Company’s philosophy and intent. 
At Leonardo DRS, this philosophy starts at the top and permeates every level of the Leonardo DRS organization.  As an initial matter, the Company's Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the effective implementation and execution of our Ethics Program.  To this end, the Board has created an Audit & Ethics Committee which has been delegated authority for oversight of the Company’s Ethics Program.
In addition, the Company’s management team is personally committed to the ideas, principles and procedures described in the Code and supporting policies.  Within each operating unit of the Company, the chief executive of the unit has the overall responsibility for implementing, monitoring and enforcing the tenets set forth in our Code and related policies. 
Finally, our standards of right and wrong are maintained through the actions and conduct of all Leonardo DRS personnel.  Our employees know it is their obligation to conduct themselves in a manner that ensures the maintenance of these standards. Leonardo DRS employees are responsible for ensuring that their own conduct, as well as the conduct of those who report to them, comply with the Company’s principles of right and wrong. 
Our hard-earned reputation for the highest standards of business conduct is of the greatest importance to Leonardo DRS and its employees and vigilant compliance with these standards assures the continuance of Leonardo DRS's reputation for integrity and fair dealing.
The Leonardo DRS Ethics Helpline
The DRS Ethics HelpLine is a confidential resource you can use to let us know about situations where you believe the Company may not have lived up to its stated standards for ethical conduct, or where you believe an issue or concern you have previously reported is not being properly addressed.
The Ethics HelpLine is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Telephone numbers for the HelpLine are shown to the right.
When you call the Ethics HelpLine, a trained staff member will take detailed notes and send a confidential report to DRS.  These calls are not recorded.  DRS uses a third party who specializes in operating and maintaining confidential reporting systems.  This helps assure callers of confidentiality and, when requested, anonymity.
