HELPING
PEOPLE SEE  
LIFE IN THE 
BEST LIGHT
At Transitions Optical, we help 
people live richer, more vibrant 
lives by enhancing their vision and 
the way they perceive light.
THE CUTTING EDGE OF VISUAL ENHANCEMENT
Through continuous innovation, the Transitions
®
 family of  brands protects and enhances vision by adjusting and adapting to  changing light.  Through our partnerships with optical industry leaders,  we offer adaptive solutions in the widest selection of designs and  materials, including hundreds of lens combinations.  And we don’t stop  there; we also make adaptive sunwear and motorcycle helmet shields.  We  are proud to say our lenses are the number-one eyecare  professional-recommended photochromic lenses worldwide.
WE'RE ALWAYS ADAPTING
We are pioneers in light management and home to many firsts.  Since we were founded in 1990, we have expanded from a cramped office with one portable computer in the Tampa Bay area to an eyecare industry leader that is now home to more than 1,500 committed employees globally.
We were the first to successfully commercialize a plastic photochromic lens in 1990.  Our research and development professionals are continuously innovating our everyday adaptive lenses, improving darkness, fade back speed, color, responsiveness and indoor clarity.  In the last few years we’ve continued to make significant advances in color science and lens materials, creating a better photochromic experience that’s available to more people.  We’ve also expanded our family of brands and now have a product for anyone who wants more than a basic lens.  And we’re adapting to new markets through partnerships with brands like Nike
®
, Oakley
®
 and Bell
®
. 
SUSTAINABILITY - OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY
Sustainability is part of our business strategy.  We consider ourselves stewards of the planet’s resources, continuously reducing waste, improving water and energy consumption, and protecting our environment.
HEALTHY VISION FOR ALL
At Transitions Optical we are committed to improving the vision of our communities.  It’s why we continue to provide charitable support and disaster relief in the communities where we operate. Together with our partners at the local, regional and global levels, we are helping children see, creating awareness of the need for eye exams and working to eliminate preventable blindness.  And we are proud of the positive effect that our products have⎯our lenses have helped better the lives of millions of people around the world.
