We’re a company that takes on the toughest health challenges. But we   do more than treat diseases—we aim to make a remarkable impact on   people’s lives. We are AbbVie, a highly focused research-driven   biopharmaceutical company.

We target specific difficult-to-cure diseases where we can leverage   our core R&D expertise to advance science. We’re constantly   working to create solutions that go beyond treating the illness to   have a positive impact on patients’ lives, on societies—and on science itself.
At AbbVie, we see a future full of possibility, where health is in   reach and patient lives are improved. See our employees, our science   and our hope for tomorrow:

Our partners share our commitment to solving the world’s greatest   health needs.

At AbbVie, it’s both what we do and how we do it that matter. We go   beyond medicine, using our resources to improve health care and   communities. We’re committed to:
Improving health outcomes. We’re targeting unmet needs and     working to enhance access to health care across geographies.
Operating responsibly. It’s the very basis of how AbbVie does     business. We are committed to cultivating an ethical, transparent     and inclusive culture to drive sustainable growth.

Our 125-year legacy provides AbbVie a set of deeply held values.   These guide our way, driving how we treat our patients and each other   and how we design our strategies and operate our business. And they   keep us focused on what matters most—our patients and our people.

Our History
AbbVie may have been founded in 2013, but our roots run deep. In   2013, we became a separate company from Abbott, though we share a   common legacy and strong prospects for future success.
Our name represents our connection to the past and the future. When   we became our own company, AbbVie formed a new kind of enterprise—a   biopharmaceutical company. We blend the stability, global scale,   resources and commercial capabilities of a pharmaceutical company with   the focus and culture of a biotech.
Today, our ~30,000 employees around the world focus on delivering   transformational medicines and therapies that offer significant   patient benefits.

AbbVie is committed to being fully transparent and compliant with our   policies and disclosures.
Our Policies
AbbVie’s public policy engagement is guided by the following principles:
AbbVie is committed to     transparency and is guided by our  Code of Business Conduct  in all public policy   engagement.
AbbVie pursues activities that shape policies to     benefit patients, with a focus on improving patient access to new     medical advances.
Our Federal Government Affairs office in Washington, D.C. is   responsible for advocacy activities with the U.S. Congress and the   federal government. Advocacy at the U.S. state level is managed by our   State Government Affairs function. AbbVie also hires outside firms   that can provide expertise on our key policy issues. AbbVie does not   currently make direct expenditures for US federal and state grassroots   lobbying communications to the general public. Additionally, AbbVie   does not currently contribute funds intended for use in elections to   501(c)(4) organizations but, should such a contribution be made in the   future, it would be listed with AbbVie’s other corporate political contributions.
In the United States, in compliance with the Lobbying Disclosure   Act, AbbVie will file a quarterly report that includes: (i) total   federal lobbying expenditures, (ii) the name of the specific piece of   legislation or subject that was the topic of communication, (iii)   disclosure of AbbVie individuals who lobbied on behalf of AbbVie, and   (iv) identification of the legislative body or executive branch that   was contacted. This report incorporates expenses associated with   lobbying the federal government, including our Federal Government   Affairs office and the portion of trade association dues associated   with federal lobbying. We file similar publicly-available lobbying   reports with states, as required by law, available  here .
Our Report on Political Contributions
AbbVie participates in the political process by contributing to U.S.   state and local candidates and political organizations. We support   candidates and organizations that understand how government actions   can affect patients’ access to medical advances and that will work to   promote an environment that fosters continued medical progress.
Contributions to office holders and candidates are bipartisan and   based on several criteria: policy positions that reflect AbbVie’s   interests; representation of geographic areas where AbbVie employees   and facilities are located; relevant legislative committee   assignments; ability to be elected; and need for financial assistance.   The private political preferences of AbbVie’s executives do not play a   role in how corporate political funds are spent.
The Executive Vice President, External Affairs, and the Vice   President, Government Affairs, each review and approve all corporate   political contributions at the recommendation of AbbVie’s Government   Affairs function to ensure these contributions are consistent with the   company’s guidelines and in accordance with applicable laws as   required by the Corporate Political Contributions Policy. The Public   Policy Committee of the AbbVie Board of Directors reviews the   Corporate Political Contributions Policy every three years or more   frequently and is periodically briefed on the corporate contributions   made by AbbVie.
When available, AbbVie will provide links to AbbVie’s corporate   contributions to political candidates, political parties, political   committees, ballot measure committees, and organizations operating   under 26 USC Sec. 527 of the Internal Revenue Code. AbbVie’s corporate   political contribution reports are updated every six months and are   archived for reference.
Our Membership in Trade Associations
AbbVie is a member of trade associations that are aligned with our   business objectives. In the interest of transparency, the trade   associations to which AbbVie provides $50,000 or more in annual   membership support may be found  here . AbbVie also posts a list of trade   associations around the world where an AbbVie employee serves on the   organization’s board of directors, which are listed  here . The Public Policy Committee of the AbbVie   Board of Directors also reviews these memberships.
Independence
The independence of patient groups will not be compromised. AbbVie   encourages patient groups to maintain relationships with a wide range   of organizations and companies.
Transparency
All support will be disclosed according to relevant laws and patient   groups will recognize company support through locally appropriate   means. Both AbbVie and patient groups will have final approval on all   public uses of their respective name, logo and identifying symbols.
Trust and mutual respect
Through a mutual and open understanding of each other’s policies,   objectives and working practices, AbbVie will demonstrate respect for   our partners as we each work toward common desired outcomes. When   providing information on marketed and investigational medicines,   AbbVie will do so in compliance with applicable local laws,   regulations, policies and procedures.
AbbVie believes in being a socially responsible company and doing   what is right, not just by our customers, but by the world in which we   live. AbbVie is committed to safe and fair working conditions, beyond   our employees and the stores in which our products are sold, but also   extending to the partners in our supply chain. AbbVie has a global   policy against trafficking and slavery in supply chains. AbbVie   engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and   address risks of human trafficking and slavery. The verification is   conducted by AbbVie employees in AbbVie Purchasing and Supplier   Management. Additionally, AbbVie or a third party that is independent   of supply chain management conducts audits of suppliers (usually   announced ahead of time) to evaluate supplier compliance with company   standards for trafficking and slavery.
AbbVie’s Code of Business Conduct sets forth our commitment to   conduct our business with the highest ethical standards and comply   with all laws and regulations. AbbVie employees worldwide certify   annually on AbbVie’s Code of Business Conduct. AbbVie expects its   business partners, such as contract workers, vendors, suppliers and   consultants, to adhere to ethical behavior consistent with the spirit   of AbbVie’s Code of Business Conduct and to all applicable laws and   regulations when working on behalf of AbbVie.
AbbVie’s Supplier Code of Conduct  states our   expectations to suppliers conducting business with AbbVie that they   are prohibited from engaging in illegal behavior, including human   trafficking and slavery. AbbVie requires direct suppliers to certify   that materials incorporated into AbbVie’s products comply with local   and national laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the   country or countries in which they are doing business. Certifications   are also obtained from suppliers that they comply with standards as   outlined in our Supplier Code of Conduct. AbbVie will maintain   internal accountability standards and procedures for both employees   and contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery   and trafficking.
Employees and contractors assigned to AbbVie who fail to abide by   AbbVie’s Code of Business Conduct may be subject to reprimand or other   adverse consequences, up to and including termination of employment or   assignment. AbbVie provides training to its employees and management   who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, regarding   human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating   risks within the supply chains of products.
AbbVie’s ethics and compliance program (the “Program”) reflects our   commitment to compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to   our business, including the California Health and Safety Code   §§119400-119402 (the “California Act”). Interested parties may  view the Program online  or may also call   800-254-0462 for a copy of any of the Program materials.
In accordance with the California Act, AbbVie has established a   specific annual dollar limit of $1,000, which applies to promotional   materials, items and activities provided by an employee of AbbVie to   covered recipients in California. In addition, the following expenses   are excluded from the limit: expenses of a de minimis value (i.e.,   with a value of $10 or less), expenses that are directly associated   with payments statutorily excluded from the limit (e.g., meals for   consultants), items provided to health care professionals that are   ultimately intended for patients or consumers, fellowships, receptions   at third-party educational or professional meetings, and sales aids.   To the best of its knowledge, AbbVie declares that as of June 30,   2018, it is in all material respects in compliance with the   requirements of the California Act.
