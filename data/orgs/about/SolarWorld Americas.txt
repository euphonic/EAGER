© 2009 - 2018 SolarWorld Americas Inc. This website is powered by clean, renewable energy.Powering American Homes and Businesses for more than 40 Years
1975 – SolarWorld Americas is the longest operating solar manufacturer in the western hemisphere. Built from the distinguished lineage of ARCO, Siemens, and Shell, we continue the legacy of world class manufacturing and innovative product development. 
First 1-megawatt of solar panels manufactured in a year
1980 - What took us a year to make now takes us less than a day. The technology has come a long way from our early days.
First UL-listed solar module
1982 – Ours were the first solar panels to meet the premier standard of electrical safety validated by the Underwriters Laboratories.
First grid-tied megawatt solar system
1982 – We manufactured the panels, engineered and developed this historic project in the California desert.  During its lifetime, this system produced many megawatt-hours of energy.
First net zero residential solar development
1985 - A community in the Phoenix, Arizona area is was the first ever residential community to achieve net zero status – generating more power than they consume – thanks in large part to the large American-made solar panel array they share access to.
First manufacturer to 100 megawatts
1996 - This historic achievement took us 21 years to achieve, but these days SolarWorld can manufacture 100 megawatts in less than a month.
First all-black crystalline silicon solar module
1987 – We were the first company to make all-black solar panels available to residential solar customers. 
First plus-sorted solar modules, ensuring at least nameplate power
2008 - Watts+ sorting launches, guaranteeing modules will produce a minimum of their nameplate value when sold.
First 25-year warranty on solar panels
1997 – After more than two decades of manufacturing solar panels, we became confident that our panels could last at least 25 years and still be producing at 80% of their original power.  Now we can point to hundreds of systems that have performed beyond these standards even with 25-year or older technology.
First 25-year linear warranty
2009 - SolarWorld introduces the industry's first 25-year linear warranty. SolarWorld is the first to issue a guarantee that our panels will decrease in power by no more than 0.7% per year, resulting in no less than 80% of nameplate performance in year 25. 
First commercial volumes of mono PERC modules
2012 - SolarWorld was the first company to take the high-powered mono PERC (Passivated Emitter Rear Contact) cell technology and use it to produce both cells and solar panels in commercial quantities.
First company to reach 42 continuous years of solar panel manufacturing
2017 – SolarWorld reaches 42 continuous years of American solar panel manufacturing, and launches its SolarWorld Assurance Warranty Protection. The program provides additional peach of mine to residential and small commercial system owners.
