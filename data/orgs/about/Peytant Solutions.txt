Unmet Clinical Need
Luminal diseases can lead to blockages in blood vessels or tubular structures in your body. Metallic and synthetic-covered stents are used to open these structures; however, your body may recognize the implants as foreign materials and respond with a negative reaction. This rejection leads to numerous complications including restenosis, inflammation, infection, allergic responses, scarring and thrombosis.
Amnion-covered stents may alleviate the complications associated
with metallic and synthetic-covered stents.
Technology
AMStent™ Solution
The AMStent™ is the first stent fully covered in amnion tissue, a proven biomaterial with regenerative properties. It has the promise to keep lumens open longer with potentially fewer complications than bare metal stents, covered stents or drug-eluting stents.
A Proven Biomaterial that Promotes Healing
More than 100 years of clinical history with a growing list of applications
Wound and burn management
Supports natural endothelialization and the regeneration of healthy tissue
Anti-inflammatory property minimizes the foreign body response
Anti-microbial property reduces the risk of infection
Anti-fibrotic property minimizes obstructive granuloma formation
Anti-thrombotic property minimizes thrombus formation
A Platform Technology that Solves Challenges in Luminal Disease Treatment
Designed to restore and maintain long-term lumen patency
The AMStent™ combines the regenerative properties of amnion tissue and mechanical properties of a stent frame
Thin, compliant amnion allows for stent delivery through a smaller catheter
A 10 mm AMStent™ can be delivered using an 8 Fr catheter, unlike other covered stents of that size which require an 11 Fr catheter
A Tracheobronchial Stent Designed for
Palliative Care to Improve Quality of Life
The AMStent™ is fully covered in amnion tissue, which provides a bed for natural endothelialization to support the regeneration of healthy tissue
Healthy re-epithelialization re-establishes mucociliary escalation and minimizes migration
Complication/reintervention rates for current metallic tracheal stents range approximately 20-40%1-10
Anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory properties of the amnion tissue may minimize complications and mitigate reintervention
