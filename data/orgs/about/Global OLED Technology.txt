Global OLED Technology LLC ("GOT") was formed in  December 2009 by a group of investors who purchased Kodak's OLED Business.
By virtue of this acquisition, GOT now possesses more than two thousand patents  encompassing a  heritage of innovation  beginning in the early 1980s when foundational Organic Light Emitting Diode  ("OLED") intellectual property was created and incubated within  Kodak’s research and development labs.
GOT recently opened an office in the greater Washington DC  Metro area, where a talented team manages the procurement and maintenance of  GOT’s intellectual property and licenses GOT's patent portfolio to technology  companies globally.
