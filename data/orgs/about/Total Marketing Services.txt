Total – Energy is Our History
Energy is Total's history. Having produced oil and gas for nearly a century, Total has also branched out into renewable energies and electric power. As a global energy leader, we leverage our pioneering spirit and capacity for innovation to address new challenges and prepare for the future. Our 20-year ambition is to become the responsible energy major.
Total,   
From 1920 to the Present
Total's history began in 1924, with the creation of Compagnie Française des Pétroles (CFP). At the time, we produced oil in the Middle East. Over the years, we have expanded internationally and diversified into gas, refining, petrochemicals and petroleum product marketing, as well as solar power, bioenergies and energy storage. We have been innovating for nearly 100 years to meet our customers' expectations.

Five Strong Values Embedded in Our DNA
Like our history, the values of Safety, Respect for Each Other, a Pioneer Spirit, the need to Stand Together and a Performance-Minded attitude represent that part of Total’s identity that is shared by all. Day in, day out, these values guide our actions and our relationships with stakeholders while serving as the foundations for achieving our collective ambition, which is to become the responsible energy major.

	Safety is a daily battle that needs to be waged with humility and vigilance. We can never drop our guard with respect to Safety. It is a core component of our responsibility as an industrial company as well as the linchpin of our long-term viability, because we can only be sustainable if we are safe and reliable. 

	For this reason, we believe that Safety deserves to be more than just a priority: it should be a value. This means that we have to be uncompromising when it comes to Safety and always treat it as a matter of both individual and collective responsibility. At Total, one person’s safety is everyone’s safety.

	Based on this mindset, we can achieve our objective of being recognized as 
the benchmark for safety in our industry.

	Respect for Each Other is a value in which every word has equal weight. It puts people at the center of our collective project. Each day, we strive to embody this principle by maintaining good work relations and listening to each other, paying the utmost respect to human rights, displaying unwavering integrity, embracing diversity and paying attention to the quality of labor relations within the company. 

	Respect for Each Other is therefore a cornerstone of our 
collective ethical principles
, our way of demonstrating the exemplary conduct expected of us as one of the world’s biggest companies.
Our Human Rights Initiatives
We are the first oil and gas major to publish a dedicated report on upholding human rights in our operations. Based on United Nations guidelines, the report explains to the public how we incorporate human rights into our operations and business relationships in our many host countries.

A Pioneer Spirit is woven into 
our history
. Because our domestic resources are virtually nonexistent, we have had to cultivate this Pioneer Spirit to build our business and develop strong positions all around the world. In doing so, we have risen to the rank of energy major. 
Continually spurring us on, this Pioneer Spirit gives us the boldness, sense of adventure and courage to conquer new territories and resolutely embark on a strategy that welcomes other energies. Every day, it encourages us to be curious and innovative and teaches us how to adapt and overcome adversity. This value has driven us in the past, still drives us today and will continue to do so tomorrow.
Looking Ahead to Secure a Share of Future Markets
Anticipating the shift to an economy where electricity will be in greater demand, Total has made a number of acquisitions, including Saft, the world leader in advanced technology batteries, Lampiris, a natural gas and green power company operating in the residential market, and PitPoint, a leading European provider of natural gas vehicle fuel.
Saft acquisition: read the press release
Stand Together reflects how we interact, as seen in the team spirit that enables us to confidently face the unknown together. Even though Total has some 98,000 employees, we still rightly think of ourselves as “family”.
With respect to our employees, we Stand Together to empower everyone to grow in a caring environment and draw support from our strength as a team. Outside the organization, this value compels us to shoulder our responsibilities, whether in business or to society. Above and beyond our contractual obligations, we work hand-in-hand with local communities to foster development in our host countries.
