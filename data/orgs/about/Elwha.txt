The Klallam lived off the land and the water given to them by the creator.  They traveled mainly by cedar dugout canoes, but also had many trails.  They had runners that delivered messages from village to village.  The messengers would literally run the trails between villages to pass along news and announcements to other bands of Klallam.
A common misperception is that the Klallam did not travel into the mountains. Klallam families traveled up and over the Olympic Mountains to gather medicinal plants, berries, bear grass, and cattails, as well as to hunt for bear, deer, and elk.  Villages were on the shores of the Straits, as well as upriver.  Some areas were occupied on a seasonal basis, and some places year-round.  The Elwha River was a natural byway for subsistence activities, and also for social gatherings.
One Klallam mother hiked up the Elwha and over to Taholah at the mouth of the Quinault River every summer with her five children to visit relatives.  The Klallam considered the Olympic Mountains sacred, and revered the mountains’ glory.​

Hunter John
​​The oldest known ancestor from the Klallam who lived on the Elwha was Hunter John. He lived in a village where Indian Creek spills into the Elwha. This village was called titiʔə́ɬ.
He also homesteaded. He was famous for his ability to hunt. Whenever he went out to hunt, he always brought something back to the village. To become a hunter was very prestigious during this time.
Hunter John was born in 1782 and died in 1912. He lived to be 130 years old! He lived during the time of early explorers and up until when the lower dam was first being built.
The people who lived down river were known as fishermen; the people who lived up river were known as hunters. The fishermen knew when the hunters were coming down to trade and visit because you could hear the clacking of deer hooves tied to their knees as they ran down the trails.​

.​Written by Jamie Valadez and Carmen Watson-Charles. This information has been modified, only to add additional facts by Brenda Francis, Communicatoins Manager
In August of 2003, artifacts and human remains were found at the village site called č̕ixʷícən, located at the base of Ediz Hook in Port Angeles, Washington. The site is the largest pre-European contact village site excavated in Washington State.
Nestled in the crook of what is now Port Angeles Harbor, the village of Tse-whit-zen (pronounced ch-WHEET-son) flourished for over 2,700 years. The ancient village was one of many in the Klallam territory, which stretched from the Hoko River on the Strait of Juan de Fuca into the Hood Canal. The earliest confirmed settlement at the village site dates back to 750 B.C. — approximately the same time Rome was founded.
The site was found after being buried for 100 years, while construction took place to build parts for the Hood Canal Bridge. During this time construction stopped and the Department of Transportation met with the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe. Together they came up with a plan to remove the artifacts and human remains so that construction could continue. In March of 2004 an agreement and plan was signed.
Construction and the removal of artifacts and human remains began in April of 2004. Eight months later, in December of 2004, all construction stopped. Although there were over 100 archeologists and tribal members working together, there were still numerous human remains and artifacts to be recovered. There were a total of 335 human remains and over 100,000 artifacts recovered.
It is well recorded in historic documents that this area was a Klallam village site. Over a period of 60 years there were many mills built that desecrated the village site, but also preserved the site because when the mills were built, they covered the ground with 15 to 30 feet of back fill.

Boston Charlie
​​A Klallam man named Boston Charlie used to hunt elk in the mountains. He was born in 1828 and died in 1928. He spent his summers in the mountains and had a favorite camping spot where he camped every year. Today it’s called Boston Charlie’s Camp, and it’s located at the base of Cat Peak. Boston Charlie was the last medicine man of the Klallam People.
​​He also helped the early settlers. He would go up to the hot springs to fast, pray and cleanse himself every year. The last time he traveled up into the mountains, he had a very close call. He must have fallen and hurt himself, for he was immobile.
He was weak and didn’t have anything to eat for several days. He told how the sun was going down and a huge being came up from a cliff. He thought to himself, now this is the day I am going to die. This being, called by the Klallams čičay̕íkʷtən (bigfoot), had great big leaves with blueberries and thimbleberries, wet with dew. He put it in Boston’s mouth and then disappeared down the cliff.
Boston survived that ordeal; he was rescued and that was the last time he went up into the mountains.​​

​The archeological investigation that began in 2004 at č̕ixʷícən found over 1,400 features and 64,700 artifacts of stone, bone, antler, and wood. These features included habitation, structures, smokehouses, drying racks, hearths, rock ovens, and ocher features.
Currently, the artifacts are being stored at the Burke Museum. As a result of a legal settlement, the Tribe received $2.5 million to construct a cemetery and curation facility on the site. To date, this money has been used to construct a cemetery and reinter 344 Klallam ancestors. As of 2011 of the $2.5 million settlement, $2.1 million has been spent solely for restoration of the archeological site, leaving a balance of $400,000 dollars.
For the Tribe to reacquire the artifacts that have been recovered from Tse-whit-zen, a curation facility that can hold at least 904 cubic feet of artifacts must be built that will honor the 2006 agreement with the Washington State Department of Transportation, City of Port Angeles, and Port of Port Angeles for a cultural center that will promote educational and research opportunities. This curation facility must be built so that it meets the Secretary of Interior standards for a museum 36 C.F.R. Part 79.​

.Klallam Language
​​​The Klallam Language is the language of the people of the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe, the Port Gamble S’Klallam Tribe, and the Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe.
There are different dialects in the different areas, and wereso between the different villages.
The Klallam Language Program has been in effect since 1992.
The Klallam language has always been spoken on the north shore of Washington’s Olympic Peninsula from the Strait of Juan de Fuca inland into the mountains. It has also been spoken in some other areas such as Beacher Bay on the south of Vancouver Island and on some nearby smaller islands. It is one language in a large family of Native American languages called Salishan or Salish languages that have been spoken in what is now Washington, British Columbia, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana.
Although Klallam is a separate language, it is very closely related to the dialects called Northern Straits: Saanich, Lummi, Samish, Songish, and Sooke. Saanich, Songish, and Sooke have been spoken on southern Vancouver Island and neighboring small islands. Lummi and Samish have been spoken near Bellinghamn on the U.S. side of the border. Most of the words in Klallam are the same or very similar to words in the Northern Straits dialects. A speaker of Lummi, for example, could learn Klallam very easily, and vice versa.
The Klallam language, itself, has several dialects. Elwha Klallam, Becher Bay Klallam, Jamestown Klallam, and Little Boston Klallam are all very, very slightly different from one another in the pronunciation and usage of some words.
Some Klallam Words
The Klallam alphabet is based on a standard set of symbols used in writing many of the Native American languages of the Northwest. Since the Klallam language has several sounds not found in European languages like English, some specific symbols must be used to represent these sounds.
The Klallam words below and the alphabet are from Dr. Timothy Montler’s www.klallam.montler.net . Dr. Montler is the University of North Texas linguistics professor who has worked with the Tribe to preserve the language through writings and recordings.
The site contains more than 2,000 Klallam words, which are accompanied by sound files so that you can hear the pronunciation. The site also contains several stories told in Klallam and interviews with Klallam speakers (Montler).
The Language and the Tribe Today
The Elwha Klallam Tribe was fortunate to have so many Elders recorded as early as 1953. Over 21 Elders were recorded between 1953 and the present by linguists. By the time Congress passed the Native American Language Act in 1990, there were only eight people who could speak the language. Determined to keep the language alive as a spoken language, the Klallam Language Program was developed by the Elwha Klallam Tribe in 1992 to document and preserve the Klallam language by recording and transcribing tapes with tribal elders who spoke the language (Pierre 2003). However, more than just preserving the language, the Tribe wanted the language to come alive again.
Jamie Valdez, who teaches Klallam at the high school, explains the importance of language:
“You have to learn your language; it’s the backbone of your culture. If you don’t learn your language, you can’t truly practice your culture. If you are just practicing without any language, you are just … touching the surface. You have to go deeper and learn the language, you have to use the language. If you want to pray and talk to your ancestors, you have to do it in the language, because that is what they speak and that is what they are going to hear–and not enough people are doing that.”
In 1999, the Klallam language began to be taught at the Port Angeles High School. Over the last 8 years over 200 students have taken two years of Klallam Language. The Klallam Language Program also offers Inter-Tribal aduly language classes, with Jamestown and Port Gamble. Linguist Timothy Montler created Klallam video games and CD-ROM language lessons (Pierre 2003).

More people in the Tribe today are familiar with the Klallam language, and tribal members are beginning to use Klallam once again in speeches at community events (Cultural Advisory Committee 2003). For example, the speech above was written and delivered by Harmony Arakawa at a canoe journey.​​

ConnectAs told by Beatrice Charles, 1994
​When I was a child I lived at Pysht, Washington with my great-grandfather, Tim Pysht. In the evenings we would sit by the fire. My younger brother, Ernie and I would sit at our great-grandfather’s feet. There was a box of kindling nearby. He had his pocket knife and he would be carving shavings that would curl up like a flower.
He’d carve both ends like this and then break it in half. They looked like flowers. My brother and I would take turn handling him the kindling and putting the flowers back in the kindling box. They were used to start a fire in the morning. This was the time of day that he would teach us traditional Klallam values in which to live by.
He would also tell us stories and sing us songs.
I’m going to share with you some of the values I remember great grandpa Tim Pysht taught me as a young girl.
Always respect and help your elders.
Honor your m​other and father. (Don’t talk back to them.)
Never fear death. (You were born to die.)
If a child offered you something you take it with much praise. Because you’re teaching that child to be a giving person and not to be stingy.
If someone made you angry, just turn around and walk away. Don’t answer back because you can’t swallow those bad words back.
Never choose the biggest fruit, because you will always be hungry if you pick the biggest one. (Don’t be selfish, teach moderation.)
Take care of and respect mother earth – take only what you need.​

Take care of and respect Mother Earth – take only what you need.
Walk your path with good morals: specially in front of children and Elders.

Live in honesty and truth.
Never fear death – you were born to die.
Every part of this earth is sacred.

Connect​Klallam families have many celebrations to announce important events like, births, marriages, or name giving. These types of celebrations are called Potlatches.
During a potlatch there is a lot of food and many speeches are made.
Witnesses
Witnesses are called upon during the potlatch. It is the witnesses responsibility to remember all that took place at the potlatch. This is a very important job, and was designated to witnesses back in a time when there was no written language, cameras, or video recorders. It is a witnesses job to remember at any time that you ask them about the potlatch what occurred at that potlatch.
Potlatch Protocol
The guests sing and dance from other families and Tribes. Traditionally the Tribe/Band from the farthest away has the floor at a potlatch first, and it goes in that order. Today, at modern day potlatches, the host will create a schedule of when Tribes/Bands will have the The host is not allowed to perform until the end of the potlatch.
Potlatches also include a giveaway to thank the guests for being witnesses at the event.
Traditionally, potlatches were held in a long house. Long houses were made of cedar with cedar house posts all around and were foremost a home. Because the potlatch was such an important event people wore special clothing, such as button blankets. The same family design found on the entrance poles was stitched into that family’s button blankets. Regalia like button blankets are only found in tribes of the Northwest and Canada, all the way up to Alaska.

There were possibly eight house structures found at the č̕ixʷícən village site. Erna Gunther, the anthropologist who wrote extensively about the Klallams in her publication, Klallam Ethnography, describes the house structures.
The homes were built in a single row, and with the door facing the water. A potlatch house may be 50 by 200 feet in size. The family dwellings were 20 by 30 feet. All the houses had gabled roofs, with the exception of the potlatch house.
The houses are made of wooden planks. The edges of the planks are grooved so that they overlap when placed side by side. When the planks are set in the ground, the side walls are about twelve feet high.
On the inside, a few planks are always left loose so as to be moved to leave smoke holes. There are benches that run along the majority of the house walls, leaving one wall for piled firewood. The benches are five feet wide and about two and one-half feet high. Underneath them are stored baskets with dried foods, paddles, boxes of clothing and household effects. The benches are covered with rush mats which serve as beds.
The walls are also covered with rush mats. These reach from the roof to the floor, passing behind the benches.
When there is a severe storm, mats are hung at both sides of the door to keep the wind from blowing into the house. The floor is just the hard trodden ground which is occasionally sprinkled with sand.
The fires may be anywhere in the house. If there are only two, they are likely to be along the center under the ridgepole. Sometimes they are in the corners near the benches, especially when there are two or more families living in the house.
The house is owned by the person who builds it and is inherited by the eldest son of the owner. When the house is owned by two or more people, their parts are inherited in the same manner in which the whole house would be passed on.
The land on which a house stands belongs to the owner of the house only as long as his house remains standing.
Since villages situated on the beach are open to attack, stockades were frequently used in this area. The village was generally compact enough so that not a very large area needed to be surrounded.
