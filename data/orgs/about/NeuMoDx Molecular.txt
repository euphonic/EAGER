The NeuMoDxTM Molecular Systems are a family of scalable platforms that fully integrate the entire molecular diagnostic process from “sample to result”. The NeuMoDx 288 and the NeuMoDx 96 Molecular Systems are fully automated, continuous random-access analyzers that utilize our proprietary NeuDryTM reagent technology, which integrates magnetic particle affinity capture and real time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) chemistry in a multi-sample microfluidic cartridge. This technology, combined with a platform, uniquely incorporates robotics and microfluidics that result in higher throughput, improved performance and increased efficiency by eliminating the waste associated with technologies that required reconstitution of lyophilized reagents.
NeuMoDx has recently received FDA 510(k) clearance for its NeuMoDx GBS Assay for the detection of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) DNA in antepartum pregnant women and will continue development of tests to detect and monitor sexually transmitted and infectious diseases. Additionally, NeuMoDx offers a broad range of general purpose reagents and consumables for use by laboratorians in developing qualitative and quantitative Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs) for use with the NeuMoDx Molecular Systems to detect and amplify DNA and RNA targets.
