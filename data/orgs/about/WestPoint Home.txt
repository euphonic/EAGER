About Us
In 2013, WestPoint Home celebrated 200 years of its heritage as a home fashion pioneer. Our legacy can be traced to Stevens, established in 1813, with the manufacture of woolen broadcloth. Throughout the past 200 years, WestPoint Home and the companies that represent our heritage have been leaders in the innovation, sale and (of course) fashion of home textiles, experimenting with new fabrics to meet our customers’ ever-changing needs. Our legacy is simple: quality, affordable, and fashionable products for every customer. And we still lead the way.
WestPoint Home sells products under its own legendary brands including Vellux®, Martex®, Utica®, Luxor®, Patrician®, Grand Patrician®, and Modern Living®. WestPoint Home also manufactures and sells products with licensed brands which include Jill Rosenwald™, Collier Campbell™, Southern Tide®, Portico®, Under The Canopy®, and IZOD®. WestPoint Home boasts top retailers like Target, Bed Bath and Beyond, Macy’s, Dillard’s, Costco, Meijer, AAFES, TJ Maxx, HomeGoods, Marshalls, Ross Stores, Kohl’s, and JC Penney as customers.
