A Long History of Innovation and Commercial Deployment
﻿1984: First Ensyn company established by Dr Robert Graham and Barry Freel﻿
Concept developed by Dr. Robert Graham and Barry Freel while at the University of Western Ontario
Focus on fast thermal cracking of carbon-based feedstocks including biomass
Target was to obtain better yields of biocrude, higher quality products, lower costs
1985-1989: Proof of concept and commercialization
Strategic alliance established in mid-1980s with Red Arrow Products Company, a Wisconsin-based food products company
First commercial RTP facility delivered to Red Arrow in 1989
Since 1989, multiple RTP facilities have been delivered to Red Arrow for the production of food ingredients, with byproduct liquids used for industrial heating
Ensyn is responsible for overseeing operations and maintenance of the RTP facilities
Five commercial RTP units are currently operating at Red Arrow in Wisconsin
Red Arrow was purchased by the Kerry Group in 2015
1990-2000: scale-up of biomass RTP and development of petroleum application
RTP facilities scaled up to 30+ dry tons/day (60+ green tons/day) in the early 1990s
RTP technology adapted for heavy oil upgrading in 1998 – 20 barrel/day petroleum pilot facility
2000-2005: Development and sale of petroleum application
1,000 barrel/day heavy oil RTP unit designed and engineered by Ensyn and built in the Belridge oil field in California in 2004
Rights to the RTP technology for conversion of non-renewable feedstocks (including heavy oil upgrading) sold in 2005 at a US$100 million enterprise value
2005: Focus on renewable fuels
Following the sale of the non-renewable business, Ensyn returned its focus to the renewable fuels business 
First step was design and construction of Ensyn's 100%-owned, 70 dry tons/day  (140 green tons/day) RTP facility in Renfrew, Ontario (commissioned 2007)
The Ontario facility was originally commissioned as a commercial-scale merchant facility for the production of renewable chemicals and fuels
Ontario facility was enhanced in 2014 as Ensyn's first dedicated fuels facility
​2008: Landmark alliance with Honeywell UOP
In 2008 Ensyn and Honeywell UOP joined forces through the creation of Envergent Technologies LLC.
Envergent provides licensing, engineering services and RTP equipment supply to projects developed by Ensyn and its partners, with performance guarantees.
Ensyn’s alliance with Honeywell UOP was expanded in early 2014 to include cooperation between Honeywell UOP and Ensyn in developing and commercializing Refinery Co-processing.
2012: Ensyn establishes joint venture with Fibria Celulose, S.A., Brazil
Ensyn and Fibria establish an equally-owned joint venture for the development of facilities to produce biocrude in Brazil. The goal of the joint venture is to combine the strengths of each party to create a major biocrude production base in Brazil
​
Successful demonstrations of Refinery Co-processing in numerous trials and demonstrations, including in operating commercial refineries
Expanded alliance with Honeywell UOP to include commercialization of Refinery Co-processing
Developed delivery systems to integrate Ensyn's biocrude into FCC operations
Initiated and advanced commercial negotiations with refiners, feedstock providers and project lenders
10 million gallon/year biocrude production facility in Port Cartier, Quebec
50/50 Joint Venture between Ensyn and Arbec Forest Products
Financial support from leading Canadian Provincial and Federal funding agencies
Feedstock is slash and forest residues from local sources
Offtake is focusing initially on heating and cooling markets in the U.S. Northeast
