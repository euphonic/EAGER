We provide a full range of back-end testing services for high density memory, mixed-signal and flat panel display (FPD) driver semiconductors. In addition, we offer a comprehensive selection of leadframe-based and organic substrate-based package assembly services for memory, mixed-signal, and FPD driver semiconductors which are used in diverse end-use markets, including personal computers, communications equipment, office automation and consumer electronics. Our testing and packaging services are provided, pursuant to customer’s request, on a independent or  a turnkey basis.
With operations headquartered in Taiwan, the heart of the world’s technology value chain, most testing is currently conducted at our facility in the Hsinchu Science Park, while semiconductor packaging services are primarily conducted at our Southern Taiwan Science Park facility. We also provide gold bumping services at Chupei, Hsinchu. All of our facilities are state-of-the-art and reflect our long-standing commitment to our customers with the best technology and support services leading, innovative customers deserve.
In addition to our unique back-end solutions, we work in collaboration with our global client base to provide a complete range of vertically integrated solutions from package design through drop-shipment. This total solution capability is critical given compressed product lifecycles and the need for streamlined, efficient supply chain partners.
Close collaboration between our R&D teams and customers ensures technology roadmaps synchronized with production readiness of new test and package solutions for increasingly sophisticated semiconductor products. Growing with our customers leverages and expands our deployment of advanced engineering skills and capabilities for ongoing cost reductions, such as software conversion programs and parallel testing for client testing operations.If you continue reading, you are deemed to agree our Privacy Statement.
