Spotlight
“It's time to get the image of people in the late '90s frantically typing on their CrackBerries out of your head. That's BlackBerry's past. Software and services that BlackBerry makes for other companies is its future. And it looks like a bright one.” 
“The self-driving car — equipped with BlackBerry QNX software designed in Ottawa — is no mere hunk of metal. It’s the culmination of years of innovation and effort, a source of futuristic inspiration for Ottawa.”
BlackBerry is back – this time as a software company – and it’s focusing on growing its channel strategy as a way to strengthen its cyber security solutions.
