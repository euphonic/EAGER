Dolby transforms the science of sight and sound into spectacular experiences.
Through our innovative research and engineering, we develop breakthroughs that we share with the world through collaborations that span artists, businesses, and consumers worldwide.
Platform Brands
Dolby offers a number of technologies, including visual technologies, business voice technologies, and, of course, audio technologies. We have a set of platform brands that simplify and organize this broad portfolio of offerings around a set of consumer experiences. Appropriate platform brands associated with each technology are outlined in the Dolby Trademarks and Accompanying Statements section of the Professional Partner Guidelines.
Versions
Dolby logos must be displayed in a way that preserves their integrity. Do not warp, alter, or recolor the logo lockups or their components in any way. Always use artwork provided by Dolby.
Trademark Acknowledgment
A trademark acknowledgment statement as listed below shall be displayed whenever the Dolby logo or trademark is used in marketing materials.  The acknowledgment must be visible on the marketing material, typically in the form of a footnote, and identify only those Dolby logos and trademarks used. For example, if the Dolby Audio logo appears, use this statement:
Dolby, Dolby Audio, and the double-D symbol are trademarks of Dolby Laboratories.
