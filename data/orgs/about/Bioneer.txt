A leading biotech company / molecular biology company
Bioneer, an innovative biotech company since 1992


Bioneer Corporation is Korea’s leading biotech company. Bioneer was the first Korean biotechnology company when it was established in 1992. The company has developed state of art molecular biology products and technologies including oligonucleotides, thermostable polymerases, and instruments of gene manipulation (automatic nucleic acid extractor, thermal cycler, real-time qPCR instruments and DNA sequencer). From its inception, Bioneer has invested in the integration of recombinant DNA technology, fermentation, biochemistry and nucleic acid chemistry in addition to mechanics, photonics and electronics. The company is positioned to fully-integrate its capability to develop next generation technologies in the post-genome era through the invention of new biochemistry and instruments. Bioneer now runs two production and research facilities in Korea which are a total of 226,000 square feet. Equipped with proprietary 384 synthesizers, these facilities contain a full production line for oligonucleotide synthesis and siRNA products. In addition to DNA/RNA manufacturing, Bioneer makes novel molecular biology products and recombinant proteins including systems and reagents. 
After a successful Initial Public Offering a few years ago, Bioneer Corporation launched Bioneer Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary. The American subsidiary is located in Alameda, CA, in the heart of the San Francisco Bay Area. The company is devoted to providing state of art solutions to the global life science community in academia, biotech, clinical labs and pharmaceutical companies. We have expertise in a wide range of areas.
