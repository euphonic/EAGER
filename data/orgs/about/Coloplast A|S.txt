It all started back in 1954.
Nurse Elise Sørensen was concerned by the dramatic change in her sister’s lifestyle following an ostomy operation. Thora no longer dared to go out, fearing that her stoma would leak in public. Elise was determined to help her sister out of her isolation.
She came up with the idea of an ostomy bag with an adhesive ring, which would make it fit tightly to the skin. This would prevent leakage and give her sister – and thousands of people like her – the chance to return to their normal life.
Today, we're headquartered in Denmark and have locations in 40 different countries, but what unites us is our curiosity. We are guided by Elise's passion and commitment. Like her, we work closely with people who have intimate healthcare needs. We listen to their needs and respond with products and services that make their lives easier.

Coloplast 60th Anniversary!
Our Brand Story
The Coloplast story begins back in 1954. Elise Sørensen is a nurse. Her sister Thora has just had an ostomy operation and is afraid to go out in public, fearing that her stoma might leak. Listening to her sister’s problems, Elise conceives the idea of the world’s first adhesive ostomy bag.
Based on Elise’s idea, Aage Louis-Hansen, a civil engineer and plastics manufacturer, and his wife Johanne Louis-Hansen, a trained nurse, created the ostomy bag. An ostomy bag that helps Thora – and thousands of people like her – to live the life they want to lead.
A simple solution that makes a difference.
Today, our business includes Ostomy Care, Continence Care, Wound & Skin Care and Urology Care. We operate globally and employ about 11,000 employees.

What does this mean for our customers?
Closeness to all customers makes this possible. We listen to better understand needs, and respond by finding new ways to do things better together. We lead the way by bringing the best ideas first and fast to market in the form of medical devices and service solutions. 
Deeply private and personal medical conditions are our focus. Our passion to make a real difference to people’s lives is what drives and unites us. Our culture supports high ambitions, and releases the full potential of our own people to achieve them.
We welcome the broader responsibility that comes with leadership - a responsibility to the environment, to society, to our shareholders, and to act with integrity in all we do.
Coloplast develops products and services to make life easier for people with deeply personal and private medical conditions.
The more intimate the condition, the closer we work with our customers to find solutions that are sensitive to their needs. Closeness to all customers - end users as well as healthcare professionals - is our goal.
...and for us
Getting closer to our customers and understanding their needs is the guiding principle in everything we do. We all have a responsibility to listen and help respond to the needs of our customers.
But closeness also applies to our relationships with one another. We value open and honest dialogue so we can understand what motivates and drives us - both individually and as a company.
Through closeness, we can create a 'we' culture at Coloplast - where we listen to each other and do what we can to make our working lives easier.
What does this mean for our customers?
It's one of the most rewarding feelings - knowing you've made a real difference to another person’s quality of life. At Coloplast we share a passion to make this difference and we’re committed to achieving it. 
...and for us
Making a real difference to the lives of people who use our products is our greatest reward. We must be willing to go the extra distance. Our passion to make a difference unites us - and sets us apart from our competitors.
Passion drives us to find new ways to do things better. It inspires us to bring the best ideas rapidly to market. And we need passion to create a challenging, inspiring and enjoyable place to work.  
Respect and Responsibility
Respect for one another and the world around us will always be at the heart of Coloplast culture.
Our vision
Setting the global standard for listening and responding
Listening and responding has always been an integral part of what we do. We  have gained a great deal of knowledge through working with the people using our  products and healthcare professionals.
