Our Story
Founded in 2000, nLIGHT is a leader in the development, design and production of innovative laser technologies and products.
Our high-power semiconductor and fiber lasers are not only changing the way things are made but also changing the things that can be made. Strong vertical integration enables us to rapidly introduce new products for a range of markets including industrial, microfabrication, aerospace and defense.
nLIGHT’s semiconductor lasers are the industry’s brightest and operate at unique wavelengths and power combinations. Our high-power continuous wave fiber lasers provide significant advantages over legacy fiber lasers for programmability, serviceability and reliability. We engage with customers early in the design cycle and use a platform approach to product development to optimize semiconductor and fiber laser solutions to meet customer requirements.
