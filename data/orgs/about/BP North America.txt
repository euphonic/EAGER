BP’s history 
BP's commitment to the U.S. dates back 150 years through our heritage companies, Atlantic Refining and Richfield Petroleum. In the 1960s, the two companies merged, forming Atlantic Richfield or ARCO for short. That same decade, Standard Oil of Ohio (Sohio) and BP reached a deal that led to the first oil to flow from the North Slope of Alaska through the Trans-Alaska pipeline in 1977. Ten years later, BP acquired Sohio and made it the cornerstone of a new national operation, BP America. In 1998, Amoco and BP announced their merger, combining their worldwide operations into a single organization. Overnight, the new company became the largest producer of both oil and natural gas in the U.S. Fast-forward to today: BP is leading the way in helping to meet the energy needs both of America and the world.
Our values
We care deeply about how we deliver energy to the world. Above everything, that starts with safety and excellence in our operations. Our approach is built on respect, being consistent and having the courage to do the right thing.

We depend upon developing and deploying the best technology, and building long-lasting relationships. We are committed to making a real difference in providing the energy the world needs today, and in the changing world of tomorrow. We work as one team. We are BP.

For over 150 years, BP has supplied the energy fueling America’s growth. Today, our U.S. operations provide the investment, jobs and products underpinning both American prosperity and its transition to a lower-carbon future. 

In 2017, our businesses supported more than 125,000 U.S. jobs and contributed $85 billion to the U.S. economy. BP invests more in the United States than we do in any other country – $100+ billion between 2005 and 2017 – making us one of America’s top producers and refiners of oil and gas. With more than a dozen wind farms across eight states, BP is also one of the largest operators of renewable energy among our peers. And in 2017, a net wind portfolio the size of BP’s helped avoid around 2.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions.

BP's Economic Investment
Alaska
In the last two years, BP Alaska improved its operating efficiency to 85 percent – extracting the equivalent of a whole new oil field from existing wells in Prudhoe Bay.
Cooper River Chemicals
Our $200 million modernization project reduces energy consumption 40 percent, while slashing CO2 emissions up to 110,000 tons per year.
Texas City Chemicals
In 2017, this plant completed a major expansion, significantly improving its operational efficiency and increasing production of metaxylene by 10 percent.
BP-Husky Toledo Refinery: 
Since 2016, we’ve completed a massive maintenance and facility building project to improve safety and efficiency.
Gulf of Mexico Deepwater
Seismic processing and our Houston supercomputer identified an additional 1 billion barrels of oil accessible from our Gulf of Mexico hubs.
Whiting Refinery
Our waste heat recovery project generates steam from exhaust gas, recycling it into energy to run the refinery.  
Cherry Point Refinery
In 2018, this refinery launched a renewable diesel unit to co-process biomass alongside conventional feedstocks, producing ultra-low-sulfur diesel. 
Lower 48
Since 2000, BP’s Lower 48 business has slashed total greenhouse gas emissions by more than 2 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent.
Wind Energy
In 2018, BP partnered with Tesla to install a high-storage battery at its Titan 1 wind farm in South Dakota.

Spencer Dale, group chief economist, discusses the base case plus key themes and alternative scenarios in the BP Energy Outlook
To fuel America’s future, BP is focusing on high-value, high-quality projects that play to its distinctive strengths. These include exploration and discovery, deepwater, giant fields and gas supply chains and a high quality downstream business – all supported by leading-edge technology. In 2017, BP produced 712,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, making the company one of America’s largest oil and natural gas producers. BP also is one of the top refiners in the U.S., with the capacity to process 746,000 barrels of crude oil every day. More than 7,000 retail sites operate in the U.S. under a BP brand (BP, Amoco, ampm and ARCO), together representing 40 percent of the company’s global presence.

BP safely and responsibly provides the raw materials that power and heat homes, fuel the vehicles that keep the community moving and form the building blocks of everyday items ranging from paints and detergents to clothes and packaging.

Meet the men and women who continuously improve safety across BP’s operations.
DAVID McZEAL
From engineers to team leads to field techs, we’re always passing knowledge down the line. We share a common meeting table where we openly discuss the details of our daily events. These discussions allow us to see various ways to safely approach work scenarios. More than any job I’ve had in this industry, I feel incredibly safe knowing there’s always someone to go to for an answer, no matter the question. I’m proud to work for such a goal-driven company that’s as committed to safety as BP.
ELIZABETH CHIRAYIL
Safety at BP’s wind farms starts with observation. My team’s job is to be deeply aware of what’s happening in our surroundings. My team may not be climbing turbines, but we still have an intense obligation to foster BP’s safety culture. We want each employee to get home safe. Back to their families. Back to their lives. We want everyone to feel protected, because they are. It’s an attitude that affects you even if you’re not turning the crank.
JESSICA LAMBERT
As an engineer, I look at ways to build efficient systems. At BP, “efficient” always means “safe” first. I’m encouraged to look beyond the system to consider our colleagues who will actually carry out the job and think about the impact of the work on them. The workers are key to any system’s efficiency — so their safety needs to be paramount. I am not going to ask them to do anything I would not be willing to do myself. If it isn’t safe enough for me, it’s not efficient for anyone.
MAX DAVIES
An outsider to the industry may expect the emphasis on safety to be made along the front lines offshore. As a drilling engineer, I support rig site personnel from behind the scenes to deliver a safe and compliant operation. Even though I only visit the rigs a few times a year, I’m just as focused on safe operations as those on the platform.

The world is growing like never before, creating opportunity for billions of people. And all this growth requires energy. But as the world demands more energy it also demands that it be produced and delivered in new ways, with fewer emissions.

At BP, we embrace this dual challenge. We have always looked to the future, adapted to change and met challenges like this head on.
View the full report here
Making every type of energy cleaner and better
To deliver significantly lower emissions, we need to look at everything we do. A race to renewables will not be enough. That’s why we are making bold changes across our entire business.
Here’s how we are doing it: by reducing, improving, creating. We’re reducing emissions in our own operations; we’re improving our products to help customers lower their emissions; and we’re creating low carbon businesses.
&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt;Your browser does not support iframes.&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt;
Using natural gas to help power America
Natural gas is the fastest-growing hydrocarbon fuel and is going to be more important than ever as part of the energy mix. It’s an important back-up for wind and solar intermittency, and it burns 50% cleaner than coal in power generation.
Gas is a good thing when it is produced, distributed and consumed without reaching the atmosphere first. However, methane – the main component of natural gas – is 
understood to have a higher global warming potential than CO
2
 if it finds its way into the atmosphere before it’s burned.
Which is why we’re using innovative technologies to capture and reduce methane – like solar-powered pumps, infrared cameras and inspection drones. And why we’ve set a stringent and immediate 0.2% methane intensity target, which is 
supported by the Environmental Defense Fund
.
