It all began in 1911...
It was 1911 when a young entrepreneur named Joseph Eaton decided to invest in a new idea in transportation – the first gear-driven truck axle. And though we have grown considerably, both organically and by uniting some of the world's most respected names in our industry, we remain dedicated to the spirit of innovation and ideas that inspired him more than 100 years ago.
