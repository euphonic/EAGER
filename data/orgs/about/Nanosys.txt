Nanosys is leading the development of quantum dot technology for displays.
Nanosys is leading the development of quantum dot technology for displays. Since our founding in 2001, we have partnered with leading display makers in creating standout  tablets, TVs and smartphones that are thinner, lighter, brighter and more colorful than ever before. Our business model consists of two elements:
Sales of Quantum Dot Concentrate™ material
Technology licensing of component designs, like our Quantum Dot Enhancement Film (QDEF®), to industrial supply chain partners
While most of the innovative work we do can be measured in atomic units, the true impact of our technology advancements reach far beyond the beautiful and vibrant devices consumers hold in their hands. Nanosys has blazed a strategic path in quantum dot technology by developing one of the largest quantum dot patent portfolios with over 200 issued and pending patents worldwide. Our patents cover everything from the fundamentals of quantum dot construction to component and manufacturing designs. This extensive portfolio is the result of collaborations between Nanosys and prestigious universities such as Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Lawrence Berkeley National Labs and Hebrew University, as well as industry collaborations with companies like Philips-Lumileds and Life Technologies.
We’ve partnered with some of the biggest names in tablets and televisions to bring our technology to everyday consumers including 3M, Samsung, Sharp and LG. Working closely with these leading companies has given us insight into the tough engineering problems they face. At Nanosys we’re dedicated to generating value for both the manufacturing companies and the consumer. We understand that being a leader in quantum dots takes more than simply making the best quantum dot technology and scaling it -- it takes an understanding of how to easily incorporate this technology into manufacturing processes. The result is products that are practical, commercializable, cost effective and set a new standard in color performance.
Nanosys is headquartered in Milpitas, California, in a state-of-the-art 60,000 square foot manufacturing, research and development facility. One of the largest in the world, our site has an initial installed production capacity of over 25 tons of our Quantum Dot Concentrate™ or enough material for approximately 6 million 60" TVs per year.
QDEF®, Nanosys first major commercial product is shipping today in volume in consumer electronics devices and it’s just the beginning. We have many innovative quantum dot products in the pipeline for 2015 and beyond that will continue to drive Nanosys’ leadership position in the display industry. Stay tuned, we look forward to sharing them with you in the coming quarters.
Nanosys is proud to be backed by world renowned venture capital firms
