BCD (BIPOLAR-CMOS-DMOS) is a key technology for power ICs.  ST invented this technology—revolutionary at the time--in the mid-eighties and has continually developed it ever since. BCD is a family of silicon processes, each of which combines the strengths of three different process technologies onto a single chip: Bipolar for precise analog functions, CMOS (Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor) for digital design and DMOS (Double Diffused Metal Oxide Semiconductor) for power and high-voltage elements.
This combination of technologies brings many advantages: Improved reliability, reduced electromagnetic interference and smaller chip area. BCD has been widely adopted and continuously improved to address a broad range of products and applications in the fields of power management, analog data acquisition and power actuators.
Addressing a wide range of applications
With know-how in process development and chip production honed over more than two decades, ST offers a unique range of BCD process technologies, each addressing specific application needs, with an optimal trade-off between functionality, performance and cost.
The offer is divided into two types of BCD process:
High-voltage BCD, which enables reliable coexistence on the same chip of low-voltage control circuits and very high-voltage DMOS stages with typical voltage capability up to 800V. The integration of BCD on SOI (Silicon on Insulator) substrates addresses specific high-value applications in electromedical, automotive safety or audio.
High-density BCD is driven by the need to integrate more and more complex and diversified functions on the same chip and to guarantee high quality and reliability in all types of application environments.
Driving innovation in BCD
With its expertise in both “More-Moore” and “More-than-Moore” semiconductor technologies, ST has an unmatched capability to offer the best BCD solutions. By integrating DMOS architectures designed with a set of innovative techniques and taking advantage of state-of-the-art wafer-processing fabs, ST’s BCD offers best-in-class performance and the most advanced process nodes.
Moreover, ST has the capability to customize its BCD technologies to optimally address the most demanding markets, including automotive, aerospace and certain segments of the industrial market. By taking into account all of the specificities of the targeted application from the earliest development stages ST can offer tailor-made solutions to its customers
Capitalizing on the strong synergy between technology, design and application, ST has also developed a rich set of development tools to aid in the design process for customers, allowing fast introduction of powerful and robust products to the market.
With its unique technical knowledge based on more than two decades of experience in the field, ST provides unrivaled technical support in order to guarantee the best BCD experience to its customers.

About ST
Innovation & Technology
SiC
SiC
Silicon Carbide
Silicon Carbide (SiC)
 is a wide bandgap material. Wide bandgap technologies have many advantages compared to Silicon. Operating temperatures are higher, heat dissipation is improved and switching and conduction losses are lower. However, wide bandgap materials are more difficult to mass produce compared to silicon based ones.
Silicon Carbide properties
The Silicon Carbide Advantages
Higher Performance & Voltage Operation
Extremely low power losses
Intrinsic SiC body diode (MOSFET) (4 quadrant operation)
Faster and more robust than silicon
Smaller Die Size for equivalent breakdown voltage
More Energy Efficient
High thermal conductivity
Higher Operating Frequency
Lower switching losses, excellent diode switching performance
Smaller, Lighter Systems
Higher Operating Temperature
Operating up to 200°C junction
Reduces Cooling requirements and hence allows for lighter systems with increased lifetime
Easy to Drive
Fully compatible with standard Gate Drivers
Simpler design
ST and Silicon Carbide
ST has been working with Silicon Carbide since 1996. Introducing a new technology in a semiconductor market demanding high quality, long lifecycles at competitive costs is demanding. ST overcame the challenges of the industrialization of this wide bandgap material and started to produce its first 
SiC diodes
 in 2004. In 2009 ST started to produce its first 
SiC MOSFETs
 and since then we have added 1200V versions of both SiC MOSFETs and power Schottky diodes to complement the original 650V versions.
The supply chain for SiC is becoming more robust, the cost of the basic material is decreasing as supplier competition increases. ST has worked hard on the quality of the material and process improvement. As the material and the 
products based upon SiC technology
 became more robust ST created automotive-grade SiC power devices that are becoming a key enabler in vehicle electrification.
ST’s 6” SiC wafer production started in 2017, with the ramp-up of production helping to drive down costs and increase supply for the ever increasing list of SiC applications, including more solar inverters, industrial motor drives, home appliances, and power adapters.
