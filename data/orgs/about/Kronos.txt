    "transcript": "If we can recruit great people and we can retain great people we're going to produce better products and deliver better services which is going to have a direct impact on our customers. The old software days of buying a piece of software and install it on your computer and maintaining it yourself. Those days are gone. Now the solution is in the cloud. It's not just \"Here is the software and go off with it\". We deliver our software and we deliver the service with it. They're with us basically forever.  If we're going to enter into long-term relationship like that you need to make sure that not only the products are great but the people are great too. It's not just buying the product. You're buying the services and that us. They are buying 4,000 employees that we have behind them. It's all about the relationship. Who you want to work with and why do you want to work with them. Are they hiring the right people? Are they doing the right things in the community? Are their employees happy? You want those people to be competent, knowledgeable and dedicated to the customers. I really, really enjoy working with my customers. I'm there to help them make their lives easier. We talk to you. We teach you. We give you that confidence. We encourage you. We end up becoming friends with customers as well so we want to support them as best as we can. It's a partnership that's not quite a family bond. I don't want to get too cheesy but it's close. When Kronos hires, they think about the people they're putting in place and how we'll work as a team. We all share very similar characteristics. People that are happy to be here. Positivity breeds positivity. It's so  comfortable and it's easy to get along with friendly people who want to work. The people here, they're not just coworkers. I truly care about the people that I work with. We have like this little family ambiance that I really enjoy. We're friends. We hang out in work, outside of work. The friendships I've made at Kronos make it so special. We get to learn so much. We get to interact with so many people who are really skilled. We really look for the best. Across-the-board they're they're very bright individuals. People with a bit of imagination. We're part of something bigger than just what we do. It makes me feel excited to work on things that are new in my field. So thankfully that you want to actually do something that's gonna have an impact. It comes back to that passion thing. That the product itself is a really good product. It's amazing when you see how many people actually use Kronos. It's impacting quite about 40 million users. We cannot deliver great service without having great people. So we're a better partner to our customers because we have great people here. I originally picked Kronos because of the reviews that they had on Glassdoor. The feedback that Kronos is getting is fantastic. I feel valued as an employee. If you have great work the company's a success. We don't care just about your work life, we care about the whole person. And managers know that if they don't take care of their employees, they're gonna have to answer to a CEO who does. I'm actually one of those boomerang employees. I came back to Kronos. When you've seen other companies you really see the difference. People just love being here. I just feel really happy and really fulfilled. When a company treats your employees well, it will attract a better quality of person. People that will go the extra mile. Really good people have choices where they can work. We work hard to have them feel like this is the place they want to be part of. As a customer you want to interact with somebody who's going to listen to you. Who's smart? Who's going to find solutions for you, right? By getting the best on it.  That's what we're providing. When you call Kronos,  you're going to meet with people that are invested in your success. I'm going to stay as long as I need to ensure that I get it done. You're not going to get left hanging. Not on my watch. It makes you proud to see the amount of effort that we put just to make sure that we get something of a higher-quality. It's one of the best decisions to take this role that I've ever made and I can't wait to see what more Kronos has to offer me. I have added to Kronos but Kronos has added a lot to me. So I I see myself like a better person that I work at a company like this."

The Early Years
1977 – 1986
It started with a simple idea from Mark S. Ain: there had to be an easier way to record employee time transactions. With a team of engineers and a hunger for success, his idea came to life with the first patented microprocessor-based time clock. The time clock automatically recorded, totaled, and reported employee hours, transforming an industry that had not seen innovation in many years.
1977 – Kronos Incorporated founded by MIT alum Mark Ain
1979 – Delivered industry’s first microprocessor-based time clock
1983 – Relocated corporate headquarters to Waltham, Mass.
1985 – Introduced PC-based product, Timekeeper Central
1986 – Established presence in Canada
1987 – 1996
In the late 80's, we completed the first of many dealer acquisitions as the company focused on transitioning to a direct sales channel. With strong success in North America, we began to expand internationally.
