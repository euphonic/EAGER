We are                         courageous in both decision and action. And we believe that good business means a better                         world.

Our Values
The three Roche values—Integrity, Courage, and Passion—are core to how we want to                         behave, as individuals and collectively as an organization.
Passion means we use our drive and commitment to energize, engage and                             inspire others.
Courage means we are entrepreneurial and thus take risks, reach beyond                             boundaries and experiment.
Integrity means we are consistently open, honest, ethical and genuine.
These values define fundamental attributes for guiding decisions and actions leading to increased                         innovation and business performance.

Perkin Medal
2013
In June 2013, Bruce Roth, senior vice president, Small Molecule Drug Discovery was awarded the 2013 SCI Perkin Medal for his innovation in applied chemistry resulting in outstanding commercial development.
The SCI Perkin Medal is recognized as the highest honor given for outstanding work in applied chemistry in the United States. It commemorates the discovery of the first synthetic dye (the so-called Perkin mauve) by Sir William Henry Perkin in 1856. This discovery was a significant step forward in organic chemistry that led to the birth of a major segment of the chemical industry. The SCI Perkin Medal was first awarded to Sir William at a banquet held by the SCI in New York in 1906. Since then, more than 100 such awards have been given to notable scientists.
Our co-founder, Herb Boyer received the 2007 Perkin Medal for his work on recombinant DNA.
