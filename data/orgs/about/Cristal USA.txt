About Cristal
By increasing our global presence, staying in the forefront of new titanium technologies,             protecting the environment, and giving back to the communities where we work, Cristal strives to be a model corporate citizen and a name synonymous with the benefits             of titanium products.
In May 2007, Cristal acquired Millennium Inorganic Chemicals, combining the two             companies’ diverse manufacturing platforms to become one unified global producer.             The acquisition propelled Cristal to be the world's second largest producer             of titanium dioxide (TiO2).
Cristal now directs the operation of eight TiO2 manufacturing             plants on five continents, with locations in Ashtabula, Ohio; Baltimore, Maryland;             Salvador, Bahia; Stallingborough, UK; Thann, France; Yanbu, Saudi Arabia; Bunbury,             Australia; and a mine site in Paraiba, Brazil.
Strengthening the Titanium Value Chain
In 2008, Cristal further expanded its titanium value chain through the acquisitions             of Bemax and International Titanium Powder. Now known as Cristal Mining , it is one of Australia’s premier mineral sands companies and is headquartered in Perth,             Western Australia. Cristal Mining is the largest producer of leucoxene, the sixth largest             producer of rutile and the seventh largest producer of zircon globally. 
ITP International Titanium Provider (ITP) was formed in 1997, now known as Cristal Metals , it was formed in 1997, now  to develop and commercialize Armstrong Process™             patented and proprietary technology to produce high-purity metal and alloy powders             with specific emphasis on titanium.
