Mark Goldman, Founder & CEo
With the help of some of Silicon Valley's finest sales strategists, product designers and materials and manufacturing experts, Mark founded Armageddon to help deliver on the full promise of solar, by developing products that fit the needs of the industry's most demanding customers, in particular mainstream consumer rooftops and remote microgrids.
Prior to Armageddon, Mark helped launch pioneering commercial solar finance provider Tioga Energy.  He also founded EtherSea Communications, a centralized text and voice messaging service provider, and PITO Networks, one of the earliest free file storage and sharing companies.
Early in his career, Mark had the great fortune of working in the Administration of President George H.W. Bush, serving in the White House Office of Cabinet Affairs, focusing on energy and security issues as a junior staffer, and at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, where he worked in the Administratorâ€™s Office on special initiatives such as the launch of the Energy Star program and cap and trade for acid rain reduction.
