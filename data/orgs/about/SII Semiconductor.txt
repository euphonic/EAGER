Inheriting the Seiko Instruments Inc. semiconductor business and continuing to evolve, ABLIC Inc. is a maker of analog semiconductors.
HOME
Corporate Profile
ABLIC is a coined word combining ABLE (possible) and IC (short for “integrated circuit”), expressing that semiconductor technology enables possibilities.
Our logo consists of an upwards arrow, representing growth, combined with a diamond (◆), representing integrated circuits, which together form an “A”, the first letter of the company name. This, as a whole, expresses our corporate vision of striving to help society grow through semiconductor technology.

HOME
Corporate Profile
Vision
SMALL
Developing and manufacturing 
ultra-small semiconductor products
SMART
Providing power-saving analog 
semiconductors leading to a “smart” society
SIMPLE
Providing simple, easy-to-use products 
contributing to miniaturization and cost reduction
The origin of our products lies in the development of CMOS ICs for quartz watches. We downsized quartz mechanisms from the size of a locker to something small enough to be worn on a wrist, and succeeded in bringing to production analog semiconductors that function accurately while using only a minute amount of energy. The safe and reliable leading-edge technology cultivated through our research and manufacturing is seeing increasing utilization in the latest key devices, including those for automobiles, smartphones, and healthcare.
