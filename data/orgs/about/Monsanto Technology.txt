Monsanto History
An Introduction
The history of today’s Monsanto, an agricultural company, began in 2002 after it was divested from Pharmacia Corporation. Agricultural biotechnology was firmly established as the new company’s strategic research focus in an effort to improve farmer livelihoods by increasing their profitability through yield enhancements.

The Billionth Acre
In 2005, the industry reached a milestone: the billionth acre of biotech crops was planted. We continued to innovate and release second- and third-generation and stacked seed products, adding value to farming operations around the world.
Soon after, Monsanto joined the Chicago Climate Exchange® (CCX), North America’s only voluntary and legally binding greenhouse gas emissions reduction, registry, and trading program. Monsanto agreed to reduce our carbon emissions and promised to work with farmer groups, educating them on how to reduce emissions by practicing no-till agriculture.

A More Sustainable Future
In 2008, we shifted our focus to full-spectrum sustainable farming solutions. We pledged to:
Help farmers double yields in corn, soybeans, and cotton by 2030;
Develop seeds that will reduce by one-third per unit produced the aggregate amount of key resources, such as land, water, and energy, required to grow crops by 2030;
Improve the lives of farmers, including an additional five million people in resource-poor farm families, by 2020.
A key turning point in Monsanto’s history occurred in 2012, as we started acquiring companies producing digital tools and data modeling to provide even more precision-focused solutions for farmers. We established technology and learning centers throughout the U.S. to help the industry understand more about the planet that feeds us. We continue to institute outreach programs with the goal of improving the lives of families and communities around the world, including in our hometown of St. Louis, Missouri.
In 2016, Monsanto’s board of directors voted to approve an acquisition by Bayer CropScience AG, a key development in the refinement of our strategic focus. In 2017 and the coming years, our goal is to move agriculture forward by using less of our natural resources.

A New Strategic Direction Under the Same Name
The name “Monsanto” has actually been around since 1901 when John F. Queeny founded a company that could produce saccharine at one-sixth the cost of sugar. He named the company after his wife, Olga Monsanto Queeny.
In the 1940s, John’s son Edward Queeny saw an opportunity to enter the agriculture industry. The first agricultural product introduced by this Monsanto was an insecticide called Santobane. The company soon expanded to provide fertilizer for farmers as well, though the current Monsanto no longer sells this product.
As a result of the chemist John Franz’s discovery of a molecule that was developed into the product called glyphosate, in the 1970s the first Roundup® branded herbicide made its debut. In 1983, scientists succeeded in modifying a plant cell through biotechnology for the first time, which led to field trials of the first genetically modified crops in 1987. This breakthrough laid the foundation for today’s Monsanto Company, whose goal is to deliver products that help farmers grow food sustainably.
