Our Portfolio Companies
GTI International, Inc. (GTII) is a holding company and wholly owned subsidiary of GTI. Through GTII, GTI is investing in an efficient, clean energy future to meet ever-escalating energy, operational, and environmental challenges.
We combine capital, technical expertise, infrastructure, and access to GTI’s global network of partners and customers, advanced laboratories, unrivaled training, and resources to help companies expand and grow.
On January 1, 2017, GTI International, Inc. (GTII) subsidiaries Fisher-Nickel, Inc., Davis Energy Group, Inc., and Bevilacqua-Knight, Inc. (BKi) combined to become a new company, Frontier Energy, Inc. On January 1, 2018, CDH Energy and Frontier Associates joined the company.
Spin-Offs
LocusView Solutions (LVS) was launched as a Chicago start-up in 2014 by GTI International (GTII). The company has intimate knowledge of the industry’s unique engineering, operational, and regulatory compliance needs and brings advanced commercial-scale mobile geospatial products and services to natural gas operators, leveraging technology developed with industry support.
In April 2018, LVS was sold to NortecView, Ltd., a software company that develops innovative cross-platform mobile, IoT, and web solutions for utility companies. The long-standing partner developed the mobile application platform currently utilized by LocusView. Together, the team will be well positioned to accelerate the pace of product development and rapidly scale deployment of the technology throughout the U.S.
In 2013, GTI helped launch a consulting firm, Enovation Partners, focused exclusively on serving the energy and infrastructure sectors. GTI supports Enovation Partners with technical knowledge and experience as it helps U.S. and multinational clients develop high-impact strategies, evaluate new technologies, assess the regulatory landscape, and navigate the business environment of a rapidly changing market.

Community Service
GTI works to make a difference in our local community, helping others that are nearest to us. These activities are a reflection of our culture, our values, and the way we do business.
Annual Food Drives. GTI hosts a food drive several times a year to help stock the local food pantry, the Self-Help Closet & Pantry of Des Plaines. The Pantry distributes food to over 1,000 individuals and families every month, feeding the area’s hungry children, elderly, working poor, unemployed, chronically ill, and homeless.
“Toys for Tots” Campaign. GTI participates in a U.S. Marine Corps sponsored program, providing gifts to disadvantaged children throughout metropolitan Chicago.
United Way Campaign. Through an annual payroll deduction campaign, we provide financial support to a national organization that creates a brighter future or those in need.
LifeSource. Each year we sponsor several onsite blood drives at our headquarters.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. Corporate Challenge. GTI employees take part in the annual 3.5 mile Chicago race that benefits local not-for-profit organizations.
Veterans Day Service Project. Throughout the year, GTI employees collect personal-sized items such as shampoos and soap. In October, GTI hosts a service project to assemble the toiletries into basic supply kits that are delivered to needy veterans at the Jesse Brown VA Center in Chicago on Veteran’s Day. Each kit is accompanied with a special note of appreciation for their service to our country.
Environmental Sustainability
As a leading energy research institution, GTI believes everyone has a key role in protecting the integrity of our planet for future generations. From the projects we choose to the way we run our operations, we are committed to reducing our own environ­mental footprint.
Creating a Sustainability Management Plan. A three-year strategic plan developed by GTI’s Environmental Sustainability Committee outlines our intention and goals.
Reducing our own non-project related energy use. An Energy Use Analysis is establishing a baseline to deter­mine the impact of our facility updates. We are replacing lights and were able to decommission many of our laboratory hoods to save energy. All outdoor lights were replaced with LED lighting that is up to 80% more efficient than traditional lighting. During renovations, low-flow automatic flush toilets were installed to conserve natural resources. They save three gallons per flush and reduce overall water use by over 200,000 gallons of water/year.
Managing material re-use, recycling, and disposal. All printers are set to print double sided to reduce paper use. Excess colored paper was donated to a program at an alternative high school in Chicago that uses art as a teaching tool for underserved students.

History
GTI celebrated our 75th anniversary in 2016. As a leading research, development, and training organization addressing global energy and environmental challenges, GTI has spent the last seven+ decades developing high-impact technologies and providing technical insight to unlock the potential of natural gas and other energy resources—making them economically and environmentally sustainable while reducing energy costs for consumers.
The organization has achieved many successes over our prolific history, focusing on initiatives aligned with important national priorities. GTI has provided innovative solutions to critical challenges along the entire gas value chain, and improved the ways of producing, transporting, and using energy to benefit the general public.
Gas Technology Institute (GTI) was formed in April 2000 by the combination of two major research and technology development organizations serving the natural gas industry—Gas Research Institute (GRI) and the Institute of Gas Technology (IGT).
GRI was founded in 1976 in response to the Federal Power Commission (FPC) encouraging increased gas research and development (R&D). GRI administered research funding provided by a surcharge on shipments of natural gas sold by the interstate pipelines. At its peak in 1994, GRI administered funds in excess of $212 million.
IGT, founded in 1941, supported the gas industry need to train graduate engineers. IGT was affiliated with the Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) as a degree-granting institution from 1941 to 1994, when IGT moved off IIT’s campus to larger facilities in Des Plaines, IL.
As the gas industry evolved, IGT also evolved in parallel and focused on a world-renowned research program with support from many industry sources, including GRI.
As a result of the phasing out of GRI’s funding mechanism, the gas industry encouraged GRI and IGT to combine activities. In 2000, the GRI/IGT combination became official and today, GTI offers the strengths of both predecessors, positioned as a leading research, development and training organization serving the global natural gas industry and energy markets.
