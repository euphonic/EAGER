About FIATest
FIATest delivers a fast, reliable and accurate testing for Food Intolerance and Allergy in a way never done before. Traditionally and as it still is, an appointment is necessary to consult a medical specialist and obtain the prescription for laboratory tests for food intolerances and allergies. Blood is drawn and a specimen is sent to a laboratory for diagnosis.
At times, Laboratories are in separate locations that require another drive or commute. Traditional testing for Allergies requires injecting a vast array of allergens into a patient’s skin to be observed for reactions.The procedure not only hurts but the reaction from the different allergens injected into the body could cause discomforts.
Cutting to the chase, this tedious and very expensive process is over! Here comes FIATest – the latest innovation in Food Intolerance and Allergy Testing. Food Intolerance and/or Allergy Test can be ordered online or as distribution locations are established, they will soon be available in pharmacies, clinics, and other outlets. With an online order, a blood collection kit is delivered to any location and customers can draw their own blood specimen in the comfort of their home. The kit is then mailed out or dropped off to specified locations. Results will be delivered electronically or by mail or courier.
This process takes an estimated 3-7 days depending on location. The test results come in the form of an easily readable report of all the food intolerances and allergies. The results could be for personal guidance of customers on their diet, or it could be brought to a specialist for explanations on the patient’s wellness program. For Food Intolerance Testing, FIATest profiles IgG to measure long-term dietary responses to foods. The advanced microarray immunoassay testing format is used for added precision.
For Allergies, FIATest reports total IgE and a large panel of food and environmental allergens including molds and fungi, tree pollens, grasses, animals and insects, weed pollens, fruits and vegetables, grains, nuts and seeds proteins, insect stings, among many others. Multiplexed immunoassays provide enhance accuracy, precision and processing speed. Allergy tests assist doctors in identifying and treating asthma and allergies, as well as in recommending immunotherapies. FIATest Allergy test serves the general public including pediatric patients, seniors, immunotherapy patients and those with special needs.
FIATest is made available to the general public by True-Safe Brands, Inc. in exclusive collaboration with a CLIA-certified Laboratory based in the State of California, U.S.A.
The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) are federal regulations for United States-based clinical laboratories to provide industry standards for testing of human samples for diagnostic purposes. These amendments were added to the laboratory requirements outlined in the Code of Federal Regulations, 42 CFR 493. Three federal agencies are responsible for ensuring compliance of laboratories to CLIA: the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Center for Disease Control (CDC). Having a CLIA certificate demonstrates that Laboratories meet the federal regulations for clinical diagnostic testing, ensuring quality and safety in the laboratory and with laboratory results.”
