To increase the efficiency of the transportation industry while reducing its carbon footprint through the application of solar power.
Our Vision
Green Solar Transportation's revolutionary applications of the latest in solar technology offer cost effective and environmentally friendly solutions to a number of energy related problems faced by the transportation industry today. Our environmental awareness and passion for the transportation industry have led us to design a line of products that can reduce fuel costs for businesses while minimizing environmental impact and reliance on foreign energy sources. In 2008 Green Solar Transportation began creating some of the world's first photovoltaic energy systems to be utilized for commercial transportation.  With several patent-pending methods, GST's impact on both the environment and the transportation industry will be exponentially prevalent in the years to come.
