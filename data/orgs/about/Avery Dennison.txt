Our Company
Materials science is in our DNA.
The pursuit of our vision has compelled us to align our businesses into a focused, customer-driven company that specializes in materials science. Our in-depth pool of expertise and global scale enable us to deliver insights, innovative products and intelligent solutions to customers all over the world.
Heritage
The Avery Dennison story begins in 1935, with just a few spare parts, one very bright idea and a $100 loan. Ray Stanton (“Stan”) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry. With a few simple materials—primarily used machine parts and a saber saw—Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Avery Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information. In 1990, Avery International merged with Dennison Manufacturing to become Avery Dennison. Today, we manufacture and distribute labeling and packaging materials in over 50 countries and employ more than 30,000 people. The flexibility and responsiveness afforded by our company's global footprint enables us to service our customers at key points throughout their supply chain. In just over 80 years we have grown from one bright idea into a global corporation that continues to set new standards for quality and innovation in materials science.
What We Do
Avery Dennison manufactures and distributes display graphics, labeling and packaging materials, retail graphic embellishments and RFID tags that companies around the world use to engage customers and efficiently manage their inventories. Our products are virtually everywhere you look, providing a crucial thread in the fabric of global commerce.

We sustain Stan Avery's spirit of curiosity through research, invention and development of new materials science products and processes. Our expertise in high-speed manufacturing, information display and management, logistics, branding, graphics and packaging enables us to impact a wide array of markets—from consumer packaged goods and apparel to transportation, architecture and healthcare.
Global Markets
Avery Dennison's extensive experience in our core businesses allows us to purchase, process, and deliver needed materials to key points in our customers' supply chains with rapid and globally consistent execution. 

We now employ approximately 30,000 employees in more than 50 countries with reported sales in 2017 of $6.6 billion.

Helping communities where Avery Dennison employees live and work.
The Avery Dennison Foundation advances the causes of education, sustainability and women’s empowerment in the communities where Avery Dennison employees live and work and encourages employee engagement with a spirit of invention and innovation, improving the quality of life for the people in their communities.
Education
Grantmaking in education provides funding for educational improvements to elementary, secondary, post-secondary and/or vocational schools; and focuses on STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) or graphic and visual arts educational efforts. These grants direct services to populations who are traditionally underserved because of gender, socioeconomic status or geography.
InvEnt- Spirit of Invention
The goal of the Avery Dennison InvEnt Scholarship Program is to recognize and reward invention,innovation and excellence in high‐achieving students studying in the fields of science, engineering and technology at selected higher education institutions in China and India. The Avery Dennison Foundation developed the program to encourage students to continue to pursue educational opportunities in these fields after graduation by helping them meet their financial needs during their university attendance, and also by offering training opportunities and engagement with Avery Dennison corporate offices. Overall, the program aims to foster the development of talent and human resources, nurture creativity and inspire young people in China and India to engage in the spirit of invention.
Avery Dennison U.S. Scholars Program
The Scholars Program recognizes the academic achievements and potential of the sons and daughters of company employees and helps them obtain a college education. Since its inception in 1977, the program has supported more than 550 students across the United States in their pursuit of higher education. This scholarship program is administered by Scholarship Management Services, a department of Scholarship America. Sending a child off to college is one of the great moments of a parent’s life, and the Avery Dennison Foundation is proud to support such moments.
Sustainability
Grantmaking in sustainability provides direct support for projects that conserve the natural environment and contribute to the social, environmental and economic well-being of communities.
The Rainforest Alliance
The Avery Dennison Foundation announced a $600,000 grant to the  Rainforest Alliance  to foster best practices in forestry management, create jobs and increase access to sustainably-managed forest products in Honduras. The Rainforest Alliance works to curb deforestation in Honduras and throughout the world by providing farmers and forest managers with sustainable alternatives to forest destruction.
Women's Empowerment
Grantmaking in women’s empowerment provides direct support for projects that address gender equality, equity and opportunities in Avery Dennison communities.
Business for Social Responsibility
The Avery Dennison Foundation has supported Business for Social Responsibility’s HERHealth initiative in India to empower low-income women working in global supply chains through workplace-based programs.
World Memon Organization
The Avery Dennison Foundation has supported the World Memon Organization’s Pakistan Chapter to purchase equipment and train women in sewing and embroidery at the commercial and domestic level to earn income.
Apply for a Grant
The Avery Dennison Foundation supports non-profit and non-governmental organizations in markets where our employees live and work. Regardless of geography, all the grants we award will extend our strategic giving in support of education, sustainability and women’s empowerment. The Foundation accepts grant requests year round and makes funding decisions on a quarterly basis.
Employees in the Community
Avery Dennison employees around the world volunteer their time and talents to address social and material needs in their communities.
Community Investment Teams (CITs) are groups of Avery Dennison employees with the interest in making a positive difference in our local community. We have over 50 CITs globally, made up of employee volunteers who facilitate engagement and volunteerism to help improve the communities surrounding our facilities.
Encouraging community involvement. Inspiring human promise. The Model Integrity and Social Responsibility Leadership Excellence Award was created by the Avery Dennison Foundation to recognize and encourage volunteer community service by Avery Dennison employees worldwide. This award was created in honor of former Avery Dennison Chairman, President and CEO, H. Russell Smith, who was actively committed to community service. By advancing Avery Dennison's values and leadership principles, the recipients of this award exemplify the Foundation's vision of inspiring human promise to create a more intelligent and sustainable world.
Global Grant Spotlight: Project Hope Schools
The Avery Dennison Foundation works in cooperation with  The China Youth Development Foundation’s  Project Hope Initiative to fund and support education in poverty stricken areas of China. Currently, we support/fund 3 schools throughout China.  We share China Youth Development Foundation’s belief that supporting rural children’s access to quality elementary education will positively impact not only their lives, but also the entire community. Rebuilding rural schools represents a meaningful contribution that our company and employees make in China.
Alicia Procello
Welcome to the the Avery Dennison Foundation.
Carrying on the spirit of community established by Avery Dennison founder Stan Avery, the Avery Dennison Foundation represents the values of Avery Dennison employees around the world. We focus our giving mainly on education, environmental sustainability, and women’s empowerment.
Our giving touches people across the globe. In my travels for the Foundation, I have seen the power of our grantmaking in the faces of children in rural China as they celebrated the opening of a new school; in the hard work and tenacity of communities producing sustainable wood products in remote Honduras; and in the clever inventions designed by future engineers in India.
