We are Red Hat
Our mission is to be the catalyst in communities of customers, contributors, and partners creating better technology the open source way.
Who we are
The world's leading provider of open source, enterprise IT solutions
More than 2 decades ago, Red Hat had a spark of an idea—a vision for developing software differently. We believed that collaboration with an ecosystem of IT leaders, open source advocates, developers, and partners could create a better foundation for the future of IT—Red Hat® Enterprise Linux®.
But that was just the beginning.
Today, we deliver a comprehensive portfolio of products and services using the same open, collaborative business model and an affordable, predictable subscription.

This year marks Red Hat's 25th anniversary
To our courageous supporters across the globe—thank YOU for believing in the power of collaboration.
Leadership
Leading our team the open source way
The most respected and influential people at Red Hat are those who show passion for our mission and live it every day. A leader at Red Hat does not rely on their title to earn respect.
Jim Whitehurst, President and chief executive officer, Red Hat
Bringing open source to the enterprise
Open source communities are solving some of the most complex business and IT challenges today. The freedom to see the code, ask questions, and offer improvements back to the community: this is the open source way.
Participate
Integrate
Stabilize
We commercialize these platforms together with a rich ecosystem of services and certifications.
A better way to buy and sell software
A Red Hat subscription is more than the software. Red Hat customers get the latest software, trust that it's secure, and gain access to a community of experts making software the open source way.
Trust Red Hat

Diverse voices for the future of IT
We believe that the future of IT needs diverse voices and perspectives, so we're working to inspire the next generation to join the open source movement.
Women making an impact
Red Hat is an advocate for diversity in open source. We created and sponsor the Women in Open Source Award to recognize women who make an impact and encourage future generations to join the open source movement.
Red Hat promotes open source software, methodology, and culture in education.
It's not just about technology. It's about people.
We've been at the forefront of open source for more than 20 years. But it's not just about technology. Open source values like meritocracy, community building, and transparency are changing the way we approach business and life. See why openness is the default 21st-century innovation model.
Life
Openness is a catalyst for change. Whether it's healthcare or education, open source principles are changing the way we live.
Business
From DevOps to containers, the future of IT needs all of us. These are some of the big ideas Red Hat is thinking about.
Successful organizations need open leadership. Jim Whitehurst, CEO of Red Hat, explains how open organizations can encourage the best ideas.
We’re the world’s leading provider of enterprise open source solutions, using a community-powered approach to deliver high-performing Linux, cloud, container, and Kubernetes technologies.

How We Disclose Your Personal Data
Red Hat will not sell, rent or lease your Personal Data to others without your consent.
Red Hat discloses Personal Data in the following ways:
Red Hat may disclose personal data to business partners and service providers in order to support our business operations, such as (but not limited to) fulfilling your orders, following up on requests, providing support and assisting Red Hat with sales, marketing and communication initiatives. These business partners and service providers include distributors, resellers, payment processors, financial service providers and institutions, materials production and shipping companies, postal or government authorities, market intelligence and consulting service providers, and information technology service providers. Business partners and service providers are required by contract to keep the information received on behalf of Red Hat confidential and secure and not use it for any purpose other than the purpose for which it was provided to them.
Red Hat may disclose personal data as required by law or legal process, such as responding to a duly authorized and lawful request of a police or public authority (including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements), to enforce or protect the rights of Red Hat, when such disclosure is necessary or appropriate to prevent physical harm or financial loss as permitted by applicable law, or in connection with an investigation of suspected or actual illegal activity.
Red Hat may also disclose personal data in the context of a business transaction involving part or all of Red Hat, such as a merger, acquisition, consolidation, or divestiture. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal data to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of it from sellers. It is Red Hat’s practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions. Following such a business transaction, you may contact the entity to which we transferred your personal data with any inquiries concerning the use of that information.
