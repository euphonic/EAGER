Copyright© 2018 Seiko Epson Corporation. All rights reserved.I Want Epson to Genuinely Contribute to Society with the World's Most Advanced Technology
Minoru Usui, President
Technological aspirations are embedded in Epson's DNA
Since its founding, Epson has always sought to create value where none previously existed by pursuing technological innovation.
We created the world's first compact, lightweight digital printer, the world's first quartz watch, and the world's first photo-quality inkjet printer, whose successors are a cornerstone of the Epson of today. The technology behind these products did not exist before they were developed.
Each of these products was developed from the ground up by Epson engineers who aspired to bring certain value to the world or to create products that would benefit people's lifestyles. Over the years, this approach has become deeply embedded in Epson's DNA.
We have found that we have greater insights and a clearer overall picture of the technologies that we worked so hard to develop and advance. And this, in turn, allows us to maximize the potential of these technologies.
Vertical Integration
Creating value that exceeds customer expectations
I believe that Epson's strength derives from a vertically integrated business model, wherein we personally develop, manufacture, and sell products that are based on core technologies and core devices that we ourselves have developed and manufactured.
Many manufacturers procure the core devices for their products and outsource manufacturing to other companies. Epson has chosen a different path because we believe that if we were to buy the same parts as our competitors and produce similar products, then we would never be able to achieve our goal of creating products that exceed customer expectations.
Epson is researching and developing technologies and products that will surprise you
The idea underpinning Epson's strategies is to generate value that exceeds the vision of our customers by using a vertically integrated business model to leverage our unique core devices, which emerged from core technologies that we have developed for many years.
For a company like Epson, whose businesses revolve around its core technologies, research and development projects are crucial, but it is also extremely important to strategically use the intellectual property that emerges from the R&D process. R&D has to be conducted from both a near-term and a long-term perspective. The outcomes have to support our businesses of today and our businesses 10 or 20 years down the road.
Our ongoing R&D efforts will yield products and technologies that are sure to bring you positive surprises.
Becoming an Indispensable Company
Committed to changing the world
We at Epson aim to contribute to society and become an indispensable company by continuing to exploit our powerful original technologies to create one-of-a-kind products that others cannot replicate.
With a thorough knowledge of technology and unsurpassed manufacturing capabilities, we are committed to creating products that aim to change the world for the better and genuinely contribute to peoples' lives.
Toward that end, we want Epson to be the ultimate developer and manufacturer with world-class technology that exceeds your vision.
