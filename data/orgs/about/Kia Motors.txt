Who We Are
Who We Are World-class design and engineering. That's our mission. At Kia, we're inspired by the idea that you should love driving and owning your car. Designing, engineering, building, and bringing you that car is what we do. And we love what we do. Turns out we're not alone. Auto experts and everyday drivers love what we do, too. The 2017 Sportage won the Red Dot Award for Product Design in 2016. The 2016 Optima received Kelley Blue Book's KBB.com Midsize Car Best Buy Award. The word is out. The superlatives are gratifying. Yet we're determined to keep evolving.
To that end, Kia has been making news with a remarkable run of firsts. We introduced the superb K900, our first rear-drive, full-size luxury sedan. We debuted the Soul EV, our first all-electric, zero-emissions vehicle. The soon to come 2017 Optima Plug-In Hybrid is our first vehicle of its kind. The exciting firsts go on and on. From design to technology, materials to safety features, Kia continues to innovate and upgrade our entire lineup.
You deserve to own a car you love. We invite you to discover the “New Kia.”
As a company and as individuals, we're driving beyond past perceptions and discovering what's possible.
