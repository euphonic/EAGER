All rights reserved.Escape Therapeutics, Inc. is an early stage biotechnology company focused on accelerating the commercial  availability of allogeneic stem cell therapies by solving the key translational hurdle preventing their  clinical utility - immune mismatch and subsequent donor rejection.
Invented by Escape's founder Dr. Hantash while at Stanford University, our platform technology represents  a significant potential breakthrough that can revolutionize the treatment of numerous medical diseases that  require cell and/or organ replacement such as type I diabetes, Parkinson's, and leukemia, amongst others.  Escape's innovative technology allows for the creation of the world's first allogeneic, "off-the-shelf"  therapy capable of being used in any patient irrespective of their HLA profile without the need for adjunctive  immunosuppression, HLA matching, or autologous sourcing.
