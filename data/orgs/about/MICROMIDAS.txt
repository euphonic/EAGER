A new kind of
chemical company
It started with an idea.
We’ve always been obsessed with the fact that our material environment fundamentally changes about every 25 years. One day it occurred to us: What if we could lead the next wave of change? We realized that we'd need to change not just R&D, but our business model, our partnerships, and the way we relate to our own people. Today we lead the world in furan chemistry, with new and better processes for creating CMF, HTC and more. And the way we see it, this is just the beginning.
