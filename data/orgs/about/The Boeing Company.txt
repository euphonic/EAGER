Boeing is committed to providing the most current data available. We hope you find this information useful as you review our complete family of airplanes—including the only freighter family available today.
The prices above reflect an average price reflecting a range of available options and configurations for each model. Configurations and options that may affect price include performance capability, interiors, avionics, fuel capacity, etc.
All prices are in U.S. dollars and are in millions.
Aviation Safety
Safety is the primary consideration when Boeing engineers design an airplane. In addition to meeting regulatory requirements before certification, each airplane model must meet Boeing’s time-proven design standards. Often these standards are more stringent than regulatory requirements. Boeing airplanes are rigorously tested, and the company continually monitors the performance of airplanes worldwide to identify opportunities to improve safety.

StartupBoeing
Starting an airline is tough. Running a profitable airline is even tougher. From startup airlines to established industry leaders, the process involves constant learning and adaptation.
Few businesses have as many variables and challenges as airlines. They are capital-intensive. Competition is fierce. Airlines are fossil-fuel dependent and often at the mercy of fuel price volatility. Operations are labor intensive and subject to government control and political influence. And a lot depends on the weather.
But, the intrepid entrepreneur is not alone. The StartupBoeing team assists entrepreneurs in launching new airlines. From concept through launch, StartupBoeing offers guidance, review, analysis, data, resources, contacts, and referrals to qualified startup airlines.

Revenue Recognition Accounting Standard ASC 606 Information
During the first quarter of 2018, Boeing adopted a new revenue recognition accounting standard (ASC 606) which, among other things, imposes additional criteria for recognizing contracted backlog with customers beyond the existence of a firm contract to deliver. In connection with the application of ASC 606, 78 orders have been removed from backlog. Apart from adding the table below and modifying the "Changes" line in the 2018 Net Orders table to reflect any ASC 606 adjustments applicable to 2018 Net Orders, this site has not been adjusted for the adoption of ASC 606, and reflects all orders for which we have a firm contractual commitment. As such, aircraft identified for a specific customer on this site may not necessarily contribute to the totals for backlog and/or other amounts included in our financial statements. The figures in the table for Total Unfilled Orders and Backlog include the orders, listed on this site, of Boeing Capital Corporation.

History
Thank you for Celebrating our Centennial with us!
Since July 15, 1916, we've been making the impossible, possible. From producing a single canvas-and-wood airplane to transforming how we fly over oceans and into the stars, The Boeing Company has become the world's largest aerospace company. And we're just getting started.
Thank you for making 2016 unforgettable with events, activities and commemorations that celebrated not only our first century of innovation, but also the people and moments that inspire us to live by our founder Bill Boeing's philosophy -- "build something better."
We're writing our next century's history. Come along for a breathtaking flight.

Blazing the Trail of New Technologies
Download the Boeing Chronology
These pages describe the legacy of The Boeing Company, tracking the development of the companies that merged to become a single enterprise as the twentieth century ended.
Workers at these companies built passenger planes, helicopters, warbirds and missiles, satellites and spacecraft. They sent astronauts to the moon and brought cultures together in harmony aboard the International Space Station. Their inventions blazed the trail for today's new technologies.
Products Through Boeing History
During the last 100 years, humans went from walking on Earth to walking on the moon. They went from riding horses to flying jet airplanes. With each decade, aviation technology crossed another frontier, and, with each crossing, the world changed. Browse the products from Boeing and its heritage companies that crossed those frontiers: the hundreds of passenger airplanes, military aircraft, space capsules, rockets and more.
