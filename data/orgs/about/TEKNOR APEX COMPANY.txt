When Alfred Fain founded a small Rhode Island tire store in 1924, at the time no one could have predicted how Teknor Apex would become an international custom compounder sought out by companies around the world. After a nearly hundred-year journey that’s carried us through acquisitions and expansion, we now have nine U.S. locations, as well as operations in Belgium, Singapore, Germany, and China.
Throughout this global expansion Teknor has remained a privately held company, and today Fain’s grandson sits at the helm, maintaining the family’s tradition of fostering deep customer relationships. These relationships are what allow us—together—to deliver customized compound solutions and help you create better products.

At Teknor Apex we have a rich history of innovation, one that began in 1924 and has carried over confidently into the 21st century. While expansion has been a huge part of our story, what we are proudest of is our enduring status as a privately owned company, one that’s been guided by the same ethical compass for almost 100 years. While we’ve evolved to deliver custom compounds on a global scale, how our products are sold and how we treat our customers, partners, and employees still matters most to us, and influences every decision we make.
Using our interactive timeline below, you can dig deeper into our history to learn more about where we’ve come from, and where we’re going. The colored tabs allow you to streamline the timeline to uncover more about general Teknor moments, key acquisitions, and product breakthroughs, as well as how important world events impacted our company.
