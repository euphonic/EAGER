Featured Solution
Case Study: Copper Process Effects on FOUPs and FOUP Cleaning
When one of the world’s largest suppliers of semiconductor equipment wanted to study copper process effects on FOUP cleaning, they turned to us for a partnership arrangement. Our FOUPs were integrated in the fab and managed by our on-site personnel. FOUP life and interoperability were also studied.
This comprehensive program took advantage of our extensive laboratory testing facilities to help determine contamination issues. By partnering with us, this manufacturer ultimately benefited from an increased understanding of the interaction of advanced processes and FOUP cleaning.

Policies

Entegris is committed to the responsible sourcing of “conflict minerals” throughout our supply chain and to continuing to comply with the underlying SEC rules and regulations.
Entegris requires suppliers that provide tantalum, tin, tungsten or gold, or products containing these components, (which are then incorporated into products we manufacture for sale) to submit information that allows us to trace the minerals back through the supply chain to the source. In addition, Entegris expects our suppliers to adopt policies and establish their own due diligence program to be able to identify and certify whether any of the materials supplied to Entegris contain conflict minerals that are not conflict free. To provide information related to the Entegris Conflict Minerals Conformance Program, please email supplier.whistleblowing@entegris.com .
