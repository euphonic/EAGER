Company
SEaB Energy has patented the innovative Muckbuster® and Flexibuster™: compact, easy-to-install, turnkey Anaerobic Digestion (AD) systems in shipping containers. These are being installed globally, directly and through distribution and licensing agreements. Our products are considered a key component in the Future Cities planning process. The main office of the company is located at the University of Southampton Science Park, a prestigious hub of cleantech innovation in the South of England, where a Flexibuster™ has been successfully consuming the bio-waste of local businesses since 2011.
Production
SEaB Energy is a UK based company that operates from and manufactures in the South of England. At Belbins Business Park in Romsey, Hampshire, all components of the Muckbuster® and Flexibuster™ are fully assembled, ready to be shipped and quickly installed at your site. Additionally, this site hosts our own research lab, where we analyse how different feedstock samples from our customers behave in AD conditions. This allows us to accurately estimate how much green energy a Muckbuster® or a Flexibuster™ can produce for you.
Team
SEaB Energy was founded in 2009 by Sandra, the CEO, and Nick Sassow, the inventor of the technology. The company has evolved quickly since then and has put in place strong management, a commited and continuously expanding team and a highly experienced service department. Currently, SEaB consists of 22 people, speaking over 10 different languages. We look forward to installing one of our small waste-to-energy systems on your site, anywhere in the world.
