The Team
Many of us joined after already being members of the Plex community—a community very near and dear to our hearts. Some of us are movie buffs. Some are news junkies. Some are addicted to podcasts. Some are passionate about music and some are budding photographers. The one thing we all share is that we love our media, and we love the ubiquity afforded by the product we get to work on! And we really love that the constantly evolving landscape of mobile and connected devices gives us the opportunity to improve the way you consume your media, making it easier than ever to discover, enjoy, and share all of your media on all of your devices.
