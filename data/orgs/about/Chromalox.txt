Edwin L. Wiegand, a self-taught engineer from Pittsburgh, PA, had always shown an intense curiosity in electrical conductivity. In his makeshift laboratory off his family’s dining room, Wiegand experimented with ways to encapsulate the fragile and sometimes dangerous “open coil” heat technology of the time in a dielectric. This led to his groundbreaking patent in 1915 of a resistance-heating element embedded in an insulating refractory and enclosed in a metal sheath. On this technology, he founded Chromalox in 1917 and began producing the strip heater for what would become the modern electric clothes iron.
The next few decades were a boom period for Chromalox as electricity became a part of more homes and manufacturing plants. Heat and controls became integrated into systems, and Edwin Wiegand’s numerous patents found many applications in both the residential and commercial markets.
World War II created an enormous demand for portable heat on land and sea. Chromalox joined the war effort, and continues to be an integral supplier to military and aerospace.
Over the past half century, the ever-changing energy sector has opened up many areas for growth. Chromalox was the first supplier of pressurized heaters used in nuclear power plants and submarines. And as the world began shifting from fossil fuels to electric products, Chromalox has kept up with an ever-expanding portfolio of products and services around the globe.
1920's
With about 100 employees, the company moved from downtown Pittsburgh to a new plant in the suburbs (Homewood). As demand increased, Chromalox developed new materials and processing methods. The company took a giant step forward when electrical grade granular magnesium oxide (MgO) became available as insulation in tubular products.
Key Events

We design and manufacture the highest quality into each Chromalox product, and that allows us to produce systems that are tailored to our customers’ needs.
Component Technology Platforms
Chromalox component technologies provide sophisticated building blocks upon which applied technologies—and entire heating systems—are built. Quality, performance, and attention to detail are paramount at the even the most basic level in order to create systems that perform reliably long after installation and commissioning.
Metal Sheathed Heating Technologies
Chromalox manufactures a broad scope of metal sheathed components, including the industry’s longest tubular elements (over 40’ / 12 meters). We utilize a proprietary process to select
high quality
MgO and its critical grain size distribution. Our proprietary MgO mixtures for special cements,
dielectrics
high quality
products. We produce flat blade and pressed elements, including hermetic seals for a moisture-proof barrier. In addition, we manufacture metal sheathed components for strip and ring heaters, mica bands, and custom cartridge heaters. Metal sheathed heating technologies are capable of heating processes to 1800°F/982°C and can operate up to 4160 volts. Chromalox has over 230 patents on metal sheathed heating technologies and their associated production processes.
Polymer and Specialty Heating Technologies
Chromalox manufactures heat tracing cable, including
constant-wattage
cable, mineral-insulated cable, and self-regulating cable. We utilize numerous proprietary compounds, formulas, extrusion and annealing processes developed by our polymer scientists to deploy our specialty heating technologies. In addition, Chromalox manufactures skin-effect heating systems for long runs (over 10 miles/16km), and flexible heaters that can apply direct heat to most sizes, shapes, or contours. Our impedance heating systems temperature ranges are only limited by the process piping maximum temperatures.
Temperature Control Technologies
Chromalox provides custom control solutions, including temperature control algorithms and communication protocols. Chromalox engineering and design methodologies combine custom electronic solutions together with heating technologies to create a reliable long lasting thermal system.

Chromalox understands flow and heat transfer characteristics. We create custom baffle configurations to optimize both in our systems. In critical
applications
Chromalox is able to verify specific design elements using the latest software tools. This allows us to check and double check our calculations in a systematic way to ensure the safest and most efficient thermal system. For more complicated scenarios, Chromalox uses fluid dynamic and thermal modeling software models to optimize designs early in the development process. We are then able to confirm these designs in our
third party
testing.
From the very moment our customers identify a need, we’re ready to work with them at every level—planning, design and engineering, procurement, installation, commissioning, service—to deliver a product or system solution that meets even the most complex or challenging requirements. We can modify one of the 700,000+ top-level designs we have on file, or we can design and manufacture a completely new product or system that meets our customers’ budgets requirements with fewer design iterations and the shortest possible turnaround time.
