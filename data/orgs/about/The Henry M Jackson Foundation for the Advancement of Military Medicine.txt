HJF is committed to conducting business fairly and ethically.
HJF believes it is not only important to follow the laws and regulations, but also to take it one step further and do the right thing in every situation.
We realize that HJF's reputation is dependent upon the behavior of our employees. Therefore, we expect a high standard of conduct from all employees regardless of their position at the Foundation. By reinforcing and improving our ethics program, the Foundation continues to strengthen its reputation for upholding the highest standards of quality and ethical conduct.
We take every reasonable measure to ensure that our business practices are ethically sound. We have developed a detailed 
Code of Ethics
 for our employees. The Code of Ethics is also available to our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and sponsors.
As a supplement to the Code of Ethics, the 
HJF International Anti-Corruption Policy
 helps ensure that international business is conducted in a lawful and ethical manner and that HJF and its employees and subsidiaries comply with all applicable U.S. laws, including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), as well as all applicable local foreign laws. Consistent with the U.S. government, HJF has also adopted a zero tolerance policy with respect to human trafficking and forced labor in any form. HJF’s Combating Trafficking in Persons Policy, standard operating procedure and model compliance plan place all employees, agents, collaborators and contracting partners on notice that violations of the anti-trafficking rules and procedures will not be tolerated.
HJF provides several channels through which employees can seek counsel or disclose ethical issues. Their supervisor is usually the best source of information and guidance. However, there is also a list of 
contacts
 that may be used to assist our employees whenever necessary.
We are proud of our employees and the important role they play in supporting our military forces and improving public health.

Careers
Our organization dates to May 1983, when President Ronald Reagan signed into law a bill from Congress authorizing the establishment of the Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine.
Five months later, the private, not-for-profit Foundation was named in honor of the late Sen. Henry M. "Scoop" Jackson, D-Washington, who sponsored the legislation that led to its founding.
The Foundation’s core functions as outlined in the legislation remain as relevant as ever:
Supporting research and education at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and throughout the military medical community
Serving as a link between military researchers and private medical sector
Encouraging the participation of the medical, dental, nursing, veterinary and other biomedical sciences for the mutual benefit of military and civilian medicine.
Compared to its vast operations today, HJF was small in its early years; administering two federally sponsored research projects. Today, the Foundation manages more than 700 research grants, contracts and cooperative agreements and its projects range from small bench-top experiments to complex multisite programs

Henry "Scoop" Jackson
Henry Martin “Scoop” Jackson was a U.S. congressman and senator from the state of Washington from 1941 until his death in 1983.
For more than 30 years, Jackson was deeply involved in the major issues of American political life, from the drama of the Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954 to the liberation of Soviet Jewry in the 1970s. He became an acknowledged authority on national security, energy and environmental issues.
Jackson sponsored the legislation that established the Foundation for the Advancement of Military Medicine, which was named in his honor after his death. He was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom on June 26, 1984.
