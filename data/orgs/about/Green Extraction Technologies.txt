Green Extraction Technologies, LLC: We G.E.T. It
As an Urban Forestry Firm, we offer a different perspective than a traditional tree care company. Our goal is to maximize the benefits of trees in the Urban Forest and manage risks that could adversely impact their overall longevity. We focus on preserving the existing tree canopy whenever possible.
Our professional evaluations are driven by strong ethics and a passion for our industry. From the moment we step onto a client's property and into their green space, we feel that we are stepping into their personal oasis. We take into consideration the microclimate that is unique to each clientâ€™s property to offer focused arboricultural solutions. A consultative approach allows us to educate our clients and provide the reasoning behind any recommendations.
Leaders in The Fourth Wave of Conservation
Green Extraction Technologies, LLC is a leader in the fourth wave of conservation.
