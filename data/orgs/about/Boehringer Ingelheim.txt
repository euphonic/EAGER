The pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim was founded in 1885 by Albert Boehringer (1861-1939) in Ingelheim am Rhein. From its beginnings in 1885 when it employed just 28 people in Nieder-Ingelheim, the company has since become a global enterprise.
As part of research and development activities for innovative drugs, the company focuses primarily on the therapeutic areas of cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases, diseases of the central nervous system, metabolic diseases, virological diseases and oncology.
