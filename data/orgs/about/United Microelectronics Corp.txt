Intellectual Property Protection
We are entering an era in which reusable intellectual property (IP) is rapidly becoming essential to the design of advanced semiconductors. This presents opportunities as well as challenges to IP developers, semiconductor designers, and foundries. Among the most basic issues is the security of IP - how its integrity and its content can be preserved and protected throughout a complex process that begins from an idea to the finished product.
This document represents our formal commitment to 
IP protection
. The policies on how IP is handled by UMC employees and how we audit compliance with these policies are described in detail. We will gladly respond to any of your questions regarding these policies and are eager to hear your suggestions on how they can be improved.
However, we all know that policies, procedures, and contracts are meaningless unless they are based on an underlying philosophy of trust and respect. That is why UMC bases its IP policies on three principles:
Integrity -
We insist on honesty when dealing with our customers and ourselves.
Partnership -
Long-term partnerships provide the greatest success and can only exist in an atmosphere of respect and mutual support. 
Commitment -
UMC is committed to the success of our partners; only when that is achieved can we too, achieve our goals.

The company employs over 20,000 people worldwide, with offices in Taiwan, China, Europe, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and the United States. UMC can be found on the web at http://www.umc.com .
The Industry Leader
Founded in 1980 as Taiwan's first semiconductor company, UMC led the development of the commercial semiconductor industry in Taiwan. It was the first local company to offer foundry services, as well as the first semiconductor company to list on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (1985). UMC is responsible for many local industry innovations, including the introduction of the employee share bonus system, often credited as a primary factor in the development of a prominent electronics industry in Taiwan. UMC also enables customers to access complete supply chain information online through the MyUMC online service portal, an industry first when it was introduced in 1998.
Leading Foundry Solutions
UMC is committed to the timely delivery of leading-edge solutions that serve the specific and unique requirements of our customers in the face of today's advanced applications. UMC collaborates closely with customers as well as partners throughout the entire supply chain, including equipment, EDA tool, and IP vendors to work synergistically towards each customer's SoC silicon success. We also possess the required knowledge in system design and architecture necessary to properly integrate customer designs with advanced process technologies and IP. The result is a greater chance of first pass silicon success for today's SoC designs.
UMC's comprehensive foundry solutions start from a common logic-based platform, where designers can choose the process technology and transistor options that best fit their application. From there, technologies such as RFCMOS and embedded Flash can be used to further fine-tune the process for customers' individual needs. Furthermore, as IP has become a critical resource for today's SoCs, we have worked to provide basic design building blocks as well as more complex IP that are optimized for portability and cost, developed both internally and from third-party partners.
With advanced technology, a broad IP portfolio, system knowledge, and advanced 300mm manufacturing, UMC offers comprehensive solutions that help customers deliver successful results in a timely fashion.
