CALIENT Technologies is the global leader in pure photonic Optical Circuit Switching with systems that enable dynamic optical layer optimization in next generation data centers and software defined networks.
CALIENTâ€™s 3D MEMS switches allow data center operators to dramatically improve utilization rates of expensive compute resources which typically account for 75 to 90% of investment.
Data center operators and metro service providers also deploy CALIENT switches at the edges of their networks to facilitate multi-layer network optimization for maximum efficiency and flexibility. In this application the optical circuit switches support network-wide implementation of SD-WAN regardless of the vendor or vintage of the optical transport system.
The company designs and manufactures its systems using the state of art MEMS fabrication equipment at its corporate headquarters in Santa Barbara California.
