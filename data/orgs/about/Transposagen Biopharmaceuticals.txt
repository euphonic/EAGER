Transposagen, Inc. is a privately-held biotechnology company founded in 2003 to commercialize early gene editing technology for the construction of rodent models of disease. Since then, Transposagen has significantly increased its scientific offerings to include a suite of gene editing technologies and services that address the research needs of both academic and drug discovery investigators.
The company is headquartered in Kentucky, located in a newly renovated historic building near downtown Lexington. Transposagen’s growing success and the unique piggyBac™ technology have yielded two spin-off companies,  Poseida Therapeutics and Hera BioLabs , which focus on therapeutic development and toxicology testing, respectively.

piggyBac™
The piggyBac™ transposase technology is a non-viral, gene delivery system designed for use in many different research applications. With a large cargo capacity of over 200kb, piggyBac surpasses many other transposon and viral delivery vehicles, making it the optimal choice for stable cell line creation. The high efficiency and stability of piggyBac™ integration events have proven effective in a variety of genomes.
Capable of reversing integration events, it has proven helpful for phenotypic screens and precise (Footprint-Free™) gene editing projects. To date, over 550 peer-reviewed papers have been published as a result of the piggyBac™ technology.

The Footprint-Free™ gene editing system combines the piggyBac™ excision-only transposase with the utility of the latest site-specific nucleases technologies, including CRISPR and XTN™ TALENs. This process allows researchers to surgically alter a single nucleotide without creating unwanted mutations and select for very rare events.
