Hitachi High-Tech's Diversity Management
In the global marketplace, in which the Hitachi High-Tech Group operates, the changes in the business environment surrounding companies have become even severer. It is crucial that we continue to provide creative and pioneering solutions to our customers and society through continuous innovation to succeed in the competition. The Hitachi High-Tech Group respects diverse sensibilities and values and is working to incorporate them as one of our major initiatives to achieve growth. Placing “diversity management” at the core of our management practices is essential to lead us to produce organizational dynamics.
Supporting Science Education
Loss of interest in science among children and students is a problem that is facing developed countries. It is a critical issue that leads to diffi culties for corporations in securing personnel to conduct R&D and to reduced international competitiveness as a nation.
With our Basic Philosophy of “value creation through high-tech solutions,” we will contribute to professional development and the development of society by supporting science education, which leverages our technology and products including scientific instruments to the maximum extent possible.

We conduct activities to support science education, using tabletop electron microscopes that are manufactured and sold by Hitachi High-Tech.
We support a range of educational events, such as special lessons for elementary and junior high schools as well as displays at science museums and exhibitions, with the aim of stimulating children’s interest in science and technology through the experience of observing familiar specimens on a microscopic scale.

The Group encourages environmental business and environmental management based on the Hitachi Group’s Environmental Vision.
On the one hand, we contribute to environmental conservation through our regular business, on the other we promote activities for global environmental conservation activities, such as the conservation of ecosystems in the local area through various activities by companies, as well as employees and their families. As part of these efforts, Hitachi High-Technologies rented an approximately 2.3-hectare national forest in Ishioka City, Ibaraki from the government under the Forestry Agency’s Corporate Forest Program. The company named the forest the Hitachi High-Tech Yasato Forest, and has been working on a 60-year program of silviculture activities since 2005. New employees as well as interested employees and their families participate in work such as weeding and pruning to facilitate the growth of trees. Going forward, the company will continue to develop the forest until young trees are fully grown and cut down, thereby contributing to the conservation of the global environment and the prevention of global warming.
