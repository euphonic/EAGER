1 TDK’s beginning
At the time, the possibilities of ferrite were as yet unknown. Driven by a belief in its potential, a bold decision was taken. This venture spirit is at the very root of TDK and permeates the company still today.
TDK was founded about 80 years ago
following the invention of ferrite.
Ferrite was a chance discovery made by Dr. Yogoro Kato and Dr. Takeshi Takei at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Aiming to explore the industrial potential of the material, Kenzo Saito founded a company in 1935 that became TDK.

My role is to exert as a team leader in coordinating all aspects of Quality, Cost and Delivery (QCD) efficiency improvements, from proposals through final implementation. We are handling extremely small size products. To further improve our products, it is vital to focus in on tiny components invisible to the naked eye to make meaningful improvements. I firmly believe that the fruits of such efforts will not only raise efficiency, but also support growth both on a personal level and for the company as a whole. Another appeal of TDK is the stance of respecting employee individuality, combined with a corporate culture devoted to steadily nurturing personal skills. This is definitely the key to working with enthusiasm while fueling the desire for self-improvement. Based on a firm grasp of the expectations directed to me as a team leader, I undertake each challenge without fear of failure. Rooted in that attitude, I pledge to continue to do my very best from here on as well.

Financial Affairs / TDK Taiwan Corporation / Taiwan
Ever since joining TDK Taiwan, I have been in charge of financial and accounting duties. The words “Vision, Courage and Trust,” which are also contained in the company principles, have taught me many things and inspired steady changes in my own thinking as well. Yet another fine quality of TDK is the ability to build relationships based on by mutual trust between employees, who develop by working side by side in constructive rivalry. The workplace environment of respecting individual thinking and bringing out the best in each other’s abilities supports the growth of all members of the team. Under this approach we take responsibility for our individual duties, always seeking out new challenges and living up to the expectations of the customer. The goal is to continue to generate innovation closely matched to the times. That spirit, so alive and well in TDK, has also emerged as the driving force in my own life and endeavors.
Drawing out answers across divisions and national borders.
Thantip Parinyaprasert
Manufacturing / TDK(Thailand) Co.,Ltd / Thailand
As our Japanese language coordinator, I work to support communications between the Japan design and Thailand manufacturing divisions. Besides interpreting for those traveling here on business from Japan, I am also closely involved in the work of launching new equipment installations. Another key phase of my duties is to help with opinion exchanges across different divisions and countries in order to arrive at unified answers. While the responsibilities are heavy and the work can be quite formidable, the ability to undertake new challenges every day is the source of great pride and satisfaction. At TDK Thailand, we are also actively involved in traditional Thai events. One such example is the “Song Kran” water festival, in which water is sprinkled over managers as a means of showing respect. In such ways, there are numerous opportunities to engage in exchanges across the lines of divisions rank and position. I truly enjoy that part of the corporate culture here.
TDK is like a family to me.

The world's first application of ferrite as a ferrite core results in a dramatic reduction of noise.
Until about 1950, listening to the radio often was marred by noise and interference, and reception sensitivity was not very high.
But once ferrite cores came into use, the noise decreased and the sound became clearer, allowing more people to listen and to obtain a wide range of information.
During the postwar economic growth period in Japan, the advent of television ushered in the age of visual information.
Ferrite from TDK was used extensively for the deflection yoke cores in the CRT tubes of television sets which increasingly found their way into people's homes.

"Taking one's music along" creates a new lifestyle.
Cassette tapes designed specifically for music become immensely popular and make the TDK name known to the world.
Music on phonograph records or open-reel tapes required bulky equipment and therefore could only be enjoyed indoors, usually at home. Only after recording on the much more compact cassette tape became possible, people could take their favorite music with them.
A living environment came to be filled with music anytime, anywhere.
In the latter half of the 1970s , video cassette recorders (VCRs) for home use came onto the market. Benefitting from its extensive experience in audio cassette tapes, TDK began to mass-produce high-performance video cassette tapes.

After hard disk drives with high storage capacities were developed in the 1990s, more software such as spreadsheet or word processing programs, image processing software etc. could be installed on a single computer, and personal computers became an indispensable part of most offices.
The rapid progress towards smaller and lighter hardware with higher storage led to the spread of notebook computers.

A new type of radio triggers a sudden demand for ferrite.
In 1947, just after the end of WWII, the old type of radio (4-tube radios and similar) which suffered from noisy reception was replaced by a new principle called a superheterodyne receiver, offering much better performance. However, these receivers require an intermediate frequency transformer (IFT) that in turn needs a ferrite core, and orders for ferrite suddenly started pouring in at TDK, the only ferrite manufacturer in Japan at the time. This enabled TDK to overcome the difficulties of the postwar phase and build a solid foundation that lasts until this day. In 1955, Japan's first transistor radio hit the market. It was equipped with a bar antenna that used a ferrite core from TDK. In this way, TDK made a significant contribution in the field of radios which were the forerunners of today's wide range of audiovisual equipment.
Various types of deflection yoke cores
01 / 01
Ferrite demand jumps with launch of TV broadcasting.
In 1950, as NHK (Japan's national public broadcasting organization) began experimental television broadcasting, TDK embarked on the research and development of prototype ferrite cores for the deflection yokes and flyback transformers necessary in order to display an image on a cathode-ray tube. The cores were finally ready for mass production in 1953, around the same time when regular TV broadcasting got under way in Japan. Some seven years later, color TV broadcasting was launched in 1960. In the 1980s, TV screens rapidly became much larger, driving the demand for more complex deflection yoke shapes and higher performance. Power ratings also increased, leading to an increase in demand for power ferrite materials to be used in transformers for switching type power supplies.

Audio tape and video tape adopted by broadcasting stations
In 1950, the year the first tape recorder made in Japan was introduced, TDK embarked on a research and development project for magnetic tape as a new business, harnessing the company's strength in magnetic materials technology. Three years later, in 1953, a magnetic tape product called "Synchrotape " for open reel tape recorders was launched. Ongoing research resulted in further refinements in terms of materials technology and manufacturing techniques. In recognition of its broadcast level performance, Synchrotape was adopted by broadcasting stations in 1957. Technical cooperation by TDK also was instrumental in the effort to develop a locally produced video tape. In 1963, the "Synchro Video Tape" developed by TDK was selected for use in broadcasting. At the Tokyo Olympics held in the following year, about 60 percent of the video tapes used for broadcasting applications were TDK products.
SD cassette makes the TDK name famous worldwide.
The wider a magnetic tape, and the faster its travel speed, the more information can be recorded on it. In 1966, TDK brought a cassette tape product called "Synchro Cassette" onto the market, but due to the narrow width of the tape and its slow speed as compared to open-reel tapes, the cassette was not suitable for music recording. In order to solve this problem, TDK developed a new type of magnetic powder with vastly improved characteristics, which made it possible in 1968 to present the world's first cassette tape for music recording, branded as the "SD Cassette". With a clever sales strategy also paying off, the SD Cassette took the market by storm and received overwhelming feedback from users around the world. It became a monumental product that cemented the name of TDK as the world's foremost magnetic tape manufacturer.
Contributing to TDK's image and brand recognition
The first video tape recorder (VTR) was introduced in the U.S. in 1956, but the extremely high sales price limited its appeal mainly to TV stations and similar. Followed by the open-reel type, the 1960s saw the introduction of cassette type video recorders (VCRs), and in the 1970s , two competing systems of more compact VCRs for household use were developed: Betamax and VHS. TDK had already been supplying video tape as an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), but as VCRs gained in popularity, TDK released a video tape product under its own brand name in 1978. To meet increased production capacity needs, a new plant dedicated to video tapes was constructed at Mikumagawa (Hita City, Oita Pref.) in 1982. At the time, video tape accounted for more than half of the company's entire net sales. TV spots and other types of advertising provided a strong boost to TDK's name recognition and significantly lifted the company's brand image.
A new technology for cobalt coating the needle-shaped magnetic powder
The characteristics of the magnetic powder which is applied on the plastic base film have a vital influence on the performance of the magnetic tape. By employing a powder with extremely fine needle-shaped particles for the SD Cassette, TDK was able to break through the performance barrier of cassette tapes, making them a viable music recording medium for the first time. Moving towards further advancement, TDK perfected a new technology in 1973 for coating the surface of the needle-shaped particles with cobalt. This enabled outstanding characteristics significantly better than the chromium dioxide that was the standard for high-performance tapes at the time. The new magnetic powder called "Avilyn" became the basis for the entire range of "SA" (Super Avilyn) products for music and video. The excellent sound and image quality afforded by these tapes provided a major boost to the culture of audio and video recording.
1972

TDK's first multilayer ceramic chip capacitor in the 4545 format (4.5 x 4.5 mm)
Multilayer chip inductors
Chip components and SMT (Surface Mount Technology) by automated placement equipment
In the early days of electronics, most electronic components used to have long "legs" in the form of lead wires that were inserted into holes on the printed circuit board and then soldered to create a product. But in the 1970s a major innovation revolutionized the way in which electronic products were built. Very small chip-like components without lead wires are placed directly on the printed circuit board by high-speed automated pick-and-place equipment in a process that became known as SMT (Surface Mount Technology). An ultra-thin pocket radio that came onto the market in 1976 was the very first consumer product manufactured with SMT, and it featured multilayer ceramic chip capacitors from TDK. In the course of the next decade, chip components became ever smaller, triggering an amazing reduction in size and weight of electronic products.
Chip components realized with fine multilayer technology from TDK
Inductors are normally made by winding coil wire around a magnetic core. But a breakthrough technology introduced by TDK in 1980 made it possible for the first time to form a coil by a layering process without winding, resulting in the world's first multilayer chip inductor reaching the market. TDK followed this up by "fine multilayering," a proprietary, highly advanced technique for simultaneous sintering of different materials such as ferrite and dielectric ceramics. Further development extended the technique to composite chip components integrating capacitor and inductor functions, and to a multilayer integrated device (MHD) comprising an IC. All of these greatly contributed to make portable electronic devices such as video cameras and personal music players much smaller and lighter while at the same time capable of higher performance.
Multilayer ceramic chip capacitors
01 / 02
Alternating dielectric sheet and internal electrode in layers
Currently, more than 80% of all capacitors manufactured worldwide are multilayer ceramic chip types. A single smartphone or notebook computer may contain upwards of 500 of these. The world's first multilayer ceramic chip capacitor was developed in the U.S. in the 1940s, but it saw only limited use in special military or industrial applications. Only after mass production technology had been developed in Japan in the 1970s, multilayer ceramic chip capacitors found their way into consumer products in large numbers. There are many different variations and manufacturing methods, but the basic principle involves screen-printing of the internal electrodes on a dielectric sheet, layering the result, and then cutting it into individual chips.
Applications include noise countermeasure components and circuit protection devices
The availability of electronic components in chip format since the 1980s, along with the progress of SMT (surface mount technology) has greatly contributed to the realization of smaller, lighter, and higher functionality electronic equipment. TDK applied its original fine multilayering technology not only to capacitors and inductors but also to various other chip type products including noise countermeasure components and circuit protection devices. Turning electronic components into chips requires highly accurate screen printing techniques, advanced processing methods, and superior materials technology. Of utmost importance is a full mastery of the entire range of electroceramic materials which includes ferrite (magnetic ceramics), dielectric ceramics, and semiconductor ceramics.

Ferrite magnetic heads used widely.
Magnetic materials technology from TDK not only was crucial for the tapes used in tape recorders and VTRs, it also provided benefits in the field of magnetic heads. Ever since developing an erase head for tape recorders in 1963, TDK has been active in the area of magnetic heads for audio applications such as cassette decks and VTRs, and in industrial applications as well, including for example heads for magnetic card readers in admission ticket vending machines and bill exchange machines. Ferrite not only provides superior magnetic characteristics, it also has excellent abrasion resistance, making it highly suitable for magnetic heads whose surface is constantly being swept by the media such as magnetic tape or cards during recording and playback.
Origins of the head core piece using ferrite
Prior to the invention of the HDD (hard disk drive), cylindrical magnetic drums were used as storage devices for computers. TDK's magnetic head business for computers has its origins in 1960, when the company embarked on the development of a head core piece for magnetic drums, using ferrite. The product released two years later became known as the "boat shaped head core" because its cross section resembled that of a boat. To meet the demands of higher-density recording, the "IBM 2314 compatible head core piece" was developed in 1968, followed by the development of the Winchester head in 1972, providing another boost to TDK's accelerating magnetic head business.

PAGE TOPOnly a full understanding of the material makes this possible.
What characterizes TDK as a company is the fact that we have the technology to create electronic components from scratch, starting with materials developed in-house.
This requires a deep understanding of the properties of the respective materials.
We also are a world leader in sophisticated techniques for producing highly precise components with tiny dimensions.
The result is unparalleled products that only TDK can make.
Five core competences for producing cutting-edge electronic components.
Manufacturing ferrite and other magnetic materials is where TDK has its origins. Add multilayering of electronic components, thin-film techniques, and spintronics where the rotation of electrons is controlled individually.
Furthermore, TDK harnesses a wide range of nanotechnologies in the quest to further expand the potential of magnetics.
Multifaceted advances are born out of these five core competences.
Materials technologyAccumulating more than 80 years of know-how and history.
TDK’s materials technology pursues the characteristics of the source material from the atom level on up, to meet highly sophisticated needs.
For example, materials design is based on carefully controlled ratios of main material and minute additives to realize exactly the required properties on a high level.
A wealth of research and extensive experience accumulated over a period of more than 80 years makes this possible.
TDK outdistances competitors on the strength of its proprietary tech power.
Process technologyRealizing control on the nanometer level.
Process technology is the science of getting the best out of the characteristics of the material.
Thin-film technology and spintronics are just two examples where manipulation on the order of nanometers (one billionth of a meter) is employed to create state-of-the-art electronic components.
An example is the creation of a thin film on a wafer to form an electrode, coil, or head element.
The method is applied to HDD heads, thin-film components and other products.
Evaluation and simulation technologyAccurately analyzing the ultra-fine aspects of a process.
Even the most advanced materials and process technology would not lead to successful product development without accurate analysis and simulation techniques.
Starting from material analysis, TDK evaluation and simulation technology is widely applied to assess structural and thermal aspects, analyze electromagnetic field properties, and perform noise measurement and design noise countermeasures using an anechoic chamber.
Ultra-precise methods are needed for evaluating ultra-fine technology.
Product DesignProduct design technology combines expertise with innovation to create new ideas.
Product design uses insight into how our products are used, integrating materials and electronic components from our many product lines, to create electronic devices and modules with safe, optimal configurations. It also encompasses software design that harnesses the full features of those devices and modules.
Additionally, TDK supplies energy units which combine power conversion, storage, and energy control functions. These integrated solutions have quickly become crucial for life in a sustainable society.
Production technologyBuilding even the manufacturing equipment in-house.
Excellent products can only come from excellent manufacturing facilities.
TDK not only develops innovative manufacturing techniques but realizes these by building much of the required equipment in-house. This is the key to the superior Monozukuri craftsmanship for which TDK is famous.
The TDK policy of QCD (Quality, Cost, Delivery) is being further strengthened to create a system of integrated production extending from source material to finished product.
Realizing the same outstanding quality regardless of location.
That is what TDK tech power means.
TDK is aiming for a unified Monozukuri standard. This involves the realization of a "location-free" concept whereby products of exactly the same quality level can be manufactured at any of our sites around the globe.
Building upon our expertise in mechatronics gained through the manufacture of electronic components, TDK supplies load ports for various wafer sizes and flip-chip bonders as well as various other advanced factory automation equipment.
Industrial robots and the production line itself are equipped with a multitude of TDK sensors that enable management of production status and quality in real time.
The collected data are analyzed in the cloud, making it possible to eliminate non-conformances and predict and avert possible breakdowns.
