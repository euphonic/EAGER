International scope, discoveries and fresh opportunities
We were born in Italy, but right from the start we’ve looked beyond our national
                  boundaries. We work worldwide, combining our operations with plans for the development
                  of local communities. We believe in dialogue, integration, transparency and the sharing
                  of skills. We want to grow in tandem with the people who work with us.

Eni's History
The six-legged dog
Ettore Scola: “Man’s best friend on four wheels”.
The Eni logo
The six-legged dog, which was designed by Luigi Broggini and re-designed twice, in
                  1972 and 1998, by Bob Noorda, tells the story of our company through graphics and
                  literature. In over sixty years it has changed its shape but not its skin and with
                  its paws in Italy and its head in the world it has always managed to look ahead.

EniHistory
An absorbing journey through time, examining the twists and turns in the company's
               history alongside the moments that shaped Italy and the world. On the website dedicated
               to Eni’s evolution you can follow the key events in chronological order or explore
               different themed ‘paths’, focusing respectively on innovation, internationality,
               respect for communities, research and culture. Times have changed, but our values
               have remained the same.

Enrico Mattei: “Genius lies in seeing opportunity where others don’t”
In 1953, he founded a company on values of innovation and internationalisation, immediately
                  foreseeing that natural gas, up until then unknown in Europe, would enable the Italian
                  industry to kick-start the economic boom. Today, the legacy is plain for all to see.

Company Profile
An energy company
Reliability and sustainability: watch the video that describes Eni's mission
Eni: an Italian company with a worldwide presence
We are one of the global oil and gas super-players – operating in 71 countries
               worldwide and employing around 33,000 people. As of March 31, 2018, the company's
               market capitalisation was calculated at $64 billion. Eni is consistently ranked among
               the top 150 companies on the Fortune Global 500 list according to revenue. Here
               is a preview of our main oil and gas exploration, production, refining and selling
               operations, electricity and chemistry – the foundations on which our work is
               based – and the values that inspire our actions.
Upstream
Upstream refers to our onshore and offshore projects, from choosing oil exploration
                        blocks and drilling wells through to our hydrocarbon production operations. Cutting-edge
                        seismic surveying and subsoil analysis technology, as well as sophisticated tools
                        and the expertise of our geologists and engineers, allow our oil fields to begin their
                        productive life.
                     
Mid-downstream
Our global operations 
Our integrated approach means contributing to the development of the countries in
                        which we work. Our firm belief, which dates back to the time of our founder Enrico
                        Mattei, is that oil-producing countries should be self-sufficient in terms of their
                        energy supplies. We build a relationship of trust with our partners and create sustainable,
                        long-term value.
                     
The values that inspire us
Eni stands for sustainability, innovation and environmental protection. These principles
                        guide all our actions and provide us with a unique way of working. Our activities
                        have always been focused on respecting human rights, compliance with safe and fair
                        working standards, environmental protection and the fight against corruption.

OUR PEOPLE: VIEW THE INFOGRAPHIC
Eni and energy transition
In 2017, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) recognised us as one of the leading oil and gas companies on the Climate A List. We are heading increasingly towards the decarbonization of the energy system. Natural gas represents an opportunity for us to strategically reposition ourselves, given its lower carbon intensity and the possibility of integrating it with renewable sources in the production of electricity. We want to invest in the methane supply chain in order to continue to reduce CO

Eni's transformation and its short- and long-term results
The strategy launched in 2014, which is now producing significant results, is a necessary
                  response to the complexity of the energy world. What are the pillars that support
                  the new strategy?
               
Our Business Model
Focus on | Our strategy for a low-carbon future
The continuous creation of value
Between 2014 and 2017, Eni completely overhauled its structure. Eni is now a fully
               integrated O&G company, focused on its core operations, targeting greater efficiency
               and higher cash generation in all businesses. In less than four years, Eni has been
               set to grow in a lower-price scenario, enhancing value for shareholders.

INTEGRATED RISK MANAGEMENT
Our management
We identify, analyse, quantify and monitor risks and develop strategies to manage
                     them.
Awareness at all levels
Eni has developed and adopted a model for Integrated Risk Management (IRM) that aims
                  to ensure the company takes risk-informed decisions. In addition, the IRM model seeks
                  to increase awareness at all levels of the organisation that appropriate risk assessment
                  and management can affect the company's value and ability to deliver on targets.
               
Integrated Risk Management Model
Risk Governance and guidelines for Risk management
Risk Governance attributes a central role to the Board of Directors (BoD) which defines
               the nature and level of risk in line with strategic targets, including in the evaluation
               process all those risks that could be consistent for the sustainability of the business
               in the medium-long term.
            
Risk management
The BoD, with the support of the Control and Risk Committee, outlines the guidelines
                        for risk management, so as to ensure that the main corporate risks are properly identified
                        and adequately assessed, managed and monitored.
                     
IRM Process
Eni’s CEO, through the IRM process, presents every three months a review of
                        the Eni’s main risks to the Board of Directors. The analysis is based on the
                        scope of the work and risks specific of each business area and processes aiming at
                        defining an integrated risk management policy.

A model that aims to strengthen the organization awareness
Risks are potential events that can affect Eni's activities and whose occurance could
               hamper the achievement of the main corporate objectives.
            
Business risks
We identify, monitor and manage business risks including market risks, country risks
                        and risks associated with the cyclical nature of the Oil & Gas industry.
