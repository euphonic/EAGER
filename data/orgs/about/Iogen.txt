Iogen is  a leader in developing technology to make clean burning, renewable cellulosic  biofuels  (sometimes referred to as second generation biofuels, or second generation  ethanol) from agricultural  residues and other organic wastes. This advanced biofuel could replace over 30% of U.S.  petroleum consumption, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90% compared to gasoline.
Iogen has  been in the field for over 35 years; invested roughly $500 million in research,  development and demonstration; and have over 300 issued and pending patents.
We are the world`s first company  to successfully use modern "enzymatic hydrolysis" technology to  produce commercial quantities of cellulosic ethanol for field demonstrationsâ€¦  beginning production in 2004.
We are one of the first companies  to build and successfully start-up a fully commercial cellulosic ethanol  facility, which weâ€™ve done in collaboration with our partner Raizen Energia,  Brazilâ€™s largest sugar and ethanol producer.   The facility is located adjacent to Raizenâ€™s Costa Pinto sugar mill in  Piracicaba, Brazil and began commercial production in 2014.
We are also developing new ways  to use biogas as a transportation fuel.  Biogas,  another cellulosic biofuel, is an abundant product of natural organic decay,  but it has had only limited use as a transportation fuel.  We intend to change that.  Our technology will give biogas direct access  to a 7 billion gallon annual market.
What we do:
We develop and implement  processes for making cellulosic biofuels.   Our team includes scientists, engineers and project managers.  We work with partners to deliver the most  efficient, reliable and cost-effective systems for making this low emission,  renewable advanced biofuel.
