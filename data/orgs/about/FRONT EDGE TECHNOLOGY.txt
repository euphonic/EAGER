Front Edge Technology (FET) was established in 1994. FET develops,            manufactures and markets next-generation, ultra-thin rechargeable batteries            for card-type applications.
FETâ€™s product, NanoEnergyÂ®,            is thinner than a piece of paper. When embedded in micro devices, NanoEnergyÂ® acts as an autonomous power source, which enables new functions of these            micro devices and greatly adds their value. FET is working with its            customers to develop next generation self-powered micro systems.
