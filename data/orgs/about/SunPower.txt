window.$ = jQuerySunPower has been developing record-breaking solar technology since the 1970s. Our history over these decades has been marked by creativity, craftsmanship – and confidence.
1970s
Our record of solar innovation began nearly four decades ago, when our co-founder, Dr. Richard Swanson, was pondering ways to deal with the oil crisis. At that time, solar cells were being used on satellites, a concept he found intriguing. His engineering challenge was to figure out how to make the cells more cost-effective. So he began a quest that, almost 40 years later, has helped position SunPower as a leader in residential, commercial and utility-scale solar power production.
1980s
By 1985, Dr. Swanson (who by then was a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford) had been awarded grants from the Electric Power Research Institute and the U.S. Department of Energy to support his solar power explorations. With the help of these funds – as well as financial support from two venture capital firms – SunPower was officially incorporated in April 1985.
1990s
In the 1990s, SunPower received initial funding from Associate Venture Investors and Technology Funding and an R&D contract from EPRI and US DOE. SunPower solar technology was used to power some of the most innovative applications for solar power race cars and airplanes.

1997
SunPower high efficiency solar cells power NASA's Pathfinder, an unmanned, remotely piloted, solar-power, high altitude aircraft.
2000s
This decade was filled with many accomplishments and milestones for SunPower. The company became publicly listed on the NASDAQ with CEO Tom Werner taking the company to new levels. SunPower set new world records in solar cell efficiency.
2001
Our world-record efficiency A-300 solar cells power NASA's Helios project, achieving a record altitude of 96,863 feet.
