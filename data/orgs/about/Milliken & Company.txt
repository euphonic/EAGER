“Company Culture is the product of a company’s values, expectations and environment” - C. Chapman

Page Intro Text
At Milliken, we believe ethical behavior is the right thing to do as an organization and as a community. As a long-held, core value of our company and our shareholders, it is the foundation of our lasting business success. Honesty, integrity, and ethical behavior are the responsibility of every Milliken associate. We must conduct ourselves in accordance with the highest business standards, provide safe environments for our associates, and manufacture with sustainable practices.  How we achieve success is as important as the success we achieve.
The Code of Conduct is our guide to ethical business behavior.  It cannot address every situation or circumstance, but it can be summarized in one simple idea: “Do what is right.”  We do not simply follow the letter of the law; we follow and exceed the spirit of the law.
If at any time you believe our company’s values of honesty, integrity, and ethical behavior, or compliance with the law may be at risk, you must bring the situation to the attention of the company through your immediate manager, Human Resources, or Legal Department.  You may also anonymously report your concerns through the Milliken Ethics Help Line. ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
Ethics Help Line Dialing Instructions
Section Text 1

2.  After dialing the direct access code, you should hear a prompt.  You should then dial 866-327-8419 
Milliken promises that no one will be retaliated against or punished for bringing information to our attention in good faith.
