Energy Technology Solutions is committed to bringing unique real estate solutions to the business community. Entech does this by addressing two of the largest issues facing companies who own or manage real estate; the long term cost of roof replacement and roof maintenance, and escalating utility costs.
Entech is focused on solutions which provide sustainable energy generation and long term roofing protection with little to no capital expense to the owner. If your business could decrease its annual operation expenses while securing renewable energy and not spend a penny in the process, would it make sense to your business objectives? Wouldnâ€™t this be a great story to tell your employees and/or tenants? We think so.
