Copyright©2017 ADEKA CORPORATION All Rights Reserved.The origins of ADEKA go back to Tokyo Denka Kogyosho, a company headed by Furukawa Gomei Kaisha established in 1915 for the purpose of production of electrolytically-produced caustic soda. The company was founded back in those days at the dawn of the chemical industry in Japan with the aim of launching domestic production of soda products, a field that had thus far been dependent on imports. Concomitant with reorganization into a joint-stock company in 1917, the company launched operations under its new name of Asahi Denka Co., Ltd. With the launch of production of hydrogenated oils using hydrogen in 1919, the company expanded its business into the chemical industry with soda and oils and fats as its two mainstays.
Subsequently, the company further expanded, diversifying into the fields of chemicals and food, thus setting its course to the present day. In the field of chemicals, ADEKA manufactures a wide diversity of products ranging from additives for semi-manufactured organic and inorganic products and plastics to fine-chemical products such as high-functional chemicals for semiconductors and digital home appliances, contributing to a wide range of fields of industry including electronics, automobiles, civil engineering and construction, electrical machinery and paper manufacturing.                      In the field of food, ADEKA applies it fat and oil processing and emulsification technologies to develop processed oils and fats such as margarine and shortening and processed food products such as whipping cream to support a rich and varied dietary life.
At the present time, ADEKA has manufacturing plants in Kashima, Chiba, Mie, Fuji, Akashi and Soma as well as R&D centers in locations such as Ogu (Tokyo), Urawa and Kuki. The company is also proactively expanding its business by establishing an organization capable of adapting to diversifying market needs by reinforcing its R&D and sales capabilities with the addition of affiliate companies through industrial cooperation. Overseas too, ADEKA is promoting the reinforcement and expansion of its existing overseas plants and, at the same time, expanding its business to regions where growing demand is anticipated.
In keeping with its management policies of "Work hard to be a forward-looking organization by staying on the cutting edge" and "Be a respected member of the world community," ADEKA endeavors to supply global markets with competitive products of excellence.
