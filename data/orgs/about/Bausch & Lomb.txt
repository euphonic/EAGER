Vision and Age
60+ Eyes
60+ Eyes
You've worked hard; at last there is time to focus on yourself.  Time to enjoy friends or grandchildren, read a book or play a round of golf.  And enjoy your continued good vision.
It’s a fact of life that your eyesight changes as you get older, sometimes significantly. That’s why regular 
eye exams
 are even more important as we age. Be sure to visit your eye doctor and learn about potential 
eye concerns
. By being well-informed, you can recognize signs of trouble – and possibly slow the progression a sight-threatening disease. 
You might not realize that other health issues can affect the quality of your vision as well. In particular, diabetes and high blood pressure can lead to vision problems – especially if these conditions are allowed to continue without treatment. When you see your eye doctor, list all of your current health issues and your family history of illness. The more your eye care professional knows, the more they can help protect your eye sight for years to come.
Long-term 
eye health
 is also maintained by exercise, diet, and rest. Exercise improves blood circulation, which improves oxygen levels to the eyes and removes toxins. Make sure you are eating foods rich in antioxidants and getting enough rest. Studies have shown that antioxidant minerals and other vitamins may help combat free radicals, and slow or prevent related diseases. Free radicals are unstable molecules – unchecked, they can damage cells in the eye, which may lead to serious vision problems, such as 
cataracts
 and age-related 
macular degeneration
 (AMD).
Proper eye care doesn't have to be expensive. In fact, many insurance policies will cover the cost of routine eye exams as well as any treatments your doctor may prescribe. Some may even cover or contribute to the cost of 
vision correction
 such as prescription eyeglasses or contact lenses.
