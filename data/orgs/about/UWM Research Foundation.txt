About UWMRF 
Transforming Research and Innovation at UWM
The UWM Research Foundation was launched in 2006 to complement the UWM Foundation, Inc., and support research and innovation at UW-Milwaukee. The UWM Research Foundation would not be possible without the support of forward-looking organizations and Foundations. We are deeply grateful to 
the Bradley Foundation, the Herzfeld Foundation, Rockwell Automation Charitable Corporation, GE Healthcare 
as well as others who see the value in our efforts.

Furthering the development of knowledge
In 2016, UWM was designated as an R-1 research intensive university by the Carnegie Classification System of Higher Education placing UWM among 115 top-tier research institutions in the nation out of more than 4,600 institutions. The UWMRF continues to help create an environment that attracts, retains, and supports innovative researchers who contribute to this important distinction by building and delivering programs that transform research and innovation at the UWM – including the Catalyst Grant Program and an array of entrepreneurship and innovation programs.
