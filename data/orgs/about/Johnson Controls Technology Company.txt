About Us
Our History
In 1885, long before anyone talks about carbon footprints or climate change, Warren Johnson launches a company to explore new ways to harness and conserve precious energy resources. In doing so, he also launches a tradition of customer-focused innovation—a tradition that has inspired thousands of employees for more than 130 years and that continues to drive the success of Johnson Controls. Even before he founds the firm now known as Johnson Controls, Warren Johnson is the quintessential inventor. His pneumatic tower clocks, electric storage batteries, wireless telegraph business and steam-powered luxury cars and postal service trucks anticipate—and shape—the future.
History Timeline

1885–1910:
The Spirit of Invention
In the age of Edison, Bell, Daimler, Pasteur, Tesla and Ericsson, anything seems possible. It’s an era of firsts: electric lights, internal combustion engines, X-rays and hydroelectric power plants.
Against this backdrop, Warren Johnson toils for three years to invent a device to regulate room temperature. In 1883, he receives his first patent for what will be known as the electric room thermostat—an invention that launches an industry and changes how people live. Within two years, his quickly growing Johnson Electric Service Company brings evenly regulated temperatures to buildings around the world.

1895
Warren Johnson and associates patent steam valves, steam traps, pressure reduction valves, water heaters, hydraulic air compressors and electric meters in developing the first automatic zone temperature control system. A century later, the American Society of Mechanical Engineers calls it  “the grandfather of all control systems.”

16 / 61
1925
Johnson Service Company buys the patent for a dual thermostat developed by the chief custodian of the New York City schools (and a Johnson Service Company customer). The device lowers temperatures automatically by sensing increasing air pressure when occupants leave a room and reduces fuel consumption—a boon during the Great Depression.
17 / 61
1929
Many companies cut costs when the stock market crashes, but Johnson Service Company’s sales remain strong for years due to a backlog of orders—and a rising demand for the dual thermostat, which automatically cuts fuel consumption when spaces are unoccupied.
18 / 61
1934
A worsening economy forces Johnson Service Company to lay off workers, reduce salaries and move sales offices to salesmen’s homes. With construction stagnant, the company focuses on retrofitting older buildings with the Duo-Stat, which saves fuel by adjusting indoor temperature as outdoor conditions change.
19 / 61
As the Depression grinds on, government employment programs generate construction projects for private and public buildings that need temperature regulation systems. When war breaks out again, the U.S. government classifies Johnson Service Company’s products as essential.
The war’s end unleashes demand for new buildings with modern features like air conditioning. Johnson Service Company responds by developing a pneumatic control center for controlling temperature from one location. Emphasis shifts from individual room controls to “zone control systems.”
20 / 61
1938
Joseph Cutler, who started with Johnson Service Company as a sales engineer in 1912, becomes president. Over the next 22 years, he reorganizes the sales force and adds 79 branch offices, and sales grow from $3 million in 1939 to $67.3 million in 1960.

26 / 61
1956
Business booms for Johnson Service Company as control systems grow more complex. The numbers of employees, branches and installations hit all-time highs, thanks to demand for pneumatic control centers that let one person monitor an entire building’s room and water temperatures and ventilation from one location.
27 / 61
Expanding Worldwide
Johnson Service Company’s sales surpass US$1 billion after merging with Penn Controls. The renamed Johnson Controls expands its technological capabilities through acquisitions, starting with Globe-Union, the largest U.S. manufacturer of automotive batteries. By adding seating and plastics machinery firm Hoover Universal and seating supplier Ferro Manufacturing, Johnson Controls can design, engineer and assemble complete automotive seating systems.

C. O. Wanvig, the first president of Globe-Union, is born
Dec. 7, 1890
On December 7, 1890, Chester Odin Wanvig, the first president of Globe-Union (the ancestor company to Johnson Controls' Power Solutions Business Unit), was born in Milwaukee.  Chester's father was John D. Wanvig, a Norwegian immigrant who was widely known as a master of ships which plied the Great Lakes.  As a boy, Chester worked his way up from deckhand to wheelsman on his father's coal and ore ship, and also sold newspapers.  He went on to attend the Michigan College of Mines at Houghton for a time, but left to clerk at a steel company.  At the age of 20, Chester became general manager and secretary of the Wallace Smith Co., then the nation's largest manufacturer of saddlery.  After gaining financial control of the company, he liquidated it in the early 1920s and subsequently purchased (with his brother) the Globe Electric Company.  Globe's 1925 purchase of Central Radio Laboratories (later known as Centralab) proved fortuitous in that it immediately preceded the radio craze that would sweep America.  Also, about this time, Wanvig formed Union Battery Company to serve as a supplier to Sears.  In 1929, the assets of Globe Electric and Union Battery were consolidated and the Globe-Union Manufacturing Company was organized.  Automotive batteries came to represent Globe's major success, much of which was owed to Globe's engineers and their patented equipment and processes.  Under Wanvig, growth continued apace, with sales of batteries, Centralab electronic components, roller skates, and spark plugs reaching $50 million by 1955.  Wanvig was president of Globe-Union until 1949, chairman of the board from 1949 to 1953, and from 1954 to 1958 he served as both board chairman and president.  Upon Wanvig's retirement in 1958, his son, Chester O. Wanvig, Jr., became president of Globe-Union.  Wanvig, Jr. was still at the helm of Globe-Union in 1978 when it was acquired by Johnson Controls.

Nov. 6, 1847
On November 6, 1847, Warren Seymour Johnson, the founder of Johnson Controls, was born to Charles and Emeline Johnson in Leicester, Vermont.  Two years later, the family boarded a sailing vessel in Buffalo, New York, bound for Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  The family settled first in Waukesha and, later, to homesteads in central and northern Wisconsin.  By some accounts, Johnson had a harsh childhood, marked by the death of his mother in 1855.  He received little formal schooling, but acquired a self-taught education from books, observation, and experimentation.  In a precursor to his later career as an inventor, Johnson kept a book in which he sketched and described a number of inventions in the fields of chemistry, electricity, and mechanics.  As a young man, Johnson worked on his father's farm and in the lumber mills of northern Wisconsin.  He also learned the printer's trade and, at the age of 17, secured the position of foreman in the office of the Lean Wolf, a Durand, Wisconsin, newspaper.  In the next 10 years of his life, Johnson worked as a surveyor and school teacher.  Eventually, he became the Superintendent of Schools for New Lisbon, Wisconsin in 1874.  In 1877, Johnson took a position as a professor of mathematics, sciences and drawing at the State Normal School in Whitewater, Wisconsin.  During his teaching tenure there, he came up with his idea for regulating temperature in buildings through the use of thermostats - an idea upon which he founded this company in 1885.

Oct. 20, 1902
Upon conclusion of the Johnson Service Company (Johnson Controls' former name) board meeting on Oct. 20, 1902, the directors decided to inspect the construction of the company's new headquarters being built on the southeast corner of Jefferson and Michigan streets in downtown Milwaukee.  Of particular interest to them was the selection of exterior brick.  Their first choice of brick had not yet come in after two months' wait, so the board took action.  According to the minutes, " ... after inspecting several different kinds, a light shade of red pressed brick submitted by Rickertson & Schwarz was selected, the price to be $15 dollars per thousand."  Subsequent Johnson buildings erected around the original headquarters are of the same color brick, making the Company an easily recognizable presence in today's downtown Milwaukee - not bad for a brick that came in second place.

Sept. 5, 1958
On Sept. 5, 1958, Globe-Union, Inc. (predecessor to today's Power Solutions group) produced its 50 millionth battery for Sears, Roebuck & Co. Then Sears President Charles H. Kellstadt and other Sears officers were present when the 50 millionth battery (bearing a special coat of gold paint) was taken from the production line at Globe's Milwaukee manufacturing plant. After photo ops, the commemorative battery (accompanied by Miss Milwaukee of 1958, Carmen Shields) was transported in an antique automobile to Milwaukee's Mitchell Field.  From there it was flown to Detroit (the "Motor City"), where it was to be placed on permanent display at a Sears store.  Globe began making automotive batteries for Sears in 1927 - today, Power Solutions continues to supply batteries to Sears. Pictured from left, Shields, Kellstadt and Globe-Union president C. O. Wanvig, Sr., as they admire the 50 millionth battery.

Johnson Service and York help put man on the moon
Aug. 15, 1965
On Aug. 15, 1965, the trade journal Contractor announced "U. S. Moonport Takes 10,000-Ton Air Conditioning System."  The "moonport" referred to in the article was the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) under construction at the Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island, Florida (shown in ad from 1965).  The VAB was built to vertically assemble the stages of the Saturn V rocket for the Apollo program, the NASA project that eventually landed the first man on the surface of the moon in July 1969.  At the time, this was the largest building in the world by volume at 129 million cubic feet (for comparison, the Pentagon is 77 million cubic feet in volume).  The 525 foot high, single-story structure's interior was so large, in fact, that it was feared that rain clouds might form at the top of it without proper environmental control.  Johnson Service Co. (Johnson Controls' former name) and York were involved in overcoming the unique challenges posed in providing the proper climate needed for precision assembly of several-stories-high rockets.  York supplied the four 2,500-ton "Turbomaster" water chilling units at the heart of the building's air conditioning system, while Johnson installed the pneumatic climate controls.  Until recently, the VAB was used for the preparation of the Space Shuttle for launch; in the future, the VAB will be used to prepare commercial launch vehicles, and for NASA's new Space Launch System.

July 29, 1896
On July 29, 1896, the York Manufacturing Co. (York) completed construction of its new plant in York, Pennsylvania.  York, founded in 1874 and acquired by Johnson Controls in 2005, had originally occupied a two-story building on Penn Street in downtown York.  Its first products were washing machines, turbine water wheels, corn planters and cultivators, and shaft pulleys and hangers.  However, most of the company's early revenue came from machine repairs - not equipment sales.  By 1885, the young company had entered the field of ice and refrigerating machines, which after some initial tough times, would prove where the company would find success.  In 1893, the company purchased land and buildings in west York near the Northern Central Railway in order to expand and modernize its factory production.  After receiving architect J. A. Dempwolf's plant designs, company president Phillip Glatfelter realized that the company had insufficient capital to carry them through to completion.  In order to raise the necessary funds to construct the factory, Glatfelter decided to incorporate the company in 1895.  Work on the new plant was begun on July 13, 1895.  However, the expense of the new plant and equipment, along with lagging sales, and a severe national economic depression, caused another financial crisis for the company in 1896 - which was only resolved with the hiring of Thomas Shipley to manage the company in 1897.  Shipley, who had built his reputation in the refrigeration machine business at the Frick Company, instituted a number of changes that soon put York on the path to becoming an industry leader.

June 21, 1939
On June 21, 1939, Olav, the crown prince of Norway, visited Globe-Union, Inc.'s (the predecessor of today's Johnson Controls Power Solutions business unit) Milwaukee battery manufacturing facilities during his U. S. tour.  Prince Olav came at the invitation of Globe president Chester O. Wanvig, himself a proud Norwegian-American who had donated generously to charitable causes in Norway.  And whatever became of Olav?  Well, it took almost 20 years from the time of his Milwaukee visit for the man who would be king to actually become king (in 1957), a role that he served until his death in 1991 at the age of 87.  Nicknamed the "People's King," his passing prompted a great outpouring of grief by the Norwegian people, who lit hundreds of thousands of candles in memoriam in the courtyard outside the Royal Castle in Oslo. (Norway's Prince Olav and Princess Martha are pictured attending a concert in Milwaukee during their June 1939 visit.)

May 1, 1885
The first board meeting of the Johnson Electric Service Company (Johnson Controls' original name) took place in the office of Milwaukee financier William Plankinton in the Plankinton Hotel on Friday, May 1, 1885.  The incorporators and original stockholders were Plankinton, who was named president; Warren Johnson, who was named vice president and treasurer (while Johnson would serve as day-to-day company manager, he would not be named president until 1901); and Captain Irving Bean, who was named secretary.  They had filed incorporation papers several days earlier, on April 20.  The Company charter was to "manufacture, sell, and deal in electric and pneumatic apparatus, and to construct and apply the same to public and private buildings in order to regulate temperature ... ."  At the meeting, Johnson assigned his patents to the Company and agreed to assign all future patents in the field of temperature regulation to the Company as well.  As to finances, the capital stock of the Company was $150,000 - 3,000 shares at $50 each.  Plankinton contributed the total capital amount of $150,000, for which he received joint ownership in Warren Johnson's patents and 1,499 shares.  Johnson also received 1,499 shares, with the remaining two shares going to Irving Bean.

Czech ambassador's visit
April 17, 1996
Michael Žantovský, the Czech Republic's ambassador to the United States (pictured, left), discussed his country's future with Johnson Controls management during a visit to Milwaukee, Wis. on April 17, 1996.  Žantovský stressed his country's stability, stating "we have the most stable environment of all the post-communist countries.  There has been extensive privatization, coupled with a relaxation of trade and economic regulations.  Our currency is strong, the economy is growing steadily and there is a solid influx of foreign investment."  James Keyes, Johnson Controls' CEO and chairman at that time (pictured on the right), agreed with Žantovský's comments and promised to expand the company's presence there.

Airport installations
March 29, 1983
An article about Johnson Controls system installations in airports in the U. S. and abroad was featured in the March 29, 1983 edition of "Briefing," a newsletter for Johnson Controls managers.  One such installation was at Heathrow - London's well-known airport.  Johnson Controls Systems Limited used an SDC 8001 (see photo) building automation system for the Heathrow project.  Earlier in 1983, Johnson had been awarded a full systems and services contract for work on the 1984 Olympics-related expansion of the Los Angeles International Airport.  Other Johnson airport projects at that time included those in Zürich, Switzerland; Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; Frankfurt and Düsseldorf, West Germany; and the Schiphol airport in Amsterdam.

Feb. 20, 1938
"Recessions bring good business for Globe-Union, Inc., in roller skates …" states the caption for this photograph published in the Milwaukee News-Sentinel from Feb. 20, 1938.  According to Globe (which was acquired by Johnson Controls in 1978), roller skate sales increased in hard economic times (this was the Great Depression era) as families sought more inexpensive forms of recreation.  Globe began manufacturing roller skates in 1931 at its Milwaukee plant (where this photograph was taken) as a means to maintain employment of workers subject to seasonal lay-offs in its other divisions.
By the early 1950s, the company had become one of the nation's top three makers of roller skates.  Production eventually moved to a new suburban Milwaukee facility in 1962.  Three years later (1965), Globe sold its roller skate manufacturing operations to the Aluminum Specialty Company of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, indicating at the time that roller skate manufacturing no longer fit with its other product lines (e. g., batteries).

Jan. 7, 1925
Johnson Controls' international activity in its first 40 years was not confined strictly to the European continent and Asia.  In fact, one early Johnson Service Company (Johnson Controls’ former name) installation occurred in South Africa.  A drawing dated Jan. 7, 1925 and depicting the "layout of automatic control of refrigerating plant" was completed for the customer Dowson & Dobson of Johannesburg, South Africa.  The firm still exists in South Africa to this day; it is now known as D & D Industrial, a member of the Actum Group.View Our Brands
