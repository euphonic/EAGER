Overview
Kala Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Kala) is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of therapeutics using our proprietary mucus-penetrating particle (MPP) technology, with an initial focus on the treatment of eye diseases.
Our MPPs are selectively-sized nanoparticles and have proprietary coatings. We believe that these two key attributes enable even distribution of drug particles on mucosal surfaces and significantly increase drug delivery to target tissues by enhancing mobility of drug particles through mucus and preventing drug particles from becoming trapped and eliminated by mucus.
We have applied the MPP technology to create nanosuspensions of loteprednol etabonate, or LE, a corticosteroid designed for ocular applications, resulting in our two lead product candidates; INVELTYS™ (KPI-121 1.0%) for the treatment of inflammation and pain following ocular surgery and KPI-121 0.25% for the temporary relief of the signs and symptoms of dry eye disease.
The name Kala was inspired by the famous Kalalau trail, a hiking trail on the island of Kauai, Hawaii. This trail is not only notable for its strenuous path and terrain that is difficult to traverse but also known for its unsurpassed beauty.
Kala is the first company I’ve seen that’s actually developed a way to get through mucus to penetrate the mucosal barrier.”
Robert Langer, ScD, Kala’s Co-Founder and Koch Institute Professor at MIT.
