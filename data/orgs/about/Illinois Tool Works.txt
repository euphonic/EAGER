The foundation of our company is the ITW Business Model, a unique and differentiated set of core capabilities and business practices that comprises three key elements: ITW’s 80/20 Front to Back Process, customer-back innovation and a decentralized entrepreneurial culture.

80/20
 Front to Back Process
Expand 
+
ITW’s proprietary 80/20 Front to Back Process has been integral to the company’s success for nearly 30 years. Through the implementation of this process, each ITW business focuses on the 20 percent of its customers that generate 80 percent of its revenues and structures the business around serving and growing relationships with these key customers. The efficiencies gained from 80/20 deliver best-in-class operating margins, strong free operating cash flow and differentiated returns on invested capital. ITW’s commitment to 80/20 is stronger than ever, and the company continues to make the investments necessary to ensure that 80/20 remains a key driver of its competitive advantage now and in the future.
Customer Back Innovation
Expand 
+
ITW’s unique approach to customer-focused innovation has fueled decades of profitable growth. The company’s innovation efforts are “80/20-enabled” as its businesses focus on building relationships with major customers to develop deep knowledge and insight around their key needs and pain points. Working innovation from “the customer back” sets ITW apart, and it is these key customer insights and learnings that drive innovation at ITW. The company’s portfolio of more than 17,000 granted and pending patents reflects its ongoing commitment to developing innovative solutions for our key customers.

Chicago financier Byron L. Smith places an ad looking to invest in a manufacturing business. A small group of tool inventors comes forward, and together they launch Illinois Tool Works in Chicago in 1912.
Moving toward specialized and patented products, ITW makes its first acquisition, Shakeproof Screw and Nut Lock Company. The company’s innovative washers solve stubborn auto manufacturing problems, just as the industry is taking off.
Harold Byron Smith, grandson of Byron L. Smith, succeeds his father, Harold C. Smith, as company president. ITW continues to sell to radio and farm equipment markets with hopes of diversifying the company. ITW even advertises in mainstream publications—a first for a manufacturing company. Through careful management, ITW shows a profit every year of the Great Depression.
ITW contributes to the World War II effort by developing an innovative wafer cutter that enables faster manufacturing of heavy artillery barrels. Shakeproof and other divisions are split off as autonomous companies, laying the groundwork for ITW’s future decentralization.
ITW forms Fastex to take plastic fasteners and other components beyond automotive applications. It moves into computer and defense markets with innovative electric switches and the Spiroid® right-angle gear. The Smith family creates the ITW Foundation to manage the company’s wide-ranging philanthropic efforts.
“You’re never more than a few feet away from a product of ITW” is heard on local radio stations as ITW expands into new industries and reaches beyond North American markets. The company’s first self-drilling screw opens the door to the construction market, and the Hi-Cone six-ring carrier, one of ITW’s most successful and well-known inventions, transforms the beverage and packaging industries.
Officially listed on the New York Stock Exchange, ITW becomes a publicly traded company and grows rapidly by supplying products—including Deltar’s new advanced plastics—to auto manufacturers around the world. The company also acquires Devcon, a major step toward solidifying industrial polymer offerings. The ITW Patent Society is founded to honor ITW’s greatest innovators.
ITW embarks on an active acquisition strategy to sustain growth and diversification. Over the decade, 32 acquisitions double ITW’s size to 1.5 billion. To stay nimble, leadership decentralizes ITW by handing control over to individual businesses. Top-down functions are few—rigorous policy and a culture of shared risk support business-level decisions. The “ITW Toolbox,” a set of business rules that includes the 80/20 business model, is integrated within ITW operations.
Approximately 100 worldwide acquisitions throughout the 1990s expand ITW’s global presence. Important acquisitions like the Miller Electric welding company and Premark International—ITW’s largest acquisition to date—expand the company’s reach into the growing welding and food equipment industries. ITW becomes one of the top U.S. patent holders.
ITW’s presence expands in global emerging markets, and revenue generated outside North America dramatically increases. ITW now has businesses operating in every corner of the globe, including the emerging markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China. Important acquisitions like Instron, Kester and Speedline introduce ITW to the growing test and measurement and electronics industries.
