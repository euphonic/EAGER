San Antonio, Texas based Rapamycin Holdings, Inc. (RHI) is developing and commercializing eRapa™, a novel formulation of rapamycin, that suppresses a variety of cancers and other age-related diseases.
The patented oral formulation offers improved pharmacodynamics over generic rapamycin, including better shelf life stability, increased bioavailability, and more predictable blood levels. This formulation, eRapa™, was originally developed for use in aging studies at the Barshop Institute for Longevity and Aging Studies at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio (UTHSCSA), and it is the only pharmaceutical agent tested thus far to demonstrate significantly increased health span and lifespan in rodent models.
Science, Nature, and Time magazine proclaimed the discovery of a special formulation of rapamycin to extend one’s life and health span among the most significant and exciting scientific breakthroughs of 2009. In addition, Dr. Randy Strong, Dr. Dave Sharp and a supporting cast of researchers with the Barshop Institute have discovered applications to treat diseases in the fields of oncology, immunology, neurology and trauma.
RHI began operations in late 2012 and has a portfolio covering 5 issued patents, 6 UTHSCSA patents pending, and 5 RHI patents pending for the use of our patented formulation of rapamycin to address large market opportunities in cancer, dementia, autoimmune disease and post-surgical adhesions. These patents cover the novel formulation as a composition of matter, the manufacturing process for the formulation, and a variety of method of use patents covering our unique dosing and treatment regimens in multiple target disease indications.
