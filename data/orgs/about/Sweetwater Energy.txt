Sweetwater owns patented technology that allows us to produce two unique and remarkable platform feedstocks for a broad array of products and applications that compete directly with products derived from petroleum and food grains. The two platform products are cellulosic sugars and clean non-sulphonated lignin fiber. Final products and applications from our sugars and lignin include: alcohol, industrial acids, plastics, pollution control media, and products for food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics.
