Our Mission
Our Mission to Transform Treatment Outcomes in Cancer | Genomic Health, Inc.
World’s Leading Provider of Genomic-Based Tests for Personalizing Cancer Care
Our Mission: To transform treatment decisions and outcomes in cancer by delivering clinically actionable diagnostics and services for patients.
Our Vision: To revolutionize the treatment of cancer throughout the patient journey.
Genomic Health is the world's leading provider of genomic-based diagnostic tests that address both the overtreatment and optimal treatment of early-stage cancer, one of the greatest issues in healthcare today. The company is applying its world-class scientific and commercial expertise and infrastructure to lead the translation of massive amounts of genomic data into clinically-actionable results for treatment planning throughout the cancer patient's journey, from diagnosis to treatment selection and monitoring.
Founded in 2000, Genomic Health is committed to improving the quality of cancer treatment decision making through the research, development and commercialization of genomic-based clinical laboratory services. The company conducts sophisticated genomic research to develop clinically validated molecular diagnostic tests that provide individualized information on the likelihood of cancer disease recurrence, and — in some cases — response to certain types of therapy.
Genomic Health developed and follows a highly specialized process that adheres to applicable global regulations and standards, including CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments) regulations and CAP (College of American Pathologists) in the U.S. to deliver the highest standards of quality and proficiency testing.
