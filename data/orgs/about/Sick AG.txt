About SICK
SICK's company history
When used in combination with precise optics and intelligent electronics, light can provide the answer to a wide range of issues. This potential was recognized quite some time ago by Dr. E.h. Erwin Sick, who set up his own company back in 1946. In the years that followed, Sick developed his company into a global provider of intelligent sensors and solutions for industrial automation technology.

1946
The company known today as SICK AG is born:
Erwin Sick obtains a license from the American military government in Munich to set up his own engineering firm.
1952
Presentation of the first marketable accident prevention light curtain at the International Machine Tool Trade Fair in Hanover. The orders that followed led to the initial serial production and the economic breakthrough.
1956
The company moves to Waldkirch, Germany with its 25 employees.
1972
The first subsidiary is founded in France.
1975
The company expands overseas with the founding of a subsidiary in the USA.
1988
Erwin Sick dies at the age of 79. Gisela Sick takes over from her husband and leads the company as its primary shareholder.
1996
Erwin Sick GmbH changes its company status to an “Aktiengesellschaft” or joint stock company.
1999
The first employee shares are issued domestically and abroad.
2006
SICK celebrates its 60th anniversary.
2017
SICK now has more than 50 subsidiaries and equity investments as well as numerous agencies around the globe. SICK achieved Group sales of about EUR 1.5 bn. in the 2017 fiscal year with almost 9,000 employees worldwide.
1909
Erwin Sick was born on November 3 to a train driver in Heilbronn, Germany.
1924 - 1928
Apprenticeship in the field of optics.
1932
Start of career at Siemens & Halske, Berlin, as an optical arithmetician; however, the department was closed after six months. He was moved to the laboratory and was given experimental, arithmetic, and constructive tasks, particularly in the area of color film.
1934 – 1939
Employment – initially as a constructor, later as an engineer – at Siemens, Bosch and Askania working on demanding development projects on color film, cinematics, and astronomical and physical devices.
1939 - 1945
Laboratory manager at the optical works of A.C. Steinheil & Söhne, Munich.
1944
Married Gisela Neumann.
1945
Became self-employed: In an old barracks in Vaterstetten near Munich, where Erwin Sick lived with his wife, he single-mindedly followed his technological development aims to produce opto-electronic devices. He used the earnings from selling radios he made himself to support his family.
1946
Founded what was later to become SICK AG on September 26: The apolitical Erwin Sick received a permit from the American military government to practice his profession as an engineer.
1949
First orders received at the “Achema” fair in Frankfurt after a long hiatus. This was an exhibition meeting for chemical apparatus organized by suppliers to the chemical industry.
1951
At the “German Inventor and New Development Trade Fair” in Munich in July, Sick presents the first wooden model he had made of his light curtain and receives a certificate for exceptional creative performance. On October 20, the patent registration for the light curtain invented by Erwin Sick based on the autocollimation principle is the technical breakthrough and forms the basis of an entire range of devices.
1952
Sick presents the first marketable accident prevention light curtain at the Second International Machine Tool Trade Fair in Hanover. The orders that followed led to the initial serial production and eventually to the company's economic breakthrough.
1954
Erwin Sick tries in vain to obtain a loan from the Free State of Bavaria to build up the company. When Baden-Württemberg offers to lend him the money he needs, he moves from Munich to Oberkirch in Baden.
1956
Relocation of the company – along with its 25 employees – from Oberkirch to Waldkirch into the building of August Faller KG, located at An der Allee 7-9. 
In October, Sick is granted the patent for a new type of photoelectric retro-reflective sensor that will later become the product with one of the company's strongest sales.
1960
Founding of the “Institute for Automation” in Munich for developing optoelectronic devices for industrial applications. Sick's main argument for founding the organization in Bavaria's state capital is the shortage of qualified engineers in Waldkirch.
1971
Erwin Sick is presented with the Bundesverdienstkreuz 1. Klasse (Order of the Federal Republic of Germany, Ist Class) by Justice Minister Rudolf Schieler on November 26 to commemorate the company's 25th anniversary.

 Moved into the new factory on Sebastian-Kneipp-Strasse, which remains the company's headquarters to this day.
1980
On November 19, the Faculty for Machines at the Technical University of Munich awards Erwin Sick his honorary doctorate in engineering in recognition of his contribution to the scientific and constructive development of optical devices with electronic signal evaluation.
1982
On December 2, Erwin Sick receives the gold Diesel Medal for his numerous inventions in the field of opto-electronics.
1988
Erwin Sick dies on December 3 after suffering a fatal heart attack at the age of 79.

About SICK
Research and development
SICK's history is rife with successful innovations, and we intend to continue this success story well into the future.
Customer focus: The key to our success
Innovative products on their own are not enough to ensure a company's success. Rather, it is a matter of making sure that these innovations provide outstanding customer benefits, because the ultimate measure of the newly developed products is how successful they are on the market. Our success relies on us implementing these thought processes consistently, and it is our knowledge and understanding of what our customers need that allows us to anticipate future developments. In this way, our customers reap the benefits of more compact designs with the same level of performance, increased sensor ruggedness, and faster, more efficient workflow processes.
SICK – Sensor Intelligence.
Developing intelligent solutions for customer applications is at the forefront of what we do. To make this a reality, we are constantly on the lookout for new technologies that allow sensors to not only perceive objects, but also offer intelligent process control and communicate with other components in complex networks.
Research and development activities
We are constantly increasing our research and development activities to allow us to retain our status as a technological and market leader.
Research and development staff
At SICK, we don't simply rely on our central research departments and remote development teams of more than 1100 employees worldwide to carry out our research and development activities. To ensure that our sensors are accessible to all system environments and our customers can benefit from synergies in the development process, we also cooperate with industry partners, universities, and institutes.
Patents and knowledge
Innovations are what set us apart, and this is something we want to continue in the long term. This is why we use patents to protect our knowledge. With about 3,000 patents filed, it is clear just how many ideas our staff have developed.
