OKI Group Values
The OKI Group Action Principles we enacted in September 2016 give formal expression to values shared by all OKI Group executives and employees. Amid large changes in the business environment, we seek to embed these principles as extensively as we can into our practices with the commitments expressed in the OKI Group Charter of Corporate Conduct and the OKI Group Code of Conduct as the cornerstones of our corporate activities. We seek to realize our corporate philosophy by striving to embody our vision.
Corporate Philosophy

Action Principles
OKI Group Charter of Corporate Conduct / OKI Group Code of Conduct
Corporate Philosophy
In 1881, only five years after Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone, OKI developed the first telephone in Japan. This is how OKI began, becoming Japan’s first telecommunication equipment manufacturer.
Since then, "Enterprising Spirit" is in the genes OKI has been nurturing and passing down throughout its long history

“Enterprising” means trying something new without being attached to conventional ways. With OKI's corporate philosophy, “Enterprising Spirit,” we will continue to provide products that contribute to developing an information society and offer an enriched life to people around the world.
Vision
※
Mono-zukuri: to have the spirit and mind-set to innovate, create and improve products
※
Koto-zukuri: to work together, proactively seeking opportunities that deliver value to customers

THE FOUNDING SPIRIT
With his enterprising spirit, Kibataro Oki (1848-1906) was far ahead of his time in the late 1800s. In January 1881, convinced that the nation was about to enter the age of communications, he founded Meikosha, the origins of today's OKI.
