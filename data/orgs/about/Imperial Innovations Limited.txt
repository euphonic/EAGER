About Imperial Innovations
Imperial Innovations is the technology transfer office for Imperial College London.
With a focus on societal and economic impact, we develop and commercialise technologies developed by Imperial academics.
We are a subsidiary of 
IP Group plc
, the developer of intellectual property-based businesses
.
Imperial Innovations works exclusively with 
Imperial College London
 to develop, protect and commercialise novel technologies through licensing to established companies or forming start-ups.
Our relationship with Imperial College London is covered by a technology pipeline agreement that grants us exclusive commercialisation rights over unencumbered intellectual property developed at the College.
Imperial College London is a world-leading university focused entirely on science, technology, medicine, engineering and business. It is ranked among the top ten universities in the world (source: QS World University Rankings 2015/16).
In an average year, we assess around 400 inventions disclosed by Imperial staff, complete 30-40 licence deals, form 8 new companies and file patents on 60 new technologies.
In addition to working with Imperial College London, we provide technology transfer services to select NHS Trusts in London linked with the College.

About
What we do
We work with researchers at Imperial College London to help develop their novel research into new businesses, products or services.
We support the process of taking an idea from the lab into the market. Importantly, we take the commercial risk, paying for IP protection up-front – Imperial inventors don’t pay a penny to work with us.
We assess inventions, considering commercial potential, the state of the market and development requirements
We protect intellectual property through patents and other appropriate forms of intellectual property protection
We provide advice on establishing proof of concept, using our commercial experience to inform inventors about what businesses want to see
We may provide development funding or support inventors in their applications for funding from other sources
We advise on IP and commercial strategy
We manage the licensing process (including negotiations and post-deal administration)
Our Venture Support Unit establishes new businesses, finds mentors and management and provides access to preferred suppliers
Above all we are flexible in our support – capable of executing novel deals and providing unique support where required.
