Welcome to the future of the sustainable solar + battery storage for the connected home or business. Welcome to SolPad.
SolPad gives you the ability to experience true energy independence with total control of your power. SolPad uses future‑forward design paired with a disruptive level of system integration.
With this approach, SolPad reduces the installed cost of solar power with battery storage by up to 50% when compared to other available solar + storage products.
SolPad is creating and defining a new sustainable energy future that will help clean up our environment and make the power of the sun accessible to everyone.
“Labor and technical soft costs are the hardest problems to solve when it comes to integrating solar and storage with software. SolPad did an amazing job of inventing new technologies and packaging them in a way that is both consumer and installer friendly.”
Barry Cinnamon
CEO of Spice Solar and a Longtime Solar Industry Installer
“Everyone is talking about the integrated solar product of the future that will truly change the global industry. SolPad already built it. They will change the way solar is accessed, not only in the US, but also in the developing world.”
Emily Kirsch
Co-Founder and CEO, Powerhouse
“The transformative promise of solar is that it turns the old energy paradigm — one of centralized polluting power plants and captive consumers — on its head by putting power literally in the hands of people. It empowers consumers to produce their own homegrown energy, to save on their energy bills, and to be the change they want to see in the world. The SolPad shows us what that energy future looks like, all in one simple, functional and super-cool product that puts the consumer first.”

Impact:  SolPad was founded with a humanitarian mission in mind, to provide cost-effective and flexible power alternatives to people living in expensive power regions around the world.  Multiple years of R&D have led to a different approach than most traditional solar companies, combing a robust Solar + Storage system that has proven to be an ideal solution for everything from small commercial installations to hurricane damaged areas such as Puerto Rico.  In our efforts to assist the residents of Puerto Rico, SolPad has acquired $61m in Purchase Orders from two of the most reputable and largest installers on the island and will soon begin deployment of these life-saving systems.  SolPad offers long-lasting renewable energy solutions that can start on a very small scale (one to two panels and batteries for backup power) and then easily scale to entire whole home energy or commercial systems.  The potential to assist the military, relief organizations, businesses and the average energy consumer are limitless.
