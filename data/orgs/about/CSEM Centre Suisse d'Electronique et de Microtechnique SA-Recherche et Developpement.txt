© 2018 CSEM SA. Terms and conditionsHistory
Switzerland—the early 1980s. There is a real concern that the country is losing ground to its neighbors when it comes to new technologies. But the federal council has a visionary plan. It creates a private research and development center, and in 1984 the CSEM success story begins.
Neuchâtel—famous for its long tradition of watchmaking and microtechnology—proves the ideal location for this groundbreaking innovation hub. Three of the canton’s microtechnology institutions (the Centre Electronique Horloger (CEH), the Fondation Suisse pour la Recherche en Microtechnique (FSRM), and the Laboratoire Suisse de Recherches Horlogères (LSRH)) merge. The Centre Suisse d'Electronique et de Microtechnique (CSEM) is born.
From day one, a number of well-known Swiss companies support the new center. Many become shareholders and maintain links with CSEM as it develops.
CSEM is committed to both applied and industry-commissioned R&D. A bridge and catalyst for the transfer of technology and know-how between science and the economy, we continually adapt our research focus to meet industry’s needs. And this constant re-adaptation has taken the center beyond its historic ties with watchmaking. Since Beta 1—the world’s first electronic watch (developed by CEH)—first paved the way for the use of microtechnology in domains other than horology, we have moved microtechnology into many new fields. Today, CSEM supplies a broad range of markets—including automotive, medical, machine tools, and space exploration—with an even broader range of technological solutions.

Values and ethics
CSEM strives to create and maintain an exceptional working environment. That environment favors openness and creativity, and fosters excellence, competence, and growth. It is founded on values such as trust, equity, respect, tolerance, diversity, and a commitment to honesty and gender equality. And it helps CSEM’s employees strike the ideal work–life balance.
CSEM draws its values together into a charter of ethics based on three principals—equal rights and obligations, fair and correct treatment for all, and nurturing a collaborative working environment. Equal rights means, among other things, the right to be treated with respect and the right to make mistakes as long as you learn from them. It also means the right to be treated equally independent of gender, nationality, age, or function. Equal obligations means, among other things, giving our best, and a dedication to teamwork, flexibility, confidentiality, and improvement. It also means attentiveness to customer needs—the customer is always entitled to our fullest attention and commitment.
CSEM’s support for a workplace that promotes collaboration and innovation means encouraging a positive, dynamic, and supportive working environment. It means a dedication to constructive conflict resolution, and the promotion of tolerance and enthusiasm for the job at hand. To work at CSEM you need to be ready both to accept responsibility and to show initiative. The rewards are—we believe—outstanding.
Corporate social responsibility—Milestones in sustainable development
CSEM practices environmental, economic, and social sustainability. We do this by working on projects that protect nature and its resources, by developing and maintaining partnerships that increase profits and competitive advantage, and by being an entrepreneur that enhances and takes care of its human capital. The technologies CSEM develops add value to its industrial clients, helping make those companies themselves better places to work.
CSEM’s dedication to corporate social responsibility is founded on three pillars:
Limiting our impact on the environment ( swissclimate.ch )
CSEM regularly implements infrastructure improvements that reduce energy consumption and its environmental impact. We’ve also put in place systems for optimizing accident prevention, for handling dangerous materials, and for recycling and waste management.
Committing to our employees
In line with our stated values, we’ve introduced a range of measures to reconcile the world of work with the world of family life. These include encouraging gender equality, and offering a company crèche, job sharing, the option of part-time work for all functions, and teleworking or telecommuting. A good work–life balance is the best way to reduce stress and ensure harmony in the workplace. Achieving that balance and ensuring the well-being of all its employees are high priorities for CSEM.
Acting ethically toward society while driving economic growth
At CSEM, we believe sustainable development is the only responsible approach to economic growth and that its importance will only increase as time passes. Our operating model—based on a unique public–private partnership—gives us the flexibility needed to address a broad range of applied research. This is how we face the challenges of tomorrow, pursue our commitment to innovation, and ensure economic stimulus, even in challenging times.
By integrating elements of sustainability into our innovative processes and business strategies, we help our clients get to solutions faster and access new markets.

Mission—Ensuring competitiveness through technology transfer
CSEM is a national innovation accelerator—a catalyst for the transfer of technologies and know-how from fundamental research to industry. This role involves four principal tasks:
we develop and maintain technology platforms,
we integrate and combine technologies into workable systems,
we mature those technologies until using them will add value to our industrial clients,
then we support the process of transferring those technologies to industry.
The development of our highly innovative platforms is supported by the Swiss Confederation, by the Cantons of Neuchâtel, Basel Land, and Graubünden, and by the cantons of central Switzerland (Obwalden, Luzern, Nidwalden, Schwyz, Zug, and Uri).
Vision—Technologies that make the difference
CSEM aims to be one of the world’s top innovation centers. We want working with CSEM to be the natural choice for every Swiss company seeking to innovate with microtechnologies. We strive to be the ideal workplace for the world’s best engineers and researchers.
The object of our mission—ensuring the competiveness of Swiss industry—is more than simply a nice-to-have. Competitiveness means a manufacturing industry that stays in Switzerland and doesn’t delocalize abroad. It also means developing—and keeping—powerful R&D capabilities and world-class engineering prowess in the country. Our broad field of expertise—microtechnology—is a fundamental ingredient of Swiss industry and of the success of Swiss Made and the added value these strategies so obviously create.
Strategy—Making the difference
We position CSEM as the foremost national player in the field of technology transfer. In this way, we explore new means of collaborating with academia and the economy, creating conditions favorable for the technology transfer required by the industries of tomorrow:
Leveraging our excellence in integration and multidisciplinary research in the broad field of microtechnology in order to strengthen our differentiation.
Intensifying our collaboration with Swiss academia and Swiss research and technology organizations (RTOs).
Encouraging more entrepreneurs to create start-ups.
Strengthening our position at the European level, with the Heterogeneous Technology Alliance (HTA) as our preferred tool.
The disruptive microtechnology platforms we develop today—strengthening the "Swissness" of products and processes—will, tomorrow, help Swiss industry maintain its leadership, creating wealth and jobs in the process.
