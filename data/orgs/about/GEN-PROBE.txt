Our solutions provide long-lasting relief for women facing gynecologic conditions that affect their uterine health and well-being. While science and technology drive our treatments, restoring women’s quality of life is our goal.

Our NovaSure® endometrial ablation procedure is minimally invasive and proven to return more than 75% of patients followed for three years to normal, light or no periods at all.2 Already performed 2.5 million times worldwide, it is the ideal treatment option for women suffering from AUB who have completed their childbearing years.   
We expanded our family of minimally invasive GYN surgical products with our MyoSure® tissue removal suite. Hologic offers a suite of MyoSure devices to resect and remove tissue, including a range of fibroids and polyps. Our suite of MyoSure products, including the MyoSure LITE device, MyoSure XL device, MyoSure REACH device and MyoSure MANUAL device, is ideal for women who still may want to have children.
The Path Ahead
Hologic is shaping the future of gynecologic health so that women no longer need to suffer in silence or alter their activities to accommodate emotionally stressful, painful – even life-altering – gynecologic medical conditions.

Breast & Skeletal Health Solutions
The Hologic Breast and Skeletal Health Solutions division strives to advance early detection, 
more certain diagnoses and accurate treatment. 
Transforming 
Breast & Skeletal Care
The Hologic Breast & Skeletal Health Solutions division strives to advance early detection, more certain diagnoses and accurate and compassionate treatment. 
At Hologic, we apply cutting-edge science to accelerate discovery, improve efficiency and continually sharpen precision. 
For women facing breast cancer, Hologic is there from screening through treatment 
with technologies that advance early detection and the highest quality interventional products when necessary. 
Our Genius 3D™ Mammography™ exam,* offered through our Selenia® Dimensions® system, finds 20%-65% more invasive breast cancers compared to 2D alone.
1
 It also reduces callbacks by up to 40% compared to 2D alone.
2
 Along with our other products, it reflects our ongoing drive to introduce innovations that bring greater certainty 
and
 peace of mind to both patients and the healthcare professionals who care for them.
With osteoporosis causing more than 8.9 million fractures annually, early detection is key to keeping patients safe.
 That’s why we ensure that our clinical images enable doctors to see more, so they can make more informed diagnoses and treatment decisions in time to have a positive impact on every patient’s health and well-being. 
We set the gold standard for bone densitometry in 1987 with the first dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) system. Today, we continue to take bone health to new heights, with the Horizon® DXA platform, which assesses osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease and obesity. We’re raising the bar for fluoroscopy imaging as well, with our CMOS flat detector and its exclusive rotating capabilities.
* The Genius™ 3D Mammography™ exam (a.k.a. Genius™ exam) is acquired on the Hologic® 3D Mammography™ system and consists of a 2D and 3D™ image set, where the 2D image can be either an acquired 2D image or a 2D image generated from the 3D™ image set. 
The Genius™ exam is only available on the Hologic® 3D Mammography™ system. 
Please consult your physician for a full list of benefits and risks associated with mammography.
