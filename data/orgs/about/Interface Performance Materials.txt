Let's Talk Performance
At Interface Performance Materials, performance plays into everything we do. That's because we take our customers' success personally — working collaboratively to match our expertise in materials science with their precise needs to provide materials that are engineered with performance that endures. We serve as the partner for performance. That means we are more than an expert and more than a preferred source for technically reliable solutions. We are a trusted advisor that applies materials science, engineering and polymer chemistry insights to a range of exciting new materials and products across rapidly evolving market opportunities.
Delivering Value
Our value is rooted in a rich heritage of technical innovation, production expertise and product excellence that were the hallmarks of the businesses that now comprise Interface Performance Materials. Today, that value is significantly enhanced by our core competency in applying materials science and polymer chemistry to create the best solutions for our customers’ specific applications. Our goal is to help customers achieve target cost while managing design requirements for optimum long-term performance.
A History of Innovation
As early as 1911, we were building a reputation for technical excellence and reliable products that met target costs. In the late 1970s, we developed the world's first non-asbestos soft gasket materials and by 1988 had converted our entire product line to non-asbestos materials.
Similarly, over the past 70 years, predecessor companies to our specialty papers business have rolled out a host of product improvements based on innovative production techniques. For example, they improved the durability of felt backing for flooring and the reliability of electrical barrier and insulation materials. They also developed higher density thermal millboard as well as more resilient matrix and backer boards for flexographic printing.
In the early 1990s, we developed MicroPore® technology, which greatly improved gasket sealability and durability. Later that decade, enhanced MicroPore materials were developed and tailored to specific applications and markets.
One of the latest innovations to come from this long history of expertise in materials science and innovative production methods is Select-a-Seal®. It employs a rubber-edge (polymer) on a composite body to create a first-of-its-kind sealing system that is proving more durable and robust than competitive technologies.
Our Continuing Technical Tradition
Select-a-Seal is one of the latest but certainly will not be the last product to result from our technical tradition. We have intensified our focus on practical solutions. Our investments in research and development continue to result in unique products engineered to meet specific industry needs. A global business, Interface Performance Materials offers one of the broadest product lines available, including:
Gasket products for automotive, heavy-duty and industrial markets
Thermal barriers for high temperature applications
Electrical barriers for appliances, lamps, computers and power tools
Board materials — the product of choice for securities and currencies printers worldwide
A Commitment to Research & Development
Our technical representatives participate with customers as part of development teams that help to optimize product performance while minimizing production costs. We take a predictive approach to the product development process: first, we define the performance requirements, then we work with the customer to create a product to meet those requirements.
Whether we are working to create a new gasketing product or an advanced specialty-paper application, in a typical development process our scientists, chemists and applications engineers bring their collective skills to bear on a customer’s specific needs. We identify a precise combination of materials — composites, fibers, fillers, polymer binders, etc. — that meet the requirements of a specific application. This preliminary work allows us to design quality into a product even before trial production begins.
Next, when appropriate, we verify performance under simulated or actual operating conditions using prototypes prepared under controlled conditions. This step enables us to learn how the given combination of ingredients will function together as a product. Often, formulas are tested at our state-of-the-art, 25,000-sq.-ft. Technical Center in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. It is a dedicated facility for materials testing and development in which researchers can duplicate our production facilities’ manufacturing processes on a small scale. In these instances, because of the small production runs, we can change formulas as necessary, shortening the development time and refining the materials until they meet our demanding performance criteria.
Environmental Policy
Interface Performance Materials is fully committed to maintaining strong policies that protect the environment by:
Complying with all applicable laws, regulations and other requirements concerning the protection of the environment.
Conducting our operations in a manner that prevents pollution. 
Ensuring that all of our materials and products are 100% asbestos free and 100% solvent free.
Utilizing a Continual Improvement process to benefit the environment and the community.
A Committed, Experienced Management Team
Our corporate management team members are experienced in the business segments they manage. They and the managers at each of our manufacturing sites share Interface Performance Materials' commitment to environmental stewardship and to customer satisfaction by developing quality products through quality processes.
Performance through Quality Assurance
Interface Performance Materials was founded on the concept of responsibility to the customer and a philosophy that quality comes first. Therefore, a commitment to quality underlies every one of the company’s research, production and business processes.
Our processes and products have been audited and meet the quality standards of leading customer quality programs worldwide. We use rigorous testing to simulate real world product performance and provide a quality certificate of performance on every shipment of materials. Technical experts have run thousands of hours of functional tests to validate our products’ quality performance and long-term durability. The result: robust solutions that perform reliably, and affordably satisfy the most stringent requirements.
