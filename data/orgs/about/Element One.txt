made by hand, not by machine.
… formed the company ELEMENT ONE in 2001, we have been concentrating on the flexible integration of high-quality retractable monitor technology in furniture and AV systems.
In our own factory…
… at the headquarters in Baden-Württemberg Kuppenheim, we continually work on the optimization of the innovative, patented mechanisms for the seamless embedding of monitors in the surfaces of tables and conference furniture. Selected components, precise, durable mechanics and an elegant design go hand in hand. We are also increasingly dedicating ourselves to the development and manufacturing of digital information signs and display solutions for presentation and sales rooms – and intelligent lifts for conference technology.
