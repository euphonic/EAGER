About us
E Solar offers tailored solution according to the client best interest and needs.From initial discovery through preclinical development to clinical trials, regulatory submission and product registration, we are harnessing world-class proprietary drug discovery platforms with the aim of halting the progression of Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases with innovative treatments and diagnostics.
The company’s novel tau aggregation inhibitors (TAIs) target the formation (aggregation) of tau protein ‘tangles’ in the brain. The spread of tau tangles – the main driver in Alzheimer’s disease – is strongly correlated with dementia and they can develop in the brain up to 20 years before symptoms associated with dementia develop. TAIs work by dissolving existing tau aggregates and preventing the further aggregation of tau protein from forming new tangles.
Our lead compound, LMTX®, inhibits aggregation of tau, synuclein, TPD-43 and huntingtin proteins. Patented as a novel chemical entity and chemically distinct from TauRx’s initial research compound, rember®, LMTX® has shown promise for slowing disease progression in Alzheimer’s disease and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia.
Three LMTX® Phase 3 clinical trials, conducted in over 20 countries and involving over 1,900 patients, have recently completed. For a summary of the programme and study results, please follow this link . 
Following these Phase 3 trials, TauRx has started a new clinical trial, named LUCIDITY. For further information, and to understand the eligibility criteria for the LUCIDITY trial, or to find a site close to you, please use the following link: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03446001?term=TRX0237&rank=5
TauRx and LMTXWhat We Do
Kinetech Power Systems (KPS) has developed a low-cost, flexible duration  - long or short - flywheel energy storage system (FESS), also known as a mechanical battery, that provides non-toxic, environmentally friendly power for up to 30 years with little maintenance required.
How We Do It
Constant innovation and hard work are behind our FESS. We've managed to create our own technology and designs for our high speed hybrid composite flywheel system, which allows us to drive our costs down without sacrificing efficiency. 
Why We Do It
We strongly believe energy storage to be essential for more widespread renewable energy adoption. We are committed to the development of technology that can put us all one step closer to a clean future for all generations to come.
Our Core Technology and Key Advantages
Innovative FESS Design
Our patented FESS design has been tested and proven to provide long duration energy delivery in several prototype systems. KPS is constantly developing new innovations to further our technology and its applications.
High Speed / Small Volume
KPS's high speed hybrid composite carbon fibre flywheel is much smaller than other similar steel flywheels, decreasing instalation costs and making it suitable for commercial and residential applications.
Unique Bearing Technology
The RingLube™ bearing technology is an efficient alternative to magnetic bearing systems without suffering from standby power losses.
Efficient
Clean
Secure
Telecom
Telecom flywheel energy storage backup systems that can operate outdoors at low and high temperatures with minimal O&M.
Utilities + Renewables
Flexible and fast responsive energy storage for frequency regulation, peak management, T&D deferral and renewables intregration.

We would love to hear from you. Click the button below to get in touch.Atomera Incorporated is a semiconductor materials and intellectual property licensing company focused on deploying its proprietary technology into the $350+ billion semiconductor industry.
Previously known as Mears Technologies, the company was founded in 2001 by Robert Mears with a vision to develop a platform of materials technologies for use across multiple industries.  In response to the slowdown in the advancement of Moore’s Law, Atomera used atomic level material science to develop Mears Silicon Technology™ (MST®) which provides multiple benefits to industry participants.  For semiconductor designers MST® improves performance and power efficiency while potentially reducing cost.  For semiconductor fabs, the technology may allow them to extend the life of their expensive manufacturing facilities by providing a new, unexpected suite of material improvements within existing process nodes.
After several years of research to perfect the technology, Atomera is now engaged with leading semiconductor companies to integrate MST® into their manufacturing flow.  On August 5, 2016, Atomera completed an initial public offering and trades on the Nasdaq stock exchange using the ticker symbol ATOM.

Career Opportunities
Sion Power is a rapidly growing company with technology that will revolutionize the rechargeable battery industry. We offer competitive compensation, benefits and exciting career opportunities.
Name
This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.We are scientists, consultants, collaborators, plant breeders, greenhouse assistants, agricultural economists, forage agronomists, beef producers, soils and crops specialists, wildlife biologists, biochemists, mycologists, genomicists, community members, teachers, life-long learners.
Nearly 400 of us come together from 20-plus countries to work at Noble Research Institute headquarters in Ardmore, Oklahoma, and research farms in the surrounding area, to carry out the vision of Lloyd Noble.
Just like Noble, we hold a deep appreciation for agriculture and the people who produce our food. We combine our various backgrounds and expertise to find solutions to problems faced by farmers and ranchers. This, we believe, will produce lasting benefits for all mankind and the natural resources upon which we depend.
Our activities are organized into four interconnected areas:
Research
We focus on research that will help farmers and ranchers improve land stewardship and productivity regionally, nationally and internationally. Our approach considers all spectrums of agricultural research, including the basic, translational and applied. We study the basic molecular and genetic levels of how plants grow and interact with the microbial world around them, develop stronger plants more tolerant to drought and resistant against diseases and pests, and evaluate how well cattle perform in various grazing systems.
Producer Relations
We keep the heart of agriculture – its farmers, ranchers and other land stewards – at the forefront of our activities. They are our friends and neighbors, and we help them meet their goals through one-on-one, no-cost consultation. These relationships keep us connected to real-life producer needs so research remains focused on answering relevant, pressing questions. We also provide leadership and training for other agricultural organizations so that together we can better serve agriculture.
Applied Agricultural Systems Research and Technology
We are producers, too. We live out what we teach, and we know challenges facing agriculture first-hand. We raise forage-based beef cattle, grow horticultural crops like pecans, and manage natural resources on seven research and demonstration farms that span 14,000 acres of southern Oklahoma. These farms provide a place for researchers to apply their work in a real-world environment. Producers can also visit our farms to see innovation in action.
Education
We share our knowledge and expertise, including what we've learned from our research, with students of all ages. We host adult agricultural seminars and workshops related to cattle, forages, natural resources and economics. We also foster an awareness and appreciation for agriculture in the next generation, our future problem-solvers. We offer a variety of interactive learning opportunities, including tours and internships.We are Synthetic Biology

The result: precise engineering of any measurable property in any protein so that it fulfills the exact functional criteria needed for commercialization. The proprietary VectorGPS® technology uses Design-of-Experiment (DoE) algorithms to build testable numbers of vectors from sets of control elements, and advanced machine learning to assess the contribution of each element to vector performance; resulting in custom vectors engineered precisely for individual proteins and expression systems.
While leading the industry in creating value-added applications through protein engineering, vector design and gene synthesis, ATUM has also chosen to emphasize customer service as a critical measure of success. The freely available ATUM software tool  Gene Designer  and the online DNA ATLAS , put all the tools and expertise needed for DNA sequence management and design at the fingertips of the user. The company positions itself as a resource and research partner for its customers, to enable accurate and innovative delivery of specific, immediately useful solutions.

About Us
Global Solar Water Power Systems does business globally, and is an offshoot of Mark Snyder Electric . For more than three decades, Mark’s electrical contracting          company has specialized in alternative energy technology, designing, installing          and servicing systems in southern California.
Mark is an internationally recognized authority on alternative energy, a master          electrician, a commercial organic farmer, and a community activist. He is also          the inventor of patented energy saving innovations.
Mark          Snyder
In 1985, Mark developed one of California's first large scale bio energy          conversion projects, producing electric power from agricultural waste.
Mark was selected by the Clinton Administration to serve on a White House          Council addressing the needs of our National Electrical Infrastructure in          anticipation of the Year 2000 Conversion.
As co-founder of Clean Air USA, he partnered with Willie Nelson Biodiesel to          bring clean alternative fuel to California in 2006.
Inventory of Completed Mobile Filtration Units
Global Solar Water Power Systems (GSWPS) and its partner company, Enertopia , are working to establish a          comprehensive water sanitation program in Haiti. Enertopia is a Canadian company          specializing in the application of both proven and new clean energy and clean          water technologies.
GSWPS has also partnered with Providence Trade and Development to bring GSWPS innovations to a broad          market.
Global Solar Water Power Systems (GSWPS) is currently working with Navajo leaders to provide clean water, clean power, communications and self-sufficient          off-the-grid housing to tribal lands in northern Arizona.
With a capable and dedicated staff, Global Solar Water Power Systems continues          to produce intelligent solutions to big problems. Look for more innovations to          come.

Copyright © 2011-2012 by Global Solar Water Power Systems, Inc., all rights reserved.               Acorn Technologies develops foundational building blocks for designing today’s advanced semiconductors and systems.
With a special focus on wireless communications and mobile computing, the company offers a unique portfolio of patent-protected and licensable IP cores and scalable semiconductor process technologies that enable significantly better IC and system performance, processing power, speed and throughput.
Acorn helps semiconductor manufacturers and chip design companies overcome technology bottlenecks to achieve their performance goals for advanced ICs used in next-generation devices.
The company also serves the telecommunications system developer with IP cores, algorithms and other IP solutions for mobile, computing and wireless networking, helping them to address the demanding needs of an increasingly connected world.Innovation
Innovation and the ability to solve tough challenges are at the core of Acorn’s customer value. We anticipate, identify and solve problems that often lie as much as a decade ahead on industry roadmaps, and have fostered a longstanding culture of innovation.
Our heritage of innovation is reflected in a team of experts and scientists whose long list of inventions are significantly impacting so many aspects of modern daily life. We have created an environment where we have access to some of the leading technical experts and business leaders in our chosen fields. Innovating over a long time horizon requires access to those that have the long term global view of technical design and development trends and a deep understanding of which challenges are worth focusing on.
For example in the Telecom field, our earliest work was on WiMAX solutions, which is now important for LTE networks, and we correctly anticipated the post Bulk Planar transistor architecture that since the 1970s has served as the basis for all semiconductor design. Today, our technologies apply to all types of transistor architectures, and our semiconductor strain innovations deliver a performance boost not only for future FDSOI low-power ICs, but also for devices manufactured using legacy semiconductor manufacturing nodes (the bulk of semiconductor manufacturing for many years to come).
One of our primary focus areas is solving the problem of today’s silicon chips with inefficient semiconductor transistor contacts — the industry’s biggest performance issue at 14 nm technologies and below. We have also developed IP cores and other technology innovations that solve key performance problems in 3G and 4G networks, while contributing to leaps in computational performance and spectral efficiency.Login

The man. The mind. the making of kulite.
Father of Invention
Teacher and mentor
Dr. Anthony D. Kurtz wasn’t asking for much. He simply wanted to create a high-tech company that would be recognized as the worldwide expert in its field. He got exactly what he wanted. And more.
After receiving his undergraduate and doctoral degrees in Physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dr. Kurtz worked in an MIT lab and later for Honeywell in Boston. He moved home to New Jersey in 1959 to start Kulite which went on to became the global leader in transducer technology.
Dr. Kurtz had the sense of a scientist, the mind of an entrepreneur and the heart to bring the two worlds together. Instilling basic core values in the company helped make Kulite the success it is today.
Believing deeply in the importance of education, Dr. Kurtz forged strong working relationships with top schools such as Oxford University, MIT and Columbia University, encouraged his employees to take college courses for which the company would pay and instituted a scholarship program for employees’ children.
Dr. Kurtz was a big advocate of hiring for life. He recognized the inherent value that all ages brought to the table. Older employees imparted their wisdom while the younger shared their vitality. People came to Kulite and stayed, some for 10, 20 or even 40 years. And, even as the company expanded to over 800 employees, Dr. Kurtz maintained his hands-on approach, calling nearly every person by name.
Dr. Kurtz passed away in 2010, leaving his legacy to his wife, Nora Kurtz, who now runs the business with the same sensibilities and smarts on which it was founded.
Kulite, which boasts over 350 patents, has become synonymous for ultra-miniature high accuracy pressure transducers. Kulite has designed transducers that measure traffic, measure and control equipment on naval and commercial ships, measure tire pressure in-flight of commercial airliners like the Boeing 747, are used in oil exploration, in coal mining and in determining the height of weather balloons. Kulite is the world’s largest supplier of aerospace transducers.
Simply put, whenever pressure or force needs to be measured, Kulite comes up with a solution to the problem, providing the best and most reliable method to make the measurement.
And, that’s exactly the Kulite that Dr. Kurtz envisioned.

We teach crops how to fight more plant diseases
At 2Blades, we pursue a better understanding of plant pathogens and the best solutions to the diseases they cause. The insights we find, which are at times unexpected or difficult to predict, provide new strategies for keeping plants healthy. 
2Blades works to apply these innovations to the breeding of significant crops for commercial and subsistence agriculture. We seek to get these healthier plants into the hands of farmers all over the world, so that farmers can stop losing crops to disease and can grow more efficiently with less need for crop protection chemicals.
Fighting crop disease is an important part of a sustainable system for producing food now and in the future, as the world works to feed more people and conserve our natural resources.
Our History
2Blades was established in 2004 as a 501(c)3 charitable organization to implement practical uses of important innovations in plant science that address the rising incidence of crop disease.  
Remarkable advances have been realized in plant science over the past twenty years, including genome sequencing, molecular marker technologies, and tools for genome engineering.  These advances have vastly improved the understanding of plants and their interaction with pathogens, and they create opportunities for better means of breeding for durable disease resistance.  Yet typically these opportunities have stalled at the basic research stage.
      “Technology transfer from lab bench to marketplace has historically been underdeveloped within the agricultural research enterprise.”  President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, The White House
Working together with world leading scientists in plant-pathogen interactions, 2Blades has scouted and supported the most significant advances in the understanding of plant disease and immunity, as well as enabling technologies to develop disease resistant crops.

About Solarreserve
SolarReserve is a leading global developer of utility-scale solar power projects, which include electricity generation by solar thermal energy and photovoltaic panels. In addition, SolarReserve has commercialized a proprietary advanced solar thermal technology with integrated energy storage that solves the intermittency issues experienced with other renewable energy sources. This proven US-developed technology generates renewable baseload and dispatchable power and can compete with traditional fossil-fired and nuclear electricity generation. The company currently has more than $1.8 billion of projects in operation worldwide, with development and long-term power contracts for 775 megawatts (MW) of solar projects representing $3.4 billion of project capital.
CEO, KEVIN SMITH
Q&A with CEO Kevin Smith
Watch Now
The global demand for renewable energy generation is expected to grow by 45% by 2020 which would require over $1.1 trillion of additional investment 
1
, after global investments topped $270 billion in 2014. As renewable energy penetration grows, the need for utility-scale renewable generation with storage technology is increasingly important to mitigate intermittency problems, deliver power into peak demand periods, and support transmission system reliability.
Since the company's formation in early 2008, SolarReserve's experienced team of power project professionals has assembled an extensive global development pipeline of 8 gigawatts (GW) across the world's most attractive, high growth renewable energy markets. The robust portfolio is strategically positioned to secure power offtake contracts, and includes advanced solar thermal technology (Concentrating Solar Power or “CSP”), photovoltaic (PV) technology, and hybrid (combined CSP and PV). SolarReserve’s hybrid CSP/PV solutions eliminate the intermittency issues associated with PV-only projects while providing cost efficient and reliable electricity generation.
SolarReserve is headquartered in Santa Monica, California, and maintains a global presence with five international offices strategically located in Africa, the Americas, the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East to support its widespread project development activities across more than 20 countries. The experienced management team has a proven track record of success in the energy infrastructure sector with over 27 GW and $48 billion of transaction experience in 25 countries. The company deploys the full spectrum of development, engineering, finance, project management, operation and maintenance, and product development expertise.

 We take responsibility 
For us, sustainability means securing the company’s long-term success while at the same time protecting the natural resources on which present and future generations depend. Ecology is thus a driver of innovation. At the same time, we demonstrate a particularly high level of corporate social responsibility — both within the company and beyond.
Sustainability at Bosch
 Hand in hand: entrepreneurial thinking and social commitment 
As a privately owned company, we act independently of the stock markets. Through Robert Bosch Stiftung, a charitable foundation, our profits are used to benefit society, the environment, and future generations — sustainably and for the long-term.
Ownership structure and organization
 Our history 
In 1886, Robert Bosch founded the “Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering” in Stuttgart. This was the birth of today‘s globally operating company. Right from the start, it was characterized by innovative strength and social commitment.

ATUM is the leading bioengineering solutions provider. Founded in 2003, ATUM (formerly DNA2.0®) offers an integrated pipeline of solutions for the research community, including platforms for protein and vector engineering, products such as expression vectors, fluorescent and chromogenic proteins, cell strains and reagents, as well as gene design, optimization, synthesis and cloning. ATUM is based in the US, with a global customer base encompassing academia, government and the pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural and biotechnology industries. ATUM is by far the most published synthetic biology vendor, providing expert support to and collaboration with scientists. The company is privately held and is headquartered in Newark, California
With a reverence for the interplay between science, technology and nature, ATUM has developed a unique engineering platform based on machine learning and Design of Experiment (DoE).  The ProteinGPS®  proprietary protein engineering technology uses megadimensional, empirical optimization processes to calculate the set of nodes that are information-rich in the relevant space, gene synthesis to make those exact sequences, and machine learning to find the preferred solution. The result: precise engineering of any measurable property in any protein so that it fulfills the exact functional criteria needed for commercialization. The proprietary VectorGPS® technology uses Design-of-Experiment (DoE) algorithms to build testable numbers of vectors from sets of control elements, and advanced machine learning to assess the contribution of each element to vector performance; resulting in custom vectors engineered precisely for individual proteins and expression systems.
While leading the industry in creating value-added applications through protein engineering, vector design and gene synthesis, ATUM has also chosen to emphasize customer service as a critical measure of success. The freely available ATUM software tool  Gene Designer  and the online DNA ATLAS , put all the tools and expertise needed for DNA sequence management and design at the fingertips of the user. The company positions itself as a resource and research partner for its customers, to enable accurate and innovative delivery of specific, immediately useful solutions. Customers value the individual, Ph.D.-level support they receive from ATUM’s sales and support staff, as well as the speed, accuracy, and flexibility with which products and services are delivered.

On 19 December 2018 we announced our agreement with Pfizer to form a new world-leading Consumer Healthcare Joint Venture. Within 3 years of the closing of the transaction, we intend to separate the Joint Venture via a demerger. With our future intention to separate, the transaction also presents a clear pathway forward for us to create a new global Pharmaceuticals/Vaccines company, and a new world-leading Consumer Healthcare company.

About us
Vaccines
Vaccines
Our Vaccines business has a broad portfolio and innovative pipeline of vaccines to protect people of all ages. We deliver over two million vaccine doses per day to people living in over 160 countries.
The vaccines in our portfolio have been helping to protect people from serious disease for well over 100 years, with our Marietta (US) site dedicated to smallpox vaccine production since 1882.  Today, our vaccines continue to tackle some of the world’s most devastating diseases, including pneumococcal disease, meningitis, hepatitis, rotavirus, whooping cough and influenza.
View video on YouTube
Our Vaccines business has a portfolio of more than 40 vaccines for every stage of life, helping to protect people against 22 diseases. We have a pipeline of 14 candidate vaccines in development. One third of our vaccines in development target diseases particularly prevalent in the developing world, including all three WHO infectious disease priorities: HIV, malaria and TB. Our other vaccines in development include vaccines for the treatment of COPD and prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). In October 2017, our shingles vaccine, Shingrix, received regulatory approval in Canada and the US.
The business generated sales of £5.2 billion in 2017, representing 17% of the total turnover of the Group.
Our marketplace 
Vaccination is recognised worldwide as one of the best investments that any government or healthcare organisation can make. In 2012, the WHO and its 194 member’s states published an action plan on vaccination to extend access to immunization to everyone in the world, promote innovation in the vaccines industry and prevent millions of deaths.
This plan involves more equitable access to existing vaccines for people in all communities, the introduction of new and improved vaccines and accelerated research and development for the next generation of vaccines and technologies. Overall, this should translate into a growing global demand for vaccines over the next 10-15 years.
For example, more than 25 million children are born every year in India alone and it’s estimated that by 2020 there will be more than a billion people in the world aged over 60.
Fighting malaria
GSK and Comic Relief: Joining forces to fight malaria.
Comic Relief and GSK form a partnership to fight malaria 
Our strategy
Our strategy is to bring differentiated, high-quality, and needed vaccines to as many people as possible.
To do this we focus on creating a strong patient and payer focused pipeline, maintaining valuable partnerships with our local operating countries, and ensuring sustainable access and affordability. 
70%
of our vaccines go to emerging markets
$12bn
Malaria related illnesses and mortality estimated by WHO to cost Africa's economy up to $12bn a year
Quality and manufacturing
In 2017, we sold more than 798 million doses of vaccine around the world. These are made in one of our 16 manufacturing sites located around the world. For some of our vaccines, this production process can take up to two years.
On average, each batch of vaccine will have undergone more than 100 quality checks before it is sent out, to ensure the vaccines meet world-class standards. Each of our vaccines is produced to the same quality standard, regardless of where in the world the vaccine will be used. 
We are continuously investing in our manufacturing facilities, improving our processes and building partnerships to ensure we meet the global growing needs for high quality vaccines.
Research and collaboration
Innovation is the beating heart of our business. Without it, there will be no new vaccines for the many diseases that still threaten individuals, families and communities around the world.
Our R&D organisation brings together expertise in virology, bacterial infection and different adjuvant platforms.  We now have three global R&D hubs: Rockville, USA (new in 2015); Rixensart, Belgium and Siena, Italy, which are focused on discovering and developing novel vaccines across a range of pressing public health threats. Our efforts are concentrated on those possible vaccines which may offer significant improvements over existing options or target diseases for which no vaccines yet exist. 
Our approach is to make the most of our own expertise and experience, while at the same time forming complementary partnerships and alliances with others who bring different kinds of expertise. Our vision for the world, where everyone has access to the vaccines they need, depends on a steady supply of great ideas and brilliant science. We have much to offer and through collaboration we can achieve so much more.
For example, more than 90% of the vaccines in our pipeline are being developed in partnership with others. We have a long track record of collaborating with governments, healthcare providers, regulators, academic institutions, non-governmental organisations, vaccine producers and other key partners to tackle public health challenges around the world.

Our history
Our history
Beginning in 1715 with the opening of an apothecary shop in London, our story has always focused on innovation. From a selection of individual entrepreneurs to a global company of around 100,000 employees, we’ve developed a variety of medicines and healthcare products that form the foundations of today’s GSK.

Our Pharmaceuticals business has a broad portfolio of innovative and established medicines. We currently focus on developing new medicines in respiratory and HIV/infectious diseases, oncology and immuno-inflammation; with discovery research exploring these and other areas.
The business generated sales of £17.3 billion in 2017, representing 57% of the total turnover of the Group.
The business is made up of innovative and established medicines and holds leading market positions in respiratory disease and HIV. In our Pharmaceuticals R&D organisation, almost 80% of research spending focuses on two current therapy areas: respiratory and HIV/infectious diseases; and two potential areas: oncology and immuno-inflammation.
Our marketplace
The global pharmaceuticals market is vast. The US remains a priority market for growth with other key growth areas including emerging markets and Asia Pacific regions. 
This trend of increasing demand is expected to continue as the world’s population grows, economies in the emerging markets become more prosperous and global changes in lifestyles affect long-term health.
Our strategy
Janet Liberty, an COPD patient
Our strategy is to research and produce innovative, high-quality and needed medicines; making these as accessible as possible to countries at all levels of income and development. 
To do this we focus on creating a strong differentiated pipeline, leading in HIV and respiratory, and developing our presence in speciality therapy areas, including oncology and immuno-inflammation. 
Our Pharmaceuticals portfolio
Our portfolio is made up of innovative and established medicines and we have leading global positions in respiratory disease and HIV.
We have been a leader in respiratory disease for over 40 years and have a portfolio of mature products. In recent years, we have strengthened and broadened our respiratory portfolio with the addition of new medicines including an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) combination, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and LABA dual bronchodilator.
Our HIV business is managed through ViiV Healthcare, a global specialist company in HIV that we majority own, with Pfizer and Shionogi as shareholders. ViiV Healthcare is now a leading global company in HIV and has had significant recent success with regulatory approval and industry leading launches of new medicines. ViiV Healthcare has a number of other antiretroviral medicines in clinical development.
In addition to respiratory and HIV, we have a portfolio of other innovative pharmaceutical products for the treatment of conditions such as lupus, urology and anti-infectives.  
We also have an Established Products Portfolio (EPP) which includes mature medicines in the areas of anti-infectives, allergy, central nervous system, dermatology, respiratory and urology. These products are an important part of our Emerging Markets business where the GSK brand is an important differentiator.
The journey to discovering and developing new medicines is lengthy, expensive and subject to a high rate of failure. Learn more about 
how we discover new medicines
. 
We are exploring different approaches to promote – and speed up – innovation in our labs.  Having broken down the traditional, R&D model, our scientists now work in smaller units focused on specific areas of research. This encourages greater entrepreneurialism and accountability. These groups are tasked with seeking out the biological targets involved in disease and creating molecules or biopharmaceuticals that will ultimately become new medicines. 
We also know that we won’t discover everything inside our own labs and that we need to partner with other companies, academic institutions and research charities.  We currently have research collaborations with more than 1,500 external organisations.
We also recognise our responsibility to meet society’s expectations to invest in disease areas where the science is difficult or where the typical business model to reward innovation may not be relevant; one example being our 
antibiotics research
. We are also one of the few healthcare companies researching the World Health Organization’s three priority diseases - HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.
Other business areas
Vaccines
Our Vaccines business has a broad portfolio and innovative pipeline of vaccines to protect people of all ages. We deliver over two million vaccine doses per day to people living in over 160 countries.
Consumer Healthcare
Our Consumer Healthcare business develops and markets consumer preferred and expert recommended brands in the Oral health, Pain relief, Respiratory, Nutrition/gastro-intestinal and Skin health categories.

Corporate Brochure
SStarted first domestic mass production of gummed tape
“FUJI SHOKAI” was established in Sugamo, Tokyo in April 1927, and started production of gummed tape. Gummed tape is tape coated by a water-soluble adhesive on craft paper and is used by wetting the adhesive surface for attachments such as stamps. At that time, the demand expanded rapidly as the cardboard box replaced the wooden box.
This is the origin of the adhesive technology and the precision thin-film coating technology of our company. We started our business in earnest as “FUJI SHIKO CORPORATION*” in 1934 after we moved our base to Itabashi, Tokyo.
Company name was changed  to “FSK CORPORATION” in 1984.

Promoted to build the domestic business foundation
We built sales offices in major Japanese cities including Osaka, Nagoya, Sapporo, Sendai, and Fukuoka to respond to reconstruction demand after the war. At the same time, we established new domestic factories one after another, including the Tatsuno Plant (at that time called the “Kansai Plant”), which is the current main manufacturing base.
In 1960, we started manufacturing and sales of adhesive materials for seals and labels, which are our current major products. In addition, in 1962, we developed an automatic packaging machine (cardboard box automatic sealing machine) manufacturing department, and established in the industry a unique style that is the combination of “adhesive materials and related equipment” and that led us to today’s business.

The origins of the Lovelace research laboratories and the Lovelace Hospital occurred over a century ago. In part resulting from his frustration with the limited medical capabilities of his rural practice and in part through discussions at medical meetings with Drs. Will and Charlie Mayo (who established the Mayo clinic), Dr. Lovelace formed the dream of developing a multispecialty clinical center. In 1913, Dr. Lovelace moved to Albuquerque as a means of alleviating his tuberculosis symptoms.  There he established a successful private practice, became Medical Director for the New Mexico Division of the Santa Fe Railroad, and became actively involved with St. Joseph’s Hospital. The evolution of the Lovelace Clinic began as a partnership with Dr. Edgar Lassiter, who also sought respite from tuberculosis in New Mexico and who married Dr. Lovelace’s sister. The health of both physicians improved, and they had long, productive careers. The group practice expanded to become the Southwest’s first center of specialty medicine. The financially astute Dr. Lovelace acquired several properties that today comprise large sections of Albuquerque’s east side, including the Hoffmantown and Princess Jeanne developments and the land between Gibson Blvd. and Ridgecrest Dr., the site of today’s Lovelace headquarters.
Founder
William Randolph Lovelace II (Randy) grew up on his father’s ranches, but lived with his uncle in Albuquerque while attending high school. Sharing the nation’s fascination with the rapid development of aviation during the 1920s, he joined the Naval Reserve Officer’s Training Corps and received his pilot’s license while attending Washington University in St. Louis. He pursued a medical career in the footsteps of his uncle and received his M.D. from Harvard University in 1934. His outstanding surgical skills blossomed during a fellowship at the Mayo Clinic, and he was appointed Chief of Surgery within a few years. With the impending entry of the U.S. into World War II, the Mayo Clinic was asked to form a research unit to develop solutions to the physiological challenges associated with high-altitude flight. Randy found his talent and love for research in a merger of his natural curiosity, medical knowledge, and love of aviation by joining the unit as a commissioned officer and later becoming its Chief. The unit’s several advances made Randy widely known and respected throughout the military and civilian aviation communities. A personal feat demonstrated Randy’s zest for adventure and faith in scientific principles and consolidated his recognition as a leader in aviation medicine. Lives were being lost in attempts to parachute from wounded aircraft at high altitudes without the benefit of oxygen that was available on board to the crews. Randy proposed that high altitude evacuations might be accomplished using small personal oxygen bottles, but the military brass considered the approach too radical and unlikely to succeed. Denied official permission, Randy schemed to test the method himself. Locating willing accomplices, he jumped from a bomber at 40,200 feet with a small oxygen bottle taped to his leg (incredibly, his first parachute jump!). Despite being knocked unconscious when exiting the plane, he survived the surreptitious experiment and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross when the government finally acknowledged the feat and adopted the strategy. While at Harvard, Randy married Mary Moulton (whose father also came to Albuquerque to recover from tuberculosis), and two sons and the first of three daughters were born. Polio, rather than tuberculosis, was the major health scourge in the 1940s, and tragically, despite the best medical care available, both boys succumbed in quick succession in 1946. Stricken with grief, Randy and Mary returned to New Mexico to put their lives back together. The older Dr. Lovelace encouraged Randy to join his growing specialty clinic, and in 1947 Randy agreed on the condition that the clinic would be reorganized to pursue the triple paths of health care, research, and education similar to the Mayo model (no medical school then existed south of Denver between Dallas and Los Angeles). The nonprofit Lovelace Foundation for Medical Education and Research was thus formed.
Board
An exceptionally capable Board of Directors formed largely of outstanding business leaders and the Chairmanship of only two individuals during the Foundation’s first 40 years (Floyd Odlum and Robert O. Anderson) contributed to management stability and financial soundness. Under the astute and energetic guidance of “Uncle Doc” (as the older Dr. Lovelace was known beyond earshot) and Randy, the Foundation grew steadily in size and scope of activities through the 1950s. A new clinic facility was built at the Gibson-Ridgecrest location on the edge of town near the Veterans Administration hospital and airport, and Uncle Doc’s donation of land persuaded the Methodist Church to locate its new Bataan Memorial Hospital nearby. The medical staff and specialty care capabilities expanded, and additional research buildings were constructed. Although the Lovelace Clinic became a training ground for physicians, the organization ultimately assisted the University of New Mexico in establishing a medical school on campus.Together, the Lovelace Clinic and Bataan Hospital (which the Foundation purchased in 1969) were the sites of many medical firsts. It opened the state’s first intensive care unit, first virus laboratory, and first nuclear medicine laboratory; performed the state’s first kidney dialysis and open-heart surgery; and had the state’s first external fetal heart monitor. It also established several national and international firsts, including the first U.S. hospital having a heart-lung resuscitator, the nation’s first cystic fibrosis treatment center, the world’s first laminar flow “clean air” operating room, and the world’s first use of massive lung lavage to remove radioactive particles from a human lung. It also formed one of the nation’s earliest group health plans of the type that evolved into today’s health maintenance organizations. Faced with a challenging financial environment in the local and national health care field, a national movement toward insurance-based control of physician-patient relationships, and a need for capital investment in facilities, the Foundation sold its health care activities in the mid 1980s. Although continued use of the name “Lovelace” was granted as a condition of sale, the Lovelace Foundation became a wholly research organization at that time.Through the 1950s and 1960s, the Foundation’s research operations expanded in size, scope, and recognition in parallel with the advances of its health care activities. Randy’s interests and connections with the aviation community led to his establishing the nation’s premier center for aviation and space medicine research, and he recruited Dr. Clayton S. (Sam) White, a former naval flight surgeon, to develop and manage a broader research program. Physiological studies of commercial and military pilots led to an Air Force grant to develop a protocol for testing candidates for space flight. In 1959, under contract to the newly formed NASA, Lovelace tested 32 candidate pilots using a seven-day series of rigorous physiological and psychological tests, which culminated in selection of the seven Project Mercury astronauts. A lesser-known follow-up project demonstrated that women could pass the tests with approximately the same success rate as men, leading to the immediate inclusion of women in the Russian space program (the first U.S. woman flew into space 20 years later). Randy was appointed by President Johnson as Director of Space Medicine for NASA in 1964. Tragically, Randy, along with Mary, died in an accident when their chartered airplane crashed in the Colorado mountains in 1965. Their three daughters had not accompanied them, and the youngest, Jacqueline Lovelace Johnson, is the current Chair of the LRRI Board of Directors.
Location
Under Sam White’s direction, the Foundation’s research expanded into additional fields, key among which were studies of therapy for blast and shock injury to the lung and the health risks of inhaled radioactive particles. These activities involved large, multi-year federal projects, and required specialized facilities that could not be accommodated in the Foundation’s facilities in town. These projects were housed in government-owned facilities located on federal property adjacent to Albuquerque within what is now Kirtland Air Force Base (KAFB). Construction of the Fission Product Inhalation Laboratory began in 1962, and within two years, the program constituted one-half of the Foundation’s research funding. Under the guidance of Dr. Roger McClellan between 1965 and 1988, the facility and its staff developed into the world’s premier center for research on basic and applied inhalation toxicology. During the mid 1970s the facility was renamed the Inhalation Toxicology Research Institute (ITRI), and its scope of research expanded to encompass nonradioactive environmental and occupational air contaminants. The project developed much of the data on which estimates of health risks from lung irradiation are still based and resulted in numerous other advances in the understanding of lung biology and toxicology and health hazards from inhaled air contaminants. The Foundation created Lovelace Biomedical and Environmental Research Institute (LBERI) as a nonprofit subsidiary to operate the program.After Randy’s death and with the sale of the health care operations and associated facilities, the Foundation consolidated its non-ITRI research operations in a new building near the medical center, and research there focused on skin cancer, cell biology, immunology, imaging techniques, substance abuse, and the health sequelae of exposure to defoliant in the Viet Nam War. The Foundation also created Lovelace Scientific Resources as a for-profit subsidiary to foster new medical technologies and conduct human clinical trials of pharmaceuticals and other therapies.
Leadership
By the late 1980s, the Department of Energy-funded radiation program at the ITRI facility was largely completed and being phased out, raising the possibility of the facility’s closure. ITRI encompassed a unique combination of facilities and staff that could meet other federal and nonfederal research needs, but federal ownership of the facility severely limited its access by other sponsors. Under the direction of Dr. Joe Mauderly between 1989 and 1996, the organization fought successfully to maintain its core competencies, and federal permission was sought to preserve the national research resource by allowing Lovelace to use the facility for other research obtained through competitive funding. After lengthy negotiations, the government-owned facility was privatized by granting Lovelace a long-term lease for its use for other federal and nonfederal research. This provided an opportunity, for the first time in decades, to merge the diverse Lovelace research operations into a single administrative structure. The reorganized entity was named the Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, and the new President/CEO, Dr. Robert Rubin, launched an effort to build a financially independent research enterprise focused primarily on respiratory health issues — its greatest underlying strength.

Since the Company’s founding in 1897, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd. has continued to take on challenges to achieve a prosperous and dream-filled future. In late 19th century, Japan was still heavily dependent on expensive imported electric cables. Sumitomo Electric decided to break ground with the electric wire business for the benefit of the nation. Starting with the production of copper and silicon copper wires, the Company played an important role in supporting the development of Japanese industries, succeeding in the first domestic production of high-voltage underground cables and the production and installation of the world's longest submarine cables.
120 years have passed since then. With its belief in the great potential of "innovation," the Sumitomo Electric Group will continue to contribute to the development of Japan and the world, both today and in the future.
The year 2017 marks the 120th anniversary of the founding of Sumitomo Electric. From an electric wire and cable manufacturer in Osaka 120 years ago, we have grown into a global leading company in automotive, infocommunications, electronics, energy and industrial materials industry. Take a journey through time and find out more about the defining moments in our history.
HISTORY
Sumitomo Copper Rolling Works founded
Sumitomo Copper Rolling Works, which formed the basis of Sumitomo Electric Wire and Cable Works, the predecessor to Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd., was established in 1897.
The nation was experiencing a severe recession as a reaction to an entrepreneurial boom following the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895). In the wake of Sumitomo's acquisition of Japan Copper Manufacturing Co., Ltd. in March of this year,  Sumitomo Copper Rolling Works was established.
1911
Sumitomo Electric Wire and Cable Works established
Despite the remarkable development of the electric power business, the nation was still relied on imports for high-grade goods, and its technologies were immature. Lamenting the situation, Kankichi Yukawa, Director and Manager of Sumitomo Head Office, decided to further accelerate the electrical wire business to benefit both Sumitomo and the nation. In the fall of that year, Sumitomo Electric succeeded in the practical application of lead-coated power cables for the first time in Japan, demonstrating a further leap in technology. These cables were used for power transmission from Kyoto Dento's thermal power plant in Fushimi to Kyoto City.
1914
Developed trolley wire
In 1914, we developed trolley wires. The first delivery was made to Tokyo City (present-day Tokyo metropolis) in 1916. Since then, these trolley wires have been used in various railways in Japan (in recent years, in the Keihan Nakanoshima Line, Tokyo Metropolitan Nippori-Toneri Liner), as well as overseas in the Taiwan High Speed Rail, also known as Taiwan's bullet train.
1922
Manufactured and installed 21 km of submarine power cable, the world’s longest at that time

Manufactured and installed 21 km of submarine power cable, the world’s longest at that time
This major project started when Sumitomo’s copper mine refinery was relocated to the uninhabited island of Shisakajima in 1905. Much time and expense was incurred since coal used as fuel had to be transported by ship from Niihama each time, making it less economical to continue with thermal power generation on the island. A hydropower plant was located on the opposite shore of Besshi, where there was an abundance of power. However, it was a remote spot located more than 20 km away, and required underwater power transmission lines that were considered impossible with the technology of that time.
Sumitomo Electric held repeated negotiations on the installation of submarine cables with German and British electric wire companies but none of them guaranteed the outcomes of the construction because there were no such long-distance submarine transmission lines anywhere in the world (the only well-known long-distance lines at that time were submarine cables in San Francisco that were 7 km short and a submarine cable between Sweden and Denmark that was about 5 km).
This project required a 21-km line connecting Niihama in Ehime Prefecture to Shisakajima, and was the world's longest submarine transmission line at the time. After a series of hardships, including  severe storms and degradation of  cable insulation resistance, underwater installation work was carried out over 20 days.
1927
1929
Delivery of Japan's first cable capacitator to Nippon Electric Power Company, Limited.
1932
1940

1943
1945
Experienced four aerial bombings in WWII
Although the war had ended, plants had been hit hard by air strikes and were in a desperate situation. After expressing appreciation to the employees for all their past efforts, then-President Sadao Bekku said that Japan must now rebuild itself as a cultural nation, and that Sumitomo Electric's products are essential to achieving this, and therefore, the company must strive to manufacture products for achieving its mission in whatever form the company would take. In addition to electric wires, Sumitomo Electric also manufactured daily necessities, such as rubber boots, electric heaters, wire mesh, and hoes and other agricultural tools, using materials on hand.

1950
Typhoon Jane strikes Japan
Typhoon Jane was a large typhoon that hit Osaka in September 1950, inflicting damage with 336 people dead, 500,000 victims, and 15,000 houses collapsing mainly in the Kansai region. The western plant of Osaka Works was flooded by water.  Aluminum overhead transmission cables bound for India were submerged by floodwaters. Although the products could have been made usable by washing them, management decided to re-make them all, with no thought of gain. This clearly shows our traditional spirit of devoting ourselves wholeheartedly to supplying quality products and placing prime importance on reliability.
1951
Delivery of piano wire to Chosei Bridge (Nanao City, Ishikawa Prefecture), Japan's first PC bridge
Delivery of piano wire to Chosei Bridge (Nanao City, Ishikawa Prefecture), Japan's first PC bridge
The Chosei Bridge over the Misogi River, which flows through Nanao City in Ishikawa Prefecture, is Japan's first prestressed concrete (PC) bridge and was installed by Nanao Shipyard of East Japan Heavy Industries, the predecessor to P.S. Mitsubishi Construction Co., Ltd., in December 1951. Piano wire was supplied by Sumitomo Electric. The bridge was removed in flood control works carried out in 2001 and partially relocated to Kibo-no-Oka Park (Hope Park) on the outskirts of Nanao City. The bridge still continues to contribute to the community.
1954
1957
Succeeded in achieving domestic production Television broadcasting antennas
Trial broadcasting in Japan began in Tokyo in 1952. The following year, NHK Tokyo and Nippon Television Network Corporation launched TV stations in succession. However, facilities used in these early TV stations, including antennas and power cables, had all been imported.
Sumitomo Electric had been manufacturing antennas and electrical supply cables for the National Police Agency and Defense Agency. Based on these technologies, the Company began developing antennas and electrical supply cables for TV broadcasting with the cooperation of NHK Science & Technology Research Laboratories. In 1954, we delivered a copper pipe co-axial electrical supply cable to the NHK Nagoya Bureau, and in 1957, we successfully manufactured and put the entire antenna system at NHK Kokura Bureau into operation.
1962
Dywidag railway sleepers and air suspension for railway ties
Regular tracks are often visualized with wooden railway sleepers, but in the case of Dywidag sleepers adopted in the Tokaido Shinkansen, PC materials assumed this role in place of wood. Sumitomo Electric's Dywidag sleepers were adopted for use in the Tokaido Shinkansen in 1961, with full-fledged delivery starting in the following year.
For details about the Dywidag method, please refer to http://global-sei.com/company/sei-world/2015/09/feature.html
Since the start of research in 1955, we have developed air springs mainly for railway cars. In 1962, we developed a diaphragm air spring in cooperation with Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd. and supplied to private rail cars and bullet train cars. Later on, new air springs "Sumiride" were developed and delivered to many customers both inside and outside of Japan.

EXPO' 70
Provide power cables, steel cords for moving walkways and traffic game
A "Traffic Game," the main feature of the Automobile Pavilion at the Japan World Expo held in Osaka in 1970, was a one-of-a kind exhibition at the Expo venue, where visitors could enjoy taking part. In the game, colorful miniature cars ran on a grid-shaped track constructed in the circular square. The cars need to enter their opposite base and continues to cross back to their original base. If this circuit is successfully completed three times within two minutes, the driver received a souvenir gift. With 250,000 participants, the success rate was about 3%. The royal family, including the Crown Prince, also visited during that time.
In addition to this, our power cables and steel cords (used for moving walkways) played an important role at the Osaka Expo. Moving walkways spread across the country after the Expo.
1973
Joint experiments on bus location systems, a first in Japan
Joint experiments on bus location systems, a first in Japan
Joint experiments on bus location systems, a first in Japan
In addition to traffic control systems, we also developed a bus location system from the middle of 1970s to 1980s.
Road congestion was already a significant issue, and the poor punctuality of city buses had resulted in a visible decrease in users. The bus location system was examined as a countermeasure to address this issue and was introduced for the first time in Japan. Under the guidance of the Ministry of Transport, joint experiments were conducted with Sumitomo Electric in charge of the development of equipment, and Tokyu Corporation in charge of operations. A demonstration plan was decided in 1971 and design and production began in June 1972. Demonstrations for each function were carried out from August 1973 to January 1974.
1974
●Completed the Tokyo Traffic Control Center, one of world's largest
●Started production of optical fiber cables
1976
1980

Parallel wires are giant-sized suspension materials used for large suspension bridges and cable-stayed bridges. With manufacturing starting in 1980 for Onaruto Bridge, these wires were also produced for the Kita and Minami Bisan Seto Bridges, Akashi Kaikyo Bridge, and Kurushima-Kaikyo Bridge.
1982
●Started experimental production of intelligent robot with advanced awareness and judgment functions
●Produced one of the world's largest synthetic monocrystal diamonds (1.2 carats).
Produced one of the world's largest synthetic monocrystal diamonds (1.2 carats).
Produced one of the world's largest synthetic monocrystal diamonds (1.2 carats).
In 1970, we began research on synthetic diamonds. As a manufacturer of cemented carbide, we had numerous requests to produce ultra-high-pressure products, such as diamonds, but we had no technical basis with which to do so. Two-axis machining equipment was not available anywhere in Japan and  equipment from overseas was every expensive. Therefore, we started to research ultra-high-pressure technology from zero by ourselves.
In 1982, we succeeded in manufacturing a 1.2-carat, single crystal diamond, which was included in the 1984 version of the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's largest synthetic diamond at that time. Crystals had a yellow hue due to the influence of impurities, but now clear and colorless high-quality crystals of about 10 carats are available.
Sumicrystal, synthetic single crystal diamond
Opening of Kansai International Airport (provide comprehensive communications network system, contact power cable support and prestressed steel for paving)
Construction work on Kansai International Airport began in January 1987. Sumitomo Electric was responsible for the construction of roads and railways, electrical power supply to the airport, paved PC steel materials for parking lots, information infrastructure, and integrated communication systems. Specifically, our PC steel products are used in airport roads, including the Japan Highway Public Corporation's Kansai International Airport Line and Hanwa Expressway, as well as the Hanshin Expressway Wangan Route, in addition to elevated bridges and orbital concrete sleepers for the Kansai International Airport Line on the JR and Nankai Electric Railway.
We also supplied LAN systems to connect individual information management systems for parking lots, facilities, and refueling, as well as POS systems installed in the airport island, thereby centralizing information and resources. Our products have also been adopted in cables and accessories for trunk power cables to the island and power distribution cables in control towers and employee accommodations.
1992
Started experiments on InGaAs crystal growth for the Space Shuttle Endeavour
Started experiments on InGaAs crystal growth for the Space Shuttle Endeavour
NASA's Space Shuttle Endeavor enabled a number of experiments that were difficult to conduct on the ground ("Fuwatto '92" project). One experiment tried to produce new ambitious materials by taking advantage of the features in outer space where substances with poor compatibility like oil and water will mix uniformly.
1998
2006
Started power transmission via superconducting cable in actual power transmission lines
A high-temperature superconducting cable manufactured by Sumitomo Electric was used for the practical application of underground power transmission cables for the first time in the world. In a superconducting cable project in Albany, U.S. SuperPower Inc. was the main contractor, National Grid supplied power cables, BOC (now Linde) conducted cooling, and Sumitomo Electric oversaw the manufacturing, installation, and operation of superconducting cables. A 350-m superconducting cable was constructed over 3.2 km between two substations in Albany City, and long-term power distribution demonstration was carried out using a real system.
Long-term power transmission demonstrations using actual grids were completed successfully in April 2008.
2010
Developed aluminum wiring harnesses
For wiring harnesses, copper wires are commonly used for the excellent electrical conductivity. However, in order to contribute to the reduction of vehicle weight, the Sumitomo Electric Group developed aluminum alloy wires that have a current conductivity equivalent to that of copper wires with half the weight of copper wires. Aluminum wiring harnesses using these electric wires have been sold since 2010.
Of the cars in the world, one in four uses Sumitomo Electric Group wiring harnesses.

Our History
PRG’s growth as a company has paralleled the development of modern technology in the live entertainment industry. Founded in 1982 by Jere Harris as Jeremiah J. Harris Associates, and later renamed Harris Production Services, the company was joined two years later by Scenic Technologies, founded to develop new scenic fabrication and automation techniques for the live entertainment market. Landmarks of those early years include the long-running musical production The Phantom of the Opera (1988), which featured the debut of the patented Stage Command® motion control system, and EFX (1995) at the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas, which was produced by Harris, and with a budget of $45 million, was one of the largest theatrical shows at the time.
Responding to growing customer requests for a one-stop production solution, Production Resource Group, L.L.C., (PRG) was established in 1995. PRG increased its capabilities over the next several years through a number of strategic acquisitions, including lighting and audio companies such as Vanco and Cinema Services (1996); Bash (1997); along with Production Arts Lighting and Promix (1998). The acquisitions of Light & Sound Design (1998) and VLPS® Lighting Services (2004) brought the teams responsible for many of the pioneering innovations in our industry, setting the stage for a series of industry-leading proprietary products that continue to set PRG apart today.
In 2009, PRG took a giant step forward into the global marketplace with the acquisition of PROCON, an entertainment technology company headquartered in Germany with offices in Belgium, France, Switzerland, China, and South Africa. This move has solidified PRG’s position as the premier resource in the entertainment and event technology industry, with a unique global brand and a strong presence and customer base in major markets and geographic locations worldwide.
The 2011 acquisition of First Events BVBA, expanded PRG’s European presence into new territories, including the Netherlands and Spain, as well as significantly reinforced their existing activities in Belgium. A major Europe-based entertainment technology company, First Event’s holdings included EML Productions NV in Belgium, EML Productions Holland BV in The Netherlands, and Sound and Light Productions S.L. in Spain. 
In 2014, PRG expanded into the Middle East when it acquired Dubai-based Gearhouse, L.L.C., the largest provider of turnkey event production services across the Gulf Region. 2015 kicked off with the acquisition of Chaos Visual Productions, which expanded the reach of PRG Nocturne and their expertise with live video production into more markets.
Today, PRG continues to lead the industry with the comprehensive integration of entertainment technology as represented by our work on productions such as Broadway’s Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark (2011). For this groundbreaking production, PRG provided the lighting, audio, video, and automation systems, as well as the construction of the massive scenery.  Spider-Man set a new standard for the total integration of production technology, which we continue to apply to every project. In 2013, PRG brought their technical expertise, especially in the area of scenic automation, when we collaborated closely with Global Creatures to bring King Kong to the stage in Australia. PRG, in 2014, partnered with Hero Ventures, when we brought our technical expertise to bear on The Marvel Experience, an unprecedented audience engagement that is a fully immersive experience that brings guests into Marvel's world of superheroes and villains. PRG has a legacy and a future of bringing the impossible to reality.

Our Values
Scientific Integrity
We apply scientific knowledge, methods and rigor to all BBI actions and decisions.
Quality
We focus on excellence in execution and significant results, rather than on action for the sake of activity.
Accountability
We don't settle for anything less than excellence, so we never fear the consequences of demanding excellence from ourselves or one another.Since its establishment in 1994, Bestway has devoted its efforts to strengthening  research, design, development, and the manufacturing of high quality and innovative outdoor leisure products. Bestway’s extensive range of products meet the needs of every consumer with inflatable stand up paddleboards, above ground pools, portable spas, flocked and fabric airbeds, as well as sports and leisure boats. In order to ensure customer satisfaction, every department in Bestway works closely to provide the best product solutions. This includes our technology centers, central laboratories, quality assurance centers, vertically integrated manufacturing systems, and our well-established after-sales service centers around the global.
Our Vision
To create fun, lasting experiences for everyone in the world through our products and services.
Happy Consumers
Creative and professional teams delivers innovative, functional and exceptional products with the goal of bringing fun and memorable user experiences to consumers.
Happy Employees
Create a work environment in which our employees can develop their skills, build their careers and cultivate and pursue their professional interests.
Happy World
Emphasis on corporate sustainability and aim to minimize the impact on the environment.  Actively investing in and pursuing more efficient alternative energy sources and material recycling initiatives.
Recycling
Whether post-production scraps or post-consumer returns, we collect all scrap PVC material. Using our in-house machinery, we sort, grind, wash and separate the returned products or process scraps into pellets which can be reused in our manufacturing.
We are committed to continuous improvement in technical knowledge, automation, and mechanization in the manufacturing system with an eye to always maximize our production efficiency.
Our manufacturing plant in Nantong boasts 23,000 square meters of solar panels, generating 4 million 700,000 kwh of electricity, equivalent to about 8% of our annual energy consumption at our Nantong plant. Plans to continue to expand the roof area for new installation of solar panels are in the works.
In 2016, we participated in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). Alongside 5,600 suppliers worldwide we reported our current energy use, carbon emissions and projects implemented to improve our company footprint. Bestway was awarded the "Best China Supplier" for our energy related efforts among 400 Chinese manufacturers who participated in CDP’s report and program. www.cdp.net
Bestway product safety compliance managers in Shanghai, Europe, and North America are actively involved with European and American Standards Committees.
We participate in drafting technical and safety standards for above ground pool and spas with the European Standardization Committee. Safety requirements for all of our products comply with international and regional laws and regulations, and obtain the test report and certifications issued by a qualified third party international professional testing organizations, such as GS, UL or ETL.
Our central laboratory in Shanghai has played a key role in ensuring the safety of our products. It has received a number of domestic and international accreditation and certifications such as:
• National Accreditation Board of China
• TÜV Rheinland group (International Electrotech nical Commission) customer testing laboratory for electrical product safety
• US Consumer Product Safety Commission's firewall third party testing laboratory
We have the only laboratory in China that has received all of the above approvals.
Retention
Happy employees are the driving force of Bestway’s successful operations. We value our employees and create an environment in which employees are able to develop their talents and pursue their professional passions. And it shows. This is especially true in China, where our manufacturing facilities are located in our sites in Shanghai, and Nantong and Yancheng in the Jiangsu province in the inland eastern region of China, all within driving distance of each other in the Yangtze River Delta region and within driving distance of each other along the same highway for efficiency and logistical purposes. Up until recently, it was the norm for Chinese workers to migrate to cities such as Shanghai and Beijing only to return inland to their homes for the Chinese New Year. This "tide of return" began after the 2009 financial crisis, during which approximately 20 million migrant workers found themselves without work and were forced to return home. Since then, stimulus packages including investment in inland transportation development and increases in employment opportunities have made large interior cities increasingly attractive places to work for people from those regions, since they no longer need to make the personal sacrifices of leaving their families too far behind. With these incentives in place, Bestway has attracted more employees to retain over the past five years. Add that to the important fact that Bestway believes in promoting from within and you have a recipe for successful and happy employees.
Broad Assortment of Products
Bestway is committed to the development, production, and sales of high quality and innovative sporting and leisure products. Our product range covers an abundance of different products to meet the needs of people from all walks of life. Trips to the beach, lazy days by the pool or a weekend in the mountains, fishing at the lake?  Bestway has everything in store for whatever you need. We are the ultimate solution to creating fun, lasting memories for you, your family and friends.  For more information on our products, click on each of the links below.
Solar Sustainability
In addition to recycling, Bestway utilizes one of the largest resources available to aid in creating more energy efficient manufacturing processes – the sun. Solar electricity is green, renewable, and doesn’t release any harmful carbon dioxide or other pollutants. We installed 23,000 square meters of solar panels in the rooftop of our manufacturing facility in Nantong, which generated 4.7 million kilowatt-hour of energy,which is equivalent to approximately 8 % of the annual energy consumption of our Nantong manufacturing facility. We plan to install 22,000 square meters of solar panels in our manufacturing facilities in Nantong by September 2017.
Sustainability
In 2016, we participated in a public disclosure program organized by Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP’) by reporting our sustainability efforts along with over 5,600 manufacturers globally, including information on energy use, emissions and wastes.
We were awarded the Best Chinese Supplier on climate change measures. Approximately 400 Chinese manufacturers participated in the program and reported their sustainability efforts, with over 5,625 companies responding in 2015. www.cdp.net .

Our innovation history
We have a 120-year track record of industry firsts. View our Global History.
First industrially manufactured medical X-ray unit
Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen discovers X-rays in November 1895. Both our legacy companies Siemens & Halske and Reiniger, Gebbert & Schall recognize the potential of this new technology for the field of medicine and start producing the first industrially manufactured X-ray systems. The one pictured above is the Röntgeneinrichtung (X-ray unit) by Siemens & Halske from 1896.
1956
CLINISTIX – first ever dry chemistry testing for glucose in urine
Our predecessor company Miles launches the first ever test strips called CLINISTIX. The new method proves to be simpler, more reliable, and faster than previous ways of testing for diabetes: results are available in 10 seconds. Soon the dip-and-read method becomes the preferred way for rapid testing and expands use to other conditions. Today, it is still the standard way to gain an overview when a patient presents with many symptoms.
With the help of their team, chemist Helen Murray and biochemist Alfred Free develop CLINISTIX. Their invention heavily impacts the further development of both laboratory diagnostics and point-of-care testing.

1957
AutoAnalyzer – fully automated discrete chemistry analyzer for whole blood or serum
The AutoAnalyzer accomplishes in one night what took lab technicians days. It consists of mechanical appliances, dialysis and analysis devices  − and a key innovation: The blood samples flow through the system continuously because they are separated by air bubbles. Deemed the prototype of all large central lab analysis systems, the AutoAnalyzer remains one of the most used automatic lab systems throughout the 1980s.
When biochemist Leonard Tucker Skeggs watches colleagues analyze blood samples by hand, he wonders: Can this be faster? Skeggs develops the first AutoAnalyzer prototype working at night in his home workshop. He creates one of the largest milestones in lab automatization.

1967
Vidoson – world’s first real-time ultrasound scanner
Having passed clinical tests in 1965/66, the world’s first real-time ultrasound imaging system comes to the market in 1967 under the name Vidoson. From this time on, ultrasound makes its way into hospitals and private practices as a diagnostic imaging method.
German engineer Richard Soldner (shown in the picture) and physicist Heinz Kresse begin developing this ultrasound system in the early 1960s.
1975
SIRETOM – our first CT scanner
1974, we exhibit our first tomographic image of a human head at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America in Chicago. A year later, we introduce SIRETOM, our first computed tomography (CT) scanner for the brain. A typical examination takes less than six minutes. The X-ray tube and a detector unit scan the skull from various directions, and an image of absorption distribution in the brain is generated in the computer.
In 1972, we set up a dedicated CT development department in Germany. Its founding fathers Friedrich Gudden, Gerhard Linke, Karlheinz Pauli, Benedikt Steinle, and Reiner Lieberuth develop the first SIRETOM CT scanner and grow the department steadily over the coming years.
1983
MAGNETOM – first Siemens MRI scanner
After years of R&D work, we present MAGNETOM, our first commercial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. That summer, the system is installed for the first time in the U.S. and Germany. With the aid of powerful magnetic fields, MRI scanners produce high-quality cross-sectional images without exposing patients to radiation. The sectional images display tissues and organs more clearly than ever before.
From 1978 on, a team led by Alexander Ganssen (r.) and Arnulf Oppelt develops the MRI scanner. The left picture shows Oppelt in front of the 0.1 Tesla prototype. The unit Tesla measures the magnetic field strength. Today, our MRIs in clinical use have of up to seven Tesla.
1986
Stable acridinium ester based chemiluminescence immunoassays
We invent the first stable acridinium ester based chemiluminescence molecule. Our acridinium ester is non-radioactive, stable, highly-sensitive. It is first used in commercial immunoassays in 1986. The acridinium ester molecule is very versatile, mainly because of its small size. Today, we hold about 40 patents on innovative acridinium ester molecules for advanced diagnostics of heart, liver, and thyroid disease.
1998
Our first track-based laboratory automation system ADVIA® Automation connects multiple laboratory analyzers in a single, consolidated, high-volume workstation. The fully automated system allows for multiple testing disciplines like clinical chemistry, immunoassay, hematology, hemostasis, coagulation and urinalysis and requires less sample tubes for analysis.
In 1997, the development team begins to apply the principle of ADVIA CentraLink® Data Management System, which consolidates data from multiple analyzers, to sample management on track-based automation. The system is first installed in Regensburg, Germany in late 1998.
1999
syngo – first intuitive medical IT platform from Siemens
Developed in 1999, the image processing software syngo facilitates medical examinations by providing a single user interface for a large number of imaging systems, like X-ray devices or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners. The software is used in hospitals and medical practices to generate and post-process images. It integrates patient-specific physiological and imaging data into clinical workflows.
From 1994 onwards, a dedicated team works on the development of a completely new IT platform for medical imaging. Computer scientist Karlheinz Dorn is the chief architect of syngo.
2001
In our innovative hybrid system Biograph, we combine positron emission tomography (PET) with computed tomography (CT): A PET scanner visualizes biological processes of life while an integrated CT system provides millimeter-precise anatomical images of tissues and organs. When they come together they reveal the complete picture: detailed anatomy and biological function at the molecular level.
Engineer Andres Sommer develops Biograph in collaboration with the PET team in Knoxville, TN, USA.
2005
SOMATOM Definition – world’s first Dual Source CT scanner
Two X-ray sources and detectors in one system: With twice the scanning power, we set new standards in image quality, scan speed, and spectral imaging. Dual Source technology enables the validation of coronary CT angiography with the potential to reduce the need to artificially lower the heart rate. Clinicians can now image the heart without motion artifacts at high heart rates or in cases of arrhythmia.
The “birth” of our Dual Source CT technology involves a team of dedicated physicists and engineers: Thomas Flohr, Herbert Bruder, Jürgen Simon, Stefan Schaller, Bernd Ohnesorge, and Bruno Dörrfuß, who is project lead for this system.
2006
Dimension Vista® 1500 system – first diagnostic analyzer integrating four technologies in one system
Our Dimension Vista® 1500 Intelligent Lab System launches as the industry's first ultra-integrated analyzer for high-volume clinical laboratories. Using four advanced detection technologies, the system provides laboratory personnel with the ability to efficiently perform a broad range of high-quality chemistry and immunochemistry tests on one analyzer.
2008
Artis zeego – robotic-assisted angiography system
We design Artis zeego to support surgical and interventional procedures. The flexible robotic stand allows for imaging in all surgical positions and brings faster workflows to the OR. The unique robotic technology enables 3D images for larger volumes to visualize large organs or long spines. Since 2008, minimally invasive treatments are on the rise and fixed C-arm systems like Artis zeego become more common in the Hybrid OR.
Typically, industry robots are separated by a fence to protect the operator. For the Artis zeego however, the robot had to work openly in a clinical environment. To master this challenging task, we closely work with Siemens’ robot-experienced Corporate Technology team.
2008
Ysio® – digital radiography, wireless flat panel detector
Our Ysio® can fully be customized; it’s a digital X-ray system for all clinical demands. A highlight is the wireless detector, wi-D. Detectors convert X-rays to digital image information. At that time, they are usually firmly integrated in the examination table. Ysio’s wi-D can be removed and placed directly underneath or next to the patient. Exposures that are difficult or impossible with an integrated detector can now be taken easily.
2009
syngo.via – multi-modality 3D imaging network
With syngo.via, our imaging software for reading of clinical cases across different modalities, we place special focus on reading efficiency. When calling up a cardiac CT case, for example, the software automatically removes the blood pool and ribs, selects an appropriate cardiac phase, and displays the images in the correct layout. The physician can immediately start reading the case.
To develop syngo.via, we use our in-depth knowledge of disease-specific reading processes and AI-powered post processing algorithms. Our team built a technology that offers the broadest portfolio of clinical applications for routine and advanced reading and reporting.
2011
Biograph mMR – the world’s first integrated, simultaneous whole-body MRI and PET
Our Biograph mMR is the first scanner to acquire MRI and PET data at the same time. Doctors can now see the position of organs, their functioning, and metabolic processes in a single image. This enables more accurate diagnosis and can allow for the early detection of many diseases accompanied by changes in cell metabolism. The hybrid system is especially useful in cancer diagnosis and for examinations of the nervous system and heart.
Biograph mMR is developed as part of a community project by our units for molecular imaging in the U.S. and magnetic resonance in Germany. To bring this modality to market, we join forces with medical and research institutions around the world.

2012
As the world’s first wireless ultrasound system, our ACUSON Freestyle™ facilitates the use in interventional radiology, anesthesiology, critical care, cath lab, or emergency care. It helps expand ultrasound into new applications, such as improving ultrasound-guided target localization in therapeutic interventions and biopsies.
To transmit the acquired ultrasound data directly to the screen, our team develops a new radio transmission protocol that’s able to simultaneously transmit data equivalent to ten of the – at that time – latest generation (4G) smart phones.
2014
SOMATOM Force – “Free breathing” CT scanning with dual X-ray sources & detectors
SOMATOM Force allows access to state-of-the-art computed tomography (CT) to the most sensitive patient groups such as small children or people with renal failure. Its scan speed of up to 74 centimeters per second is so high that it supports free breathing CT.
With SOMATOM Force, the third generation of our dual source CT scanners, the 600 people strong development team set new standards in computed tomography. SOMATOM Force is currently being used in a number of leading university hospitals across the globe.
2014
teamplay – cloud-based network
teamplay connects medical institutions and their imaging devices. The cloud-based solution with its apps monitors quantities such as imaging throughput or dose levels, utilization of staff, rooms and resources of the whole department down to every device and procedure, showing our customers where workflows need adjustments. And it links them to other users and their data to offer comparable benchmarks and exchange of images and reports.
teamplay started as a prototype at RSNA 2014 and has been constantly growing since. Today, clinical institutions in more than 45 countries transform their big data into smart data with teamplay.
2015
Mammomat Inspiration PRIME edition – wide-angle image acquisition breast tomosynthesis
Mammography screening means examining healthy women, so low dose and high image quality are key. Our Mammomat Inspiration PRIME edition delivers on that. And it comes with a special technology: Its tomosynthesis algorithm reconstructs multiple 2D images of the breast into an approximation of a 3D image. With that, doctors can better diagnose tumors that are hidden by overlapping breast tissue than with standard 2D digital mammography.
Thomas Mertelmeier (left) and his team develop both the PRIME (Progressive Reconstruction, Intelligently Minimizing Exposure) technology and tomosynthesis for our systems over years of research and in close collaboration with clinical partners.
2015
Multitom Rax – first Twin Robotic X-ray scanner for enhanced patient care and productivity
Our Multitom Rax enables the widest range of X-ray examinations with a single scanner in one room: 2D radiography, fluoroscopy, angiography, interventions, and 3D bone imaging. This is enabled by the two ceiling-mounted robotic arms, which ensure high-quality imaging. They automatically move around the patient, making examinations safer and more convenient; patient repositioning and transfers to other imaging rooms become obsolete.
2016
Liquid biopsy
A liquid biopsy is the sampling and analysis of non-solid biological tissue, primarily blood. It is mainly used as a diagnostic and monitoring tool for diseases such as cancer, with the added benefit of being largely non-invasive. With NEOliquid1 we offer a minimally-invasive cancer diagnostics blood test that can help doctors provide a precise diagnosis to guide individualized therapy.
1 The product (here mentioned) is not available in the U.S. for any use.  NEOliquid is CE-Marked for sale in the EU. Availability varies from country to country. Please contact NEO New Oncology GmbH for further details.
2017

© Smart Planet Technologies. All Rights Reserved.About armageddon energy
Armageddon Energy is a Silicon Valley solar startup that develops attractive, easy to install solar energy systems for consumers, the military and commercial microgrids, particularly in emerging markets. Armageddon Energy was one of the first solar companies to develop and commercialize a lightweight polymer solar panel using crystalline solar cells.  Armageddon Energy also developed an innovative rapid deployment racking system and site analysis software that enables anyone with a cell phone and a simple plastic device to instantly measure and analyze the potential of a customer site to produce solar energy.
Mark Goldman, Founder & CEo
With the help of some of Silicon Valley's finest sales strategists, product designers and materials and manufacturing experts, Mark founded Armageddon to help deliver on the full promise of solar, by developing products that fit the needs of the industry's most demanding customers, in particular mainstream consumer rooftops and remote microgrids.
Prior to Armageddon, Mark helped launch pioneering commercial solar finance provider Tioga Energy.  He also founded EtherSea Communications, a centralized text and voice messaging service provider, and PITO Networks, one of the earliest free file storage and sharing companies.
Early in his career, Mark had the great fortune of working in the Administration of President George H.W. Bush, serving in the White House Office of Cabinet Affairs, focusing on energy and security issues as a junior staffer, and at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, where he worked in the Administrator’s Office on special initiatives such as the launch of the Energy Star program and cap and trade for acid rain reduction.  Basic Policy of Management
The Sumitomo Electric Group, in accordance with the Sumitomo Spirit and the Sumitomo Electric Group Corporate Principles, shall strive to be a group of companies worthy of society's trust by conducting the business activities in an honest manner.
The Sumitomo Spirit
The Sumitomo Spirit grew out of the guiding principles set down by Sumitomo founder Masatomo Sumitomo in his "Monjuin Shiigaki" (the Aphorisms of Monjuin). This corporate spirit has been developed, deepened, and handed down over generations in the Sumitomo Family enterprise, and its essence was distilled in the Rules Governing the Sumitomo family established in 1882, and formulated into two business principles in 1891. Although there were some corrections to the wording, the Business Principles have been inherited with no change in the contents up to now.
Business Principles
Article 1
Sumitomo shall achieve prosperity based on solid foundation by placing prime importance on integrity and sound management in the conduct of its business.
Article 2
Sumitomo’s business interest must always be in harmony with public interest; Sumitomo shall adapt to good times and bad times but will not pursue immoral business.
萬事入精 Banji-nissei
Banji-nissei means “do your sincere best, not only in business, but also in every aspect of your life. ”Originating from the preamble of Monjuin Shiigaki, it speaks of the importance of sincerity in all human endeavors. Banji-nissei is a pivotal teaching in the Sumitomo Spirit. Accordingly, Sumitomo personnel are expected to work not only to make money, but also to cultivate their character and grow into better human beings.
信用確実 Shinyo-kakujitsu
The Business Principles Article 1 emphasizes the importance of integrity; that is, being worthy of the trust of others.
不趨浮利 Fusu-furi
In its first part, Article 2 speaks of the importance of working proactively, pursuing profit by quickly and appropriately responding to changes in society and not being content with the status quo. At the same time, Article 2 emphasizes the importance of harmonizing business gains with the public interest and scorns reckless or careless actions in pursuit of easy gain. While furi means easy, temporary or short-term gain, the term also implies unfair profit obtained through dishonest means.
In addition, the Sumitomo Spirit also includes the following principles.
Attaching Importance to Technology
Sumitomo’s original copper business centered on the nanban-buki (foreign-style) refining technique that at the time was the leading edge of smelting technology. Emphasis on using the newest technology and actively developing new technologies has been a driving force in the development of Sumitomo business from its very beginnings.
Respect for Human Resources
Discovering and nurturing superior human resources has always been the most important objective for managers, and the Sumitomo tradition that “people make the enterprise” remains in full force to this day.
Long-Range Planning
The spirit of Sumitomo’s business planning developed from the original copper refining operation’s view toward long-term and continuous business. A realistic, long-term view of the future complemented by a wider perspective of country and society has guided Sumitomo managers for generations.
Mutual Prosperity, Respect for the Public Good
Sumitomo’s Director General Teigo Iba once said, “Sumitomo’s business must benefit not only Sumitomo itself but also the nation and society in general.” Sumitomo has always conducted business in harmony with the public interest based on the fundamental spirit of “gratitude toward society.”
Sumitomo's history and spirit are introduced on the following website.

Notable research
At Bosch, research forms the basis of our products and services. That means it plays a key role in the success of the Bosch brand.
Check out some of the milestones in the history of Bosch Research
Research has a long tradition at Bosch. The first patent filed under the name of Robert Bosch was issued in 1897 for an oscillating sleeve for the company’s magneto ignition device. Early on, Robert and his colleagues made a commitment to deliver outstanding levels of quality. They made their mark by identifying the latest trends and manufacturing new products from core technologies.
Ever since our company was founded, we have sought to play our part in making the world a better place, one small step at a time. Our conduct and business activities are guided by a brand promise: even before we create a product, we will always put an emphasis on quality in our research and in the results of that research. We understand that conducting research involves a responsibility to both our partners and the wider world, and we endeavor to fulfil that responsibility at all times. That’s how we create inspiring products. And that’s how we create technology “Invented for life”.
We conduct research in an international network
Our goal is to forge alliances with the best research institutes around the world. In addition, every Bosch location is expected to act as a kind of radar for Bosch Research by scanning its respective region to detect megatrends.

Spotting trends, improving existing products, and coming up with new ideas – this seems the best way to sum up the successful strategy that is the common thread running through the history of research and development at Bosch. It applies to the company’s very first product, the magneto ignition device, which would never have been successfully installed in a motor vehicle without the ingenuity of the people working in the new company. The specialists working for Bosch’s chief engineer Gottlob Honold came up with many technological highlights that paved the way for the company’s success.
Research and development provide the technical basis for overcoming the major challenges of the future.
Volkmar Denner
1886 - 1900
Courtyard trials – Early days in the workshop
Everybody starts out small. Things were no different for Robert Bosch in November 1886. With just one master craftsman and an errand boy, the “Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering” was a modest little affair in a courtyard-entrance building in Stuttgart. What we now envisage as research and development was practically unimaginable back then. At that time, Bosch did not have its own product portfolio, so there was not even a starting point for research and development activities. As far as business was concerned, Robert Bosch would later describe this period as “a shambles”. Individual orders kept his head above water. In 1897 however, the company had already applied for its first patent – an oscillating sleeve for magneto ignition devices.
1901 – 1925
Honold’s spark of genius – First steps
After a series of ups and downs, the small company run by Robert Bosch gradually expanded its workforce to 37 by 1900. Bosch built his first factory the following year, creating space for 200 associates in a modern reinforced concrete building complete with ventilation systems and large windows. However, the new factory did not yet include a research and development department. Robert Bosch had 200 associates by 1904 and as many as 1,000 by 1908. This rapid growth was all thanks to the high-voltage magneto ignition system for motor vehicles, developed by Gottlob Honold, his first chief engineer. It was Honold as well who drew the Bosch logo still used today, the double-T armature, in 1918. In addition to absolute thoroughness and an early promise of uncompromising quality, Robert Bosch and his associates distinguished themselves above all by recognizing trends and creating new products from basic technologies.
1926 - 1932
More irons in the fire – New businesses
When Walter Dorn began work in the physics department of the senior laboratory team in 1924, he wondered “why Bosch wanted me at all. In my naivety, I thought physicists were there to invent things. But everything Bosch was making had already been invented. So why did they need another physicist?” But they did in fact need physicists, because Bosch was then facing a period of profound upheaval. The sales crisis in the automotive market in 1925-1926 led Bosch to diversify its products. In this context, a department was established in 1930 to clarify “through preliminary investigations” which new products were suitable for inclusion in the company’s production program.
1933 - 1945
Troubled times
At first, research and development activities barely changed at all under the Nazi dictatorship. Bosch was able to continue its development projects in its established lines of business. But it was not long before the Nazi regime’s military plans began to have an impact on a number of research and development activities at Bosch, including gasoline injection for aircraft engines and television technology.
1946 - 1964
Venturing into the unknown – From stop-gap products to electronics
The Allied victory in the spring of 1945 ended the reign of terror imposed by the Nazi regime in Germany. Every helping hand available was needed and at first, the primary goal was to simply produce very simple products. It was essentially the development of individual semiconductor elements as the first electronic components for the automotive sector at the end of the 1950s that paved the way for a promising new area of business.
1965 - 1982
On solid ground – Reorganization
The 1960s brought fundamental changes for Bosch. With the company growing rapidly, the old centralized structure was replaced by the division-based organization still in place today. These far-reaching changes were also evident in more concrete terms. By 1964, the site in Stuttgart had become far too small and Bosch decided to relocate corporate headquarters and corporate research activities to a building complex on the “Schillerhöhe”, a wooded ridge around ten kilometers from the city center. This complex was completed in 1969. The innovations of the 1960s and 1970s, such as Jetronic and the anti-lock braking system, fitted in very well with a leitmotif for the development work that Bosch issued under the pressure of the first global oil crisis in 1973, namely to make driving safe, clean, and economical.
1983 - 2005
Developed for every market – Groundbreaking innovations and globalization
During the last two decades of the millennium, researchers and developers were confronted with an increasingly rapid pace of development across the globe. Bosch responded to the challenges this posed with technologies to meet new customer needs, a global R&D organization, new focal areas such as micromechanics, and new future-proof approaches in established areas, such as common-rail diesel injection. In 1983, for example, the EVA system, short for “Electronic Traffic Pilot for Motorists”, which laid the foundations for today’s vehicle navigation, was presented to the public. In autumn 1993, the Central Research and Advance Engineering Division, now known as Corporate Research, was established. There, research was to begin as usual with brainstorming and, if possible, end with prototype production before it was transferred to the respective division to start volume production.
2006 - 2015
Into the connected world – Energy efficiency and connectivity
When it comes to demonstrating the importance research and development has assumed at Bosch over the last four decades, the statistics speak for themselves. Between 1970 and 2000, the R&D budget increased roughly 15-fold, and its share of sales rose from 5.4 to roughly 8 percent. And since 1970, the total number of associates across all areas of research and development has increased from 5,500 to 59,000. Today, it is more and more a matter of presenting the right ideas and products derived from correctly identified megatrends and not developing them without social or technological prospects for the future. The Research and Advance Engineering Center in Renningen near Stuttgart, which opened in 2015, also illustrates the innovative orientation of the company and provides creativity with room to grow, along with guidelines for the development of market-oriented products – so that an idea can really be developed into a success story! With the founding of the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence in 2017, Bosch was again preparing to meet the new challenges of the future.

Reynolds Annual Security Report
©CellPrint Biotechnology, LLC (CellPrint) has developed and patented a powerful technology (CellPrint™) that the company is commercializing in order to advance the discovery and development of novel drug therapies.
CellPrint™ provides ultra-sensitive detection and precise quantification of cell-specific molecular expression that sets it apart from other available approaches. Using this technology, CellPrint is discovering important insights about pathogenesis and potential targets for therapeutic intervention. The company believes that its technology and insights can be transformational to drug development and it aims to partner with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in the design and execution of customized studies that apply CellPrint™ to drug discovery, preclinical assessments, clinical trials, and companion diagnostics.
Alzheimer’s disease, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, cancer, cardiovascular disease, cellular transplantation, infectious diseases, psychiatric disorders, and stroke are all therapeutic areas where the company could make important contributions. However, CellPrint views the use of its technology in the multiple sclerosis and cancer therapeutic areas as having the highest potential to achieve the company’s three success criteria: improve patient care, achieve near-term market success, and create value for CellPrint investors.

×Renewable. Reliable. Responsible.
Ormat is a leading company in the renewable energy sector. We’re committed to innovation and to advancing the tools and technologies that enable the most efficient development of renewable energy, reducing energy waste and providing sustainable energy management solutions.
ORMAT HAS HARNESSED NATURE’S RENEWABLE ENERGY FOR OVER FIVE DECADES.
HERE ARE SOME OF THE KEY MILESTONES THAT SHAPED THE COMPANY WE ARE TODAY:
1965
1965
Ormat was established in 1965 by the Bronicki family, who shared a bold vision to export breakthrough technology in the renewable energy sector.
At that time, Ormat was primarily known as a pioneer of proprietary turbine designs, capable of generating electricity from low enthalpy energy resources. In its early years, Ormat focused exclusively on manufacturing power generation equipment.
1970s
1970s
In the 1970s, Ormat expanded its technology and expertise in the Remote Power Unit (RPU) sector, providing RPUs for clients requiring reliable power generation in remote operating conditions. One of Ormat’s first RPU clients was the Trans-Alaska Pipeline project.
1980s
1980s
In the 1980s and throughout the 1990s, Ormat focused its growing renewable energy expertise on the geothermal industry. We developed Wabuska, a 2 MW geothermal power plant in Nevada, USA; our very first geothermal facility. This was followed in rapid succession by a series of major geothermal power plant acquisitions and developments, largely concentrated in Nevada and California, USA, which vaulted Ormat into the position of that country’s second largest geothermal power producer. The Integrated Two-Level Unit (ITLU) was a vital development in maximizing the thermodynamic efficiencies of lower-temperature resources. The patented ITLU design revolutionized the industry and, to this day, separates Ormat from the rest.
1982
1982
In 1982, Ormat developed the Solar Pond Power Plant – an experimental project to pilot the development of solar energy production.
Throughout the 1980s, Ormat developed its state-of-the-art Recovered Energy Generation (REG) power plant solutions, which utilize waste heat to create power, fully exploiting the energy potential found in different industrial processes, or gas compressor stations – converting unused heat into clean, emission-free, fuel-free electricity.
1990s
1990s
The 1990s were focused on positioning ourselves as a developer of geothermal power plants through technological advancement and continued supply of equipment worldwide. The first development was the 50 MW Leyte Optimization project in the Philippines under a BOT for 10 years starting in 1998. The inception of the Olkaria III complex with the 8 MW early generation in Kenya was the first stage in what is now a 140 MW complex.
2000s
2000s
In the 2000s we continued to grow in geothermal through the acquisition of geothermal assets in the US, increasing the total plants sold and reaching a total of 1300 MW in plants sold in 2010.
In 2004, Ormat completed an initial public offering on the New York Stock Exchange (ORA). Headquartered in Reno, Nevada, this transition to a public company enabled continued growth, expansion of our capabilities and the opportunity to participate in a wider variety of global power projects.
Through every decade, Ormat has continued to make major strides forward in the geothermal energy and recovered energy industries.  In the past several years, we’ve continued pursuing innovation in energy management, storage and demand response solutions; fields where we again show our strength as a vertically integrated solution provider.
Since Ormat began, our strong values have guided and shaped the way we work, our relationships with employees, clients, communities and other stakeholders, and the level of professionalism and spirit of innovation that accompanies every renewable power product and service we offer.
As a developer, operator and manufacturer of geothermal energy and recovered energy equipment, Ormat understands customer needs and creates field-proven solutions. Albert Einstein said, “The only source of knowledge is experience.” Our vast experience and constant feedback through both in-house and industry operations and applications has given us a full tool belt that our competitors don’t have.
Renewable energy and a vision for a cleaner, sustainable future have taken us this far – and we believe that our vision, capabilities and expertise will enable Ormat to flourish for ge­­nerations.

Find out moreWhat are Pressure Ulcers?
Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a common medical problem that can lead to pain, disfigurement, infection and death.1 Also known as bedsores or pressure sores, PUs are an area of localised damage to the skin and underlying tissue – usually over and around an area of bony prominence (e.g., sacrum, coccyx, heels, hips) – as a result of pressure with shear and/or friction.2 Bedsores can develop quickly and are often difficult to treat.3 
An Urgent Yet Preventable Problem
Prevalence:
In Europe, the prevalence of PUs ranges between 18 -23% in nursing homes and hospitals and can be as high as 57% in critical care units. In the US, they affect an estimated 2.5 million patients in acute care facilities
Complications:
PUs also can cause complications such as serious infections (sepsis, cellulitis, MRSA) and cancer. In the US, 60,000 patients die each year due to pressure ulcers.
Prevention:
With early risk assessment, approximately 80% of PUs can be prevented. Primary methods of prevention include repositioning the body to redistribute pressure, balanced diet, hydration and keeping the skin free from exposure to moisture.
Clinical Challenges With Today's Standard of Care
The current standard of care in pressure ulcer prevention is based on risk assessment and visual assessment of skin in areas prone to PUs. This approach has several significant challenges:
Risk assessment tools are limited
Low sensitivity (57%)
Specificity (67%)
By the time damage is visually evident, significant tissue damage has already occurred, this is particularly important for:
Dark-skinned patients
Deep tissue injury patients
Visual skin assessment is subjective and unreliable as it depends on the clinician's experience and expertise.
These assessments cannot reliably determine which patients are at risk or which patients have existing damage.
Current practice misses opportunities for early risk assessment and early intervention that can prevent PUs. As a result, expensive treatments are often offered to patients who don't need them, and conversely, not offered to those who do need them.

1. What are cookies?
For modern websites to work according to visitor’s expectations, they need to collect certain basic information about visitors. To do this, a site will create small text files which are placed on visitor’s devices (computer or mobile) - these files are known as cookies when you access a website. Cookies are used in order to make websites function and work efficiently.

Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to a visitor’s device.
Cookies do various jobs which make the visitor’s experience of the internet much smoother and more interactive. For instance, cookies are used to remember the visitor’s preferences on sites they visit often, to remember language preference and to help navigate between pages more efficiently. Much, though not all, of the data collected is anonymous, though some of it is designed to detect browsing patterns and approximate geographical location to improve the visitor experience.

©What attracts a talented individual to a global company? Many would say it's the corporate culture and work environment that make all the difference.
There is more to QIAGEN, of course, than facts and figures, markets and customers, products and production. Team enthusiasm and a collaborative spirit are a strong part of our corporate culture and identity. In a congenial environment like ours, the exchange of ideas can take place anywhere – not just during a team meeting, for example – but at lunch, over a coffee, or even waiting for the elevator. Surrounded by inspired and like-minded colleagues, inspiration could strike anytime. 
Dr. Annette Koch, Chief Human Resources Officer, describes the unique culture at QIAGEN: “What is really great about QIAGEN – beyond our products and our impact on innovation in science and medicine – is the working environment. We work in very international, collaborative teams of highly passionate and skilled colleagues, inspired by our Company mission to make improvements in life possible. We strive for a culture that focuses on the outcome and that values diversity of thought and experience. There is lots of opportunity for personal growth. We have a high level of respect for each other and a commitment to performance and personal integrity. It is fun and rewarding to work at QIAGEN."
Collaborative, cross-culture & global organization
Time and again, when we speak with our employees at sites across the globe, we hear about the engaging and collaborative environment that helps making QIAGEN not only a successful company but a great place to work.
“I enjoy the freedom I'm given to make informed decisions and steer my products.” 
Divya vijay pratheek, global product manager 
With more than 35 sites in 25 countries, we have grown to be truly global, having rapidly expanded from our flagship site in Hilden, Germany to countries and cultures across the globe. None of this growth would have been possible without the tremendous collaborative spirit that we have fostered from the beginning.
Without a global vision from the start, becoming a worldwide market leader would have been out of reach. A desire to embrace the various styles of communicating and doing business around the world has led to company success and customer satisfaction across the globe.
"My colleagues make the working environment enriching and enjoyable."
Alvin Lee, Associate Director QuantiFERON Market Development - Asia-Pacific
Diversity and inclusion make our teams strong
Based on the philosophy that "diversity strengthens us as an organization," our leaders actively strive to promote and implement diversity at all levels. Not only does diversity make QIAGEN a better place to work, it is a key success factor on the path to achieving our mission and goals.
Our commitment to diversity and inclusion
We are committed to continue creating an environment where all individuals have the opportunity to grow and contribute to our progress, regardless of their age, educational background, gender, nationality, physical abilities, race and ethical background, religion, or sexual orientation.
Diverse individuals make better teams
Teams strengthen our organization through the richness of their ideas and opinions. Furthermore, teams outperform and succeed when they are composed of individuals with the widest possible range of personalities, backgrounds, and traits.
Our individuals and teams promote diversity

Took up further challenges in very low-light-level measurement and single photon detection.
Succeeded in conducting Young's interference experiment with single photons.
Using the PIAS (Photon-counting Image Acquisition System), we conducted Young's double-slit interference experiment in the single photon counting region. This demonstrated that an interference pattern appeared by detecting individual photons one by one and then integrating them to create an image. The experimental results indicated that one photon passed through the double slit at the same time (wave interference) and then created one bright spot on the detector (particle’s photoelectric effect). Integrating each bright spot resulted in an image of interference fringes which clearly demonstrated dual properties of light (light is both a wave and a particle). The PIAS imaging system used for this experiment was named one of the “10 Great New Products 1984” by Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun in Japan and also earned an R&D Award from R&D Magazine in the USA. This definitely proved that our low-light-level measurement technology was highly appreciated both domestically and abroad.

Timeline
Pursuing the path of light
First starting from the founding of Tokai Electronics Laboratory in 1948, Hamamatsu TV Co., Ltd. was then established in 1953 followed by a company name change to Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. in 1983. All through this period and up to the present day, we here at Hamamatsu Photonics have been continually pursuing technologies involving “light” in all its aspects. Take a look along with us at the history of our company constantly pursuing the path of light since our founding.
Timeline
1948-1950s
Founding of the firm: Starting to challenge the possibilities of light
1948
Heihachiro Horiuchi founded Tokai Electronics Laboratory.
Project was launched amidst the ruins after the war with the dream of developing photoelectric devices.
Heihachiro Horiuchi founded Tokai Electronics Laboratory.
Project was launched amidst the ruins after the war with the dream of developing photoelectric devices.
Being fascinated by the wonder of light since the elementary school days, our founding president Heihachiro Horiuchi studied Electrical Engineering at Hamamatsu Industrial High School (now the Faculty of Engineering of Shizuoka University) as a student of Kenjiro Takayanagi who was one of the world’s pioneers of television technology research, and was greatly inspired by “Takayanagi-ism” after receiving his guidance and instruction. During the World War 2, Heihachiro Horiuchi worked on developing and manufacturing night-vision tubes in Tokyo and then in Yamagata in the northern region of Japan where the factory was evacuated due to bombing. However, when the war ended he had to completely restart his career. He returned to Hamamatsu in the post-war chaos and made a decision to utilize the photoelectric technology he had learned before and during the war. In 1948, he bought a factory site at 456 Ebitsuka-cho, Hamamatsu City, and established Tokai Electronics Laboratory.

1951
Developed the PV26 phototubes that were used for automatic on/off street light switching.
1953
Established Hamamatsu TV Co., Ltd. with the dream of linking optical technology with industry.
Established Hamamatsu TV Co., Ltd. with the dream of linking optical technology with industry.
Horiuchi decided to pursue the “path of light” by providing society with a means or namely products that would make effective use of light and he worked on developing photoelectric devices. In early 1951, Horiuchi’s efforts began to show signs of success as a promising inquiry came in for phototubes later called the PV29 and PV26 that he first worked on. At that point in time, Horiuchi was planning to dissolve Tokai Electronics Laboratory into another organization, and so he convinced Teruo Hiruma and Norio Hanyu, who he knew through his elder brother Yuji Takahashi (then Professor at Hamamatsu Industrial High School), to participate in his plan to establish a new company. This gave rise to the founding of Hamamatsu TV Co., Ltd.

Started production of G5E phototubes for fax transmissions.
Developed an underwater camera as our first video camera product.
Started finding applications in scientific and industrial fields.
Started finding applications in scientific and industrial fields.
We became involved in television applications in the fields of science and industry when we were asked by Professor Nobuyuki Kawamoto of Mie University to make an underwater camera for observing fish reefs. That was our first attempt to make a television camera. Preliminary experiments were successful and reported in newspaper, but the actual experiment with the camera loaded on the experimental ship did not succeed unfortunately. Nevertheless, this first attempt to make a television camera was a significant step as our first field experiment.

1956
1958
Our first mass-production line started up.
Our first mass-production line started up.
Up until that point, Hamamatsu TV had always been involved in electron tube products such as phototubes. Our first foray into semiconductor products was the CdS cell. After a hard struggle and repeated trials and errors, an employee succeeded in developing the product .  One day at the end of 1958, an order came in for 1,000 CdS cells per month for use in adjusting the brightness of television cathode ray tubes. As a company that had up until that time been producing multiple products in small lots, it was our first experience with mass production, and we had to mobilize all of our employees on the production side to get the order filled. The development of the CdS cell ended up bringing about many positive outcomes, among them an accumulation of semiconductor technology and a new sense of unity in-house, after all of the employees had worked together day and night on the production effort.

1959
Succeeded in developing photomultiplier tubes that are still our main products.
Succeeded in developing photomultiplier tubes that are still our main products.
Among various types of photodetectors, photomultiplier tubes offer superior features such as extremely high sensitivity and fast time response. Around 1955, chemical analysis instruments using photomultiplier tubes began to be manufactured and demand for them also increased in Japan. However, most of such equipment was imported from overseas at that time.Around that time, one of our customers said to us, "If Hamamatsu TV could produce photomultiplier tubes, we would call you the 'king' of the industry." That made our engineers realize the necessity for development of these tubes, and provided the motivation for them to undertake the project. The photomultiplier tube that they developed through many trials and tribulations was far superior to those of other companies, and that product was what gave us a solid footing as an opto-technology company.

1960s
Business expansion and development: Taking up new challenges in unknown fields
1963
1964
Experimental production of hollow cathode lamps and deuterium lamps began.
Opened our New York office.
1967
Succeeded in developing an automatic rocket tracking system called the X-Y Tracker.
Started to take part in space development projects.
Succeeded in developing rocket automatic tracking device
Participation in the space development project began.
We spent two years developing automatic rocket tracking system (the X-Y tracker), something that was requested by Professor Tsuneyoshi Uemura of Tokyo University, and after many hardships we succeeded in creating a prototype. This X-Y tracker was able to flawlessly track the rocket immediately after launch, and observers visiting from America praised it highly, saying that it was the most advanced device of anything that they had seen at the Uchinoura test facility. At that time, even NASA was using photographic strip film for orbital tracking of rockets, and the X-Y tracker was truly an epochal device. It provided the opportunity for us to take part in space development projects such as cameras for observing the aurora borealis and cameras for the "Suisei", the probe tracking Halley's comet.

1969
Expanded into medical fields.
Developed an eye pupil area measurement system using a video camera.
Developed an eye pupil area measurement system using a video camera.
Tetsu Ishikawa, a lecturer at the Tokyo University Faculty of Medicine, thought that if a device were developed that made it possible to accurately measure pupillary responses (changes in the surface area of the iris) closely related to autonomous nervous system functions, it would be the first such device in the world to be able to do so, and he came to us to see if we could develop it. The development of this "Iriscoder" not only required that we focus everything on improving the product precision, as we had in the past, but also required that we take on a field that was completely unknown to us. That was the field of medical equipment manufacturing, which included camera performance, the convenience of use for physicians, taking the psychological state of the subject into consideration, and other elements with which we were unfamiliar. This device was used to study pupillary responses (adaptation of the eye to darkness and brightness) when entering and driving through tunnels, and the results of those experiments are still at work today in expressway tunnel illumination.

Established an affiliated company in the USA
1970s
Preparation for the big leap: Laying the cornerstone for solid-state products and system products.
1972
Developed silicon photodiodes based on the technical expertise we had accumulated through the development and manufacture of electron tubes.
Developed silicon photodiodes based on the technical expertise we had accumulated through the development and manufacture of electron tubes.
Around that time, the camera maker to whom we were supplying CdS cells asked us to develop a silicon photodiode for use with cameras, saying that, as semiconductor components, these photodiodes offered better measurement accuracy and response characteristics than CdS cells. Silicon photodiodes were viewed as very promising at the time as sensors for camera exposure meters and measuring instruments. We got off to a late start in that field, but we drew on the knowhow and the sales channels that we had built up through our electron tube development and manufacturing, and silicon photodiodes later grew to be one of the main products of our Solid State Division.

Established a joint venture company in West Germany (now Germany).
1977
Opening up new borders through connections with computers.
Developed vidicon camera for computers.
Developed vidicon camera for computers.
In 1971, microcomputers appeared on the market and their use spread rapidly. We were quick to open up new frontiers in computer-compatible video cameras. The model C1000 (vidicon camera for computers) was an innovative high-precision video camera with the basic performance and functions needed for image processing and measurement. This was quite different from other conventional video cameras that were designed just for “viewing” tasks such as for monitoring and surveillance. The C1000 enabled sophisticated image processing using a computer and its applications were extended to various fields. This combination of video camera and computer is still a feature of our current system products.

1978
A space-borne TV camera we developed helped succeed in capturing aurora images from outer space for the first time in the world.
A space-borne TV camera we developed helped succeed in capturing aurora images from outer space for the first time in the world.
“I’d like to observe auroras from outer space by mounting a TV camera on an artificial satellite.” We received a request to develop a satellite-borne TV camera from Prof. Takao Tohmatsu, an authority on geophysics of the Geophysics Research Laboratory, University of Tokyo. In a limited time, we worked to develop a vacuum UV image storage tube and a TV camera that would be able to operate reliably for a period of one year under harsh conditions in space such as a vacuum, extremely cold or hot temperatures, and exposure to radiation, as well as having the high durability needed against vibration and shocks applied during the satellite launch. In 1978, the Japanese scientific satellite EXOS-A (later named “Kyokko”) equipped with our special TV camera was launched. After 20 days, when the satellite had traveled around the earth 214 times, it succeeded in capturing 8 beautiful images of an aurora among the 20 images that were taken at that time. This was the first success in the world in capturing aurora images from outer space, and made our company name well-known worldwide in the field of space development.

1980s
The age of photonics: Changing from Hamamatsu TV Co., Ltd. to Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.
1980
Our first private exhibition called the Photon Fair was held to introduce and demonstrate our wide-ranging photonics technology and products.
Our first private exhibition called the Photon Fair was held to introduce and demonstrate our wide-ranging photonics technology and products.
Having had a good response from customers visiting our "Hamamatsu General Exhibition Osaka" held in 1979 to commemorate the opening of our Osaka sales office, we also held our first overall exhibition called the Photon Fair the next year 1980 in Osaka and Tokyo. The exhibition name Photon Fair was derived from the elementary particle called a photon used in our business slogan “Photon is our business” so as to let more people become familiar with the exhibition. Besides just exhibiting a full range of our products, we also introduced new technologies and made efforts to provide technical consultations, lectures and workshops, so that we could propagate our business philosophy and attitude by way of the Photon Fair. Even now, the Photon Fair is held regularly as an effective place for meeting and talking with customers to exchange ideas and information.

1982
Decided to reorganize the company into business divisions for greater flexibility in meeting business needs of the changing times.
Decided to reorganize the company into business divisions for greater flexibility in meeting business needs of the changing times.
Up to that time, our production department had been managed and controlled as one basic unit. However, since the company’s scale had expanded and the number of product types had increased, we reorganized the company into business divisions to quickly and accurately respond to the changing times and offer more flexible business operations. The company was divided into 3 business divisions: Electron Tube Division, Solid State Division, and Systems Division. The main office and factories of each division had been gathered in an area different from each other, so they have been located there up to today.

Succeeded for the first time in the world in artificial indoor cultivation of rice plants using semiconductor lasers.
This plant factory succeeded in artificially cultivating rice plants in an indoor farm, for the first time in the world using high-power semiconductor lasers instead of sunlight. This experiment relied on semiconductor lasers that were fabricated by applying our technology developed for laser fusion research. Those semiconductor lasers were designed to emit light at 680 nm where the chloroplasts in rice leaves photosynthesize most vigorously. Compared to conventional cultivation methods used in plant factories, this new method applying semiconductor lasers drastically cuts the power cost and shortens the cultivation period, offering the possibility of eliminating global food shortage in the future.

Opened the Graduate School for the Creation of New Photonics Industries with the goal of creating new photonics industries.
As we move into the 21st century, remarkable globalization is taking place throughout the world in both industrial and economic sectors. In Japan, which has built the foundation for an economic empire by taking academic learning and technologies introduced from foreign countries and further developing and expanding applications for those technologies, we're now finding that we ourselves need to create new industries, and in turn new cultures, which we can then send out into the rest of the world. The Graduate School for the Creation of New Photonics Industries was established by Hamamatsu Photonics and other enterprises for the purpose of cultivating human resources capable of launching new industries that will focus on light and its infinite possibilities. Put differently, the founding of new industries itself is the foremost objective of education at the University.

Principles and organization of our Central Research Laboratory
Life Photonics
A future where the Earth, its people, and all living things coexist in a harmonious balance - Hamamatsu Photonics aims to make this dream a reality through research into “light” which is the source of all matter.
What will our future be like 20 or 30 years from now? How about a future where all people can enjoy comfortable and active lives with peace of mind and where an optimal balance is maintained among the Earth, its people and all living things? To make this dream a reality we will have to overcome many obstacles and challenges.

Our Central Research Laboratory is conducting R&D work that conforms to “sustainability” values. We call this work “Life Photonics” which is based on the theme of “life” encompassing a broad range of areas such as life, living things, human life, vitality sources, and ways of living. We will continue researching a diverse spectrum of photonics and optical technologies taking “Life Photonics” as our motivating theme.
What is light? What can we do with light? Technology development at Hamamatsu always starts as a dialogue with light. In this process, our Central Research Laboratory and a number of specialized research facilities play fundamental roles and conduct basic research into light, while pursuing applied research across a diverse range of fields including Optical information processing and measurement, Health and medical care, biotechnology, material science, and energy.
Facilities
The Central Research Laboratory in Hamamatsu City, Shizuoka Pref. is home to a host of specialized research facilities including the Research Center, the Material Center, the PET Center, the Medical Imaging Center, and the Biotechnology Center. In the Central Research Laboratory, a wide range of research is carried out ranging from basic research which pursues the nature of light to applied research in which the knowledge and technology acquired through basic research is applied in industries.
At our Industrial Development Research Center located in Hamamatsu City, we are setting our sights on creating new industries that utilize light for fields including power generation, medical care, and material modification, while working on our core research of “laser fusion” that has the potential to extract energy from hydrogen isotopes in seawater always available in endless quantities.
Tsukuba Research Laboratory in Tsukuba City, Ibaraki Pref. primarily conducts research on bio-photonics in which opto-technology is applied in the field of life science.

Research Fields
Optical information processing and measurement 
To achieve the grand dream of “optical computers” as well as an understanding the “complex systems” and “interactions between light and matter,” we have conducted extensive research and created technology for generating and applying so-called new light. We are progressing step by step toward an entirely new type of information processing achieved through research into highly sophisticated light control and measurement on the spatial axis, time axis, and wavelength axis of light.
Health and medical care 
What can photonics technology do to bring ”true health” to all of us? A wide variety of approaches have been continually applied in this field to provide people with a full and healthy life. These include development of PET systems and PET applied research, biomedical measurement using near-infrared light, sports-related measurements and even biotechnology-related research. These research approaches also serve to expand the future potential of photonics technology itself.
Biophotonics 
Biotechnology research is the best possible field for following up on the possibilities offered by photonics technology. We have been doing applied research in this field in a continual search for what can only be revealed by light and in areas where light is of critical importance. This field offers unlimited possibilities for applying photonics technology and we are doing our utmost to propose new photonics technology combining diverse technical areas including light sources and sensors as well as bioassay technology.
Optical materials
In the interaction between light and matter, when the structure of a substance is the same or smaller than the nano-region or in other words the target light wavelength, then that material behaves completely different than it would in the macro region. We refer to this interaction between light and matter and also the interaction between light and electrons in the nano-region as nanophotonics. Our current research in this field focuses on new materials and optical devices that utilize the interaction between this new type of light and matter.
Energy
The start of a new industry gives people a new way of life which then creates a new sense of values. The new and true knowledge found from this new sense of values gives birth to new science. To develop new industrial fields, we are setting our sights on creating new industries that utilize light, such as power generation, medical care, and material modification while working on our core research of “laser fusion” that has the potential to extract energy from hydrogen isotopes in seawater available in limitless quantities.

The spirit of pursuing the unknown and unexplored - inherited from our predecessors
Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. started as a small firm established in 1953 by Heihachiro Horiuchi who studied under the guidance of Dr. Kenjiro Takayanagi now respectfully called the “father of Japanese television.” Since then, we have inherited the “photoelectric technology” developed by Dr. Takayanagi for converting light into electrical signals as well as “the spirit of pursuing unknown and unexplored realms” which led him to the achievement of displaying the Japanese character “イ” on a cathode-ray tube for the first time in the world. Over the past 65 years, we have been consistently engaged in developing photoelectric devices and their application products while moving forward along with the continuing advances in technologies of light.
Just as electrons and electronics brought immeasurable richness to our lives in the 20th century, the 21th century will be the age of photons (particles of light) and photonics. Spurred by the unlimited possibilities of light, photonics technology is increasingly applied in a wide range of fields. However, the interaction of light with matter is still hardly understood at the present time. By pursuing the ultimate limits of photoelectric conversion technology to approach the true nature of light, Hamamatsu Photonics has been challenging the unknown where no one has yet explored, with the aim of creating new industries by utilizing light and acquiring new knowledges.
“Fortune” - the goddess of fortune in Roman myth
To catch the goddess of fortune, one has to get ahead of her and seize her by the forelocks.
Dr. Kenjiro Takayanagi (1899 to 1990)
Dr. Kenjiro Takayanagi - “Father of Japanese television”
Dr. Kenjiro Takayanagi - “Father of Japanese television” Dr. Kenjiro Takayanagi was born in Hamamatsu, Japan in 1899, and graduated from the industrial teacher training school attached to the Tokyo Kuramae Higher Technical School (now Tokyo Institute of Technology). In 1924, he returned to his hometown Hamamatsu and took a post as an assistant professor at Hamamatsu Industrial High School (now the Faculty of Engineering of Shizuoka University), and at the same time he started research on television technology. Being encouraged by the school philosophy “Freedom and Enlightenment,” Dr. Takayanagi’s research team succeeded for the first time in the world in displaying an image (Japanese character “イ”) on an electronic television screen. This was in 1926, a mere 2 years after he had started his research work.
Heihachiro Horiuchi, the founding president of our company, studied as a student directly under Dr. Takayanagi and was guided by him at Hamamatsu Industrial High School. Dr. Takayanagi spoke to his students from time to time saying things like, “What is the purpose of that technology? Will technology prove beneficial to our lives? Make these questions a fundamental part of your research at all times.” He also admonished us not to “learn for learning’s sake” and “research for research’s sake” and always struggled to link the acts of learning and research to value in human life and human society. He never changed this philosophy throughout his whole life.

Seizing the forelocks of the goddess
As Kenjiro Takayanagi was pursuing his research and was engaged in developing technology that would serve society ten to twenty years in the future, he occasionally had a mental image of the goddess of fortune, and always saw her portrayed as a beautiful woman with full bangs, but no hair at the back of her head. Playing with this idea, Takayanagi imagined that, in order to seize the goddess of fortune, one would have to be one step ahead of her, wait for her to catch up, and then turn around and seize her by the forelocks. Applying this whimsical fancy to his work, Takayanagi resolved to always be one step ahead and have the technology ready when the opportunity to apply it came within reach. Hamamatsu Photonics carries on this spirit today, constantly striving to be ready and waiting when opportunity arises.

We are also living in the unknown and this supreme unknown is light

Being fascinated by the wonders of light since his elementary school days, Heihachiro Horiuchi entered the Electrical Department of Hamamatsu Industrial High School (now the Faculty of Engineering of Shizuoka University) where his hero Professor Takayanagi was teaching and was greatly inspired by the professor’s philosophy called Takayanagi-ism. Horiuchi decided to follow this “path of light” by providing society with the means or namely products that would make effective use of light and he worked on developing photoelectric devices that convert light into electrical signals and even now this basic technology still supports our work.
“Pursuing the path of light” (the words spoken by Horiuchi at the 40th anniversary of the founding of our company)
At the time that the words “optical industry” did not even exist, I thought of making a living by starting a company to produce and sell photoelectric devices. Some of my seniors were worried and advised me, “Those things are like works of art and won’t make any business profits from the viewpoint of both marketability and yield rate. So should give up on this dream.” However, I had heard a story during my elementary school days: “The light from Polaris also called the North Star travels through space for 800 light-years before reaching us on Earth.” Since then, I have been totally fascinated by “light” and also attracted to the Professor Takayanagi’s research on television and my thoughts resonated with the spirit of Takayanagi-ism. All of this had already led me to the decision that I would go my own way to pursue the path of light even if I didn’t have enough food, clothing or shelter, so there was nothing to hold me back from following my dream. Light is the source of our lives and also greatly relates to our mental activities. Nevertheless, light is nearly totally unknown to us. I then established the management philosophy underlying a way to understand the nature of light and provide society with a means that allows us to make more use of light.
Instead of being taught by someone, try to see it with your own eyes, listen to it with your own ears, and understand it with your own heart.
What we do not yet know and what we have not yet done are infinite.

Teruo Hiruma, Former Chairman and CEO
Teruo Hiruma is one of the founding members and the former president of our company. After graduating in 1947 from the Machinery Department of Hamamatsu Industrial High School in the old education system (now the Faculty of Engineering of Shizuoka University), he established “Hamamatsu TV Co., Ltd.” along with Heihachiro Horiuchi and Norio Hanyu in 1953. Then, in 1978, Teruo Hiruma became the second president. He strongly pushed toward the challenge of opening up the unknown and unexplored which was taken over from Dr. Takayanagi and Heihachiro Horiuchi, and as a result our company has grown into a worldwide company leading the pack in photonics technology. In 1983, the company name was changed to “Hamamatsu Photonics K.K.” Then, in 2004, Teruo Hiruma became Chairman and Representative Director of Hamamatsu Photonics. Since 2017, he has served as honorary chairman of Hamamatsu Photonics.
Photon is our business. First an idea, next a goal, and finally a way.
Today, the application of light is ubiquitous in every field around us. Each field has become a large market and created its own specific industries. We have gained a great deal of knowledge through photonics technology in measuring the ultimate limits of light and its applied research especially in cutting-edge research fields. Based on this knowledge amassed over many years, we are aiming ourselves to create new industries by using photonics technology.
As long as we work in the field of light and photonics, we have an important role to play in pursuing and revealing the possibilities of light in this century. There are lots of things to do. Don’t say, I CAN’T, instead say, I WILL TRY.
