About Iron
Iron is a fundamental material that supports industry and everyday life.
Iron is a wonderfully hard and strong material that can be processed flexibly for use in diverse applications, which is why it has been present in human civilization for millennia.
In the industrial revolution, iron played a vital role in key fields such as railroads, ships, construction and manufacturing. Steam engines and other power devices made with iron drove the development of modern civilization. In the 20th century, the widespread popularization of automobiles and consumer appliances would not have been possible without iron. Moreover, iron is highly recyclable and can be reused in any form over and over.
Currently accounting for approximately 90% of all metal products, iron underpins virtually every industry and--either directly or indirectly--is part of almost all aspects of our everyday lives.
