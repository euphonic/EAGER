THE FUTURE OF OPV
OPV IN WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY
Organic photovoltaics will always be useful in applications involving energy. They are aesthetically appealing and can easily be integrated in applications as a deployable energy generator for rural and urban sectors, military purposes, and natural disaster areas. When it comes to the Wearable Technology industry, one of the biggest challenges that the industry faces is the limited battery life that plagues most of its products. Here, at Solarmer, we are trying to address that issue. OPV will be the most sought after technology for wearables as they are light-weight, thin, beautiful, flexible, and non-toxic. OPV-powered IoT sensors will allow its users to focus on something more important rather than worrying about running out of battery.
