History
Pioneers create history
Hoya Corporation was founded in the city of Hoya, Tokyo, 1941, by Shoichi and Shigeru Yamanaka, two visionary brothers. Originally a small manufacturer of optical lenses, the company saw opportunities in the emerging fields of healthcare and information technology.
Today, Hoya technology can also be found in medical camera lenses, Blu-ray players, smartphones, computers and televisions. For more than 75 years we have been driven by our dedication to innovate and use cutting-edge technology for providing the very finest eyeglass lenses to the market.
