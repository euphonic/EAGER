About WiSys
WiSys was established in 2000 and is an independent, nonprofit supporting organization for the UW System. As the official designated technology transfer office for the UW System Comprehensive Campuses, WiSys advances scientific research throughout the state by patenting technologies developed out of the universities and licensing these inventions to companies capable of developing them to benefit Wisconsin and beyond. The strong partnership between WiSys and the UW System helps the UW campuses fulfill their roles as twenty-first century leaders in research, discovery and innovation.
WiSys works hand-in-hand with inventors, researchers and students to facilitate cutting-edge research programs, identify, protect, develop and commercialize discoveries emanating from the research base as well as foster a spirit of innovative and entrepreneurial thinking on the campuses it serves. The ongoing, innovative research taking place throughout our UW Comprehensive Campuses is a tribute to the scientific expertise and creativity of our faculty, staff and students. WiSys is playing a pivotal role in ensuring such innovative research is translated into marketable products and services for the benefit of the UW System and society as a whole.
Our Vision
Our Mission
Supporting the creation and transfer of innovations from the University of Wisconsin System to the marketplace
The Wisconsin Idea
First attributed to UW President Charles Van Hise in 1904, the Wisconsin Idea is the principle that education should influence and improve people's lives beyond the university classroom. For more than 100 years, this idea has guided the university's work. Read more about the Wisconsin Idea and its history .
UW Institutions We Work With
The University of Wisconsin System is one of the largest systems of public higher education in the country, educating approximately 180,000 students each year, employing more than 39,000 faculty and staff and serving more than one million citizens through statewide extension programs.
Supported by an annual budget of $6B, the UW System comprises two doctoral campuses (Madison and Milwaukee), eleven Comprehensive Campuses (Eau Claire, Green Bay, La Crosse, Oshkosh, Parkside, Platteville, River Falls, Stevens Point, Stout, Superior and Whitewater), thirteen branch campuses, and a statewide Extension with offices located across each of the 72 counties. Together, these institutions contribute greatly to the state’s growing ‘knowledge economy’ and are a tremendous academic and cultural resource for Wisconsin, the nation, and the world, contributing $15+ billion annually to the economy.

PRIVACY POLICYInterested in a Startup?
As part of its ongoing mission to move inventions created by UW System researchers to the marketplace, WiSys offers assistance to faculty, staff and students who wish to start companies with technology licensed from WiSys. We are eager to help startup companies succeed and advance UW System technologies from the lab to marketplace for public use and benefit.
If you are interested in forming a startup company, WiSys may be able to provide resources or introductions to groups around Wisconsin that can help move your venture forward. You will likely need technical expertise, legal resources, investment, marketing and market research in the very early stages of your formation and WiSys can help.
Below, entrepreneurs can find steps that may be helpful in understanding the overall process of licensing a technology from WiSys into a new startup company.
Steps to Obtaining a License
Preferably before meeting with WiSys:
Determine feasibility of proposed company by completing a Feasibility Checklist ; and
Identify founding members that will actively participate in the new startup.
Contact a WiSys staff member to:
Request a standstill period, if desired;
By entering into a Standstill Agreement with WiSys, your company will gain additional time to evaluate the commercial potential of the technology as well as develop a full business plan. During this time (generally 6 months), WiSys agrees not to license the technology in question to another party.
Complete and submit full business plan and startup application; and
Engage in discussion and negotiation.
WiSys will work with you on follow-up actions:
Approve and execute final agreements; and
Monitor agreements with your company on an ongoing basis to provide additional support and ensure obligations and milestones are met.
Start-Up Obligations
After you have licensed the technology, as with any startup, your company must meet certain milestones and obligations.
Financial obligations may include an upfront fee, patent reimbursement, milestone fees, ongoing royalties or grant of equity. Review our standard licensing terms here .
WiSys also requires the company to submit royalty reports on a quarterly basis once product sales begin. The royalty rate normally is calculated as a percentage of the selling price of product.
WiSys Startups
WiSys currently has ten startup companies in its portfolio operating in markets ranging from sustainable technology, biotech and medtech, software development as well as materials science.
Today, our companies are producing non-invasive devices for cancer detection and accessible rehabilitation, next generation materials for the automotive, solar and electronic industries as well as microbial systems for production of specialty chemicals and biofuels.
