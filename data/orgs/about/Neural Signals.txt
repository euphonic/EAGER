Our Short History
The Neurotrophic Electrode is the essential technology on which the whole effort is based. It was first developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia, and implanted in rats in 1986. Dr. Roy A. E. Bakay was instrumental in performing monkey implants of the electrode at Yerkes Primate Center, Emory University, Atlanta Georgia from 1989 to 1992. Following those successful studies, the first human implant was performed in 1986 with FDA permission at Emory University. Five subjects have been implanted to date, the last being in 2004. The first four were aimed at providing communication to a computer in order to produce synthesized speech slowly spelled out letter by letter. The 2004 subject was implanted with the aim of providing near-conversational speech of several short but useful phrases. Details of this successful implant are in the publications in the Research section.
