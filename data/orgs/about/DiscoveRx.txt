Eurofins DiscoverX is an innovative company that develops, manufactures, and commercializes reagents, complete cell-based assay kits, profiling and screening services as well as other turnkey solutions for the drug discovery, screening, and life science markets. Our biochemical and cell-based assays enable customers to improve research productivity and effectiveness of their screening, lead optimization and SAR campaigns, thus accelerating the discovery and development of new drugs. Plus, with the addition of the BioMAP® platform of human primary cell systems for phenotypic profiling, Eurofins DiscoverX offers a powerful tool to deliver physiologically relevant insights and integrated solutions for all stages of discovery from target and lead discovery to preclinical and beyond.
Business Overview
Acquired by Eurofins Pharma Discovery Services in 2017, Eurofins DiscoverX is dedicated to the development and commercialization of innovative solutions for discovery research.
Proven Technology
The Company pioneered the use of β-galactosidase enzyme fragment complementation (EFC) for discovery research. EFC technology is a proven, established screening platform in most major pharmaceutical companies and our EFC-based HitHunter
®
 cAMP assays are the market leader in GPCR screening applications. PathHunter
®
 and InCELL Hunter™ technology platforms, an adaptation of EFC technology, are an innovative and comprehensive assay system that enables live cell-based assays for pathway profiling and compound screening.
In addition to the EFC platform, Eurofins DiscoverX also holds extensive intellectual property for its second core technology, an
 in vitro
 binding assay platform called KINOME
scan
SM
. Through our core technologies, Eurofins DiscoverX is able to offer assay solutions for every major class of drug target, including GPCRs, kinases, bromodomains, methyltranseferases, proteases, nuclear hormone receptors, cytokines, transcription factors and secreted proteins.
Corporate Partnerships
Eurofins DiscoverX remains committed to fully exploit the commercial potential of its EFC as well as KINOME
scan
 technology either solely or with its corporate partners.  Eurofins DiscoverX values such partnerships and is actively seeking additional collaborative alliances to commercialize and provide early access to new technology platforms in the drug discovery and development markets.
