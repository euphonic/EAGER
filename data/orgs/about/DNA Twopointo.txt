ATUM is the leading bioengineering solutions provider. Founded in 2003, ATUM (formerly DNA2.0®) offers an integrated pipeline of solutions for the research community, including platforms for protein and vector engineering, products such as expression vectors, fluorescent and chromogenic proteins, cell strains and reagents, as well as gene design, optimization, synthesis and cloning. ATUM is based in the US, with a global customer base encompassing academia, government and the pharmaceutical, chemical, agricultural and biotechnology industries. ATUM is by far the most published synthetic biology vendor, providing expert support to and collaboration with scientists. The company is privately held and is headquartered in Newark, California
With a reverence for the interplay between science, technology and nature, ATUM has developed a unique engineering platform based on machine learning and Design of Experiment (DoE).  The ProteinGPS®  proprietary protein engineering technology uses megadimensional, empirical optimization processes to calculate the set of nodes that are information-rich in the relevant space, gene synthesis to make those exact sequences, and machine learning to find the preferred solution. The result: precise engineering of any measurable property in any protein so that it fulfills the exact functional criteria needed for commercialization. The proprietary VectorGPS® technology uses Design-of-Experiment (DoE) algorithms to build testable numbers of vectors from sets of control elements, and advanced machine learning to assess the contribution of each element to vector performance; resulting in custom vectors engineered precisely for individual proteins and expression systems.
While leading the industry in creating value-added applications through protein engineering, vector design and gene synthesis, ATUM has also chosen to emphasize customer service as a critical measure of success. The freely available ATUM software tool  Gene Designer  and the online DNA ATLAS , put all the tools and expertise needed for DNA sequence management and design at the fingertips of the user.

ATUM elves at the Univ Northpole utilize the Leap-In transposase technology for CHO-HO-HO cell line development.
Prof Laura Menorah's team at the Univ Northpole has used whole genome sequencing and genome-wide functional association studies to identify the red fluorescent protein, Rudolph. Directed evolution and protein engineering (ProteinGPS) further identified eight additional colors. The reindeer proteins are in the public domain and sold under the BioBrick Public Agreement.
A research team lead by Prof Laura Menorah at the Univ Northpole has systematically identified Christmas carols deposited in sequence data, and established their direct role in the functional imprint and transfer of genetic information. They name this exciting new field of research Carolomics.
The Hoho2 gene responsible for facial hair formation of Santa Claus is  isolated and shown to be an ortholog of human KRT6B. The Hoho2 gene was codon optimized and and the corresponding protein expressed in E. coli, reindeer and human. RNAi knockout constructs could be  trans-complemented with an RNAi resistant Hoho2 variant. Brilliant science by Prof Elf and coworkers at Univ Northpole.
