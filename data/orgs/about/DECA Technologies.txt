The Deca difference is in our dynamic manufacturing capability, which gives our customers the competitive edge in cycle time and new product introductions thanks to rapid time-to-market capabilities.
Built on 10X thinking: The philosophy that achieving exponential improvements can only happen by shifting from conventional approaches to manufacturing Deca’s solar-inspired production line enables game-changing NPI cycle time, while our software-driven lithography technology enables unparalleled speed and flexibility in manufacturing.
Our award-winning M-Series fan-out wafer-level technology with adaptive patterning has been adopted for high-volume mobile chip-set applications and licensed to a leading manufacturer for dual-source production.
The combination of a highly experienced management team and inventive thinking results in a strong IP portfolio with innovative solutions for our customers.Staying competitive in today’s rapidly growing wafer-level chip scale package (WLCSP) market is all about time:
Time to market
Time to response
Time for new technologies
While your competitors are still waiting for new mask sets to start a product build, Deca’s 10X approach is already rolling your new WLSCP product of its Autoline.
Consumer electronics manufacturers demand low-cost WLCSP devices with rapid turnaround from design to delivery, which poses a challenge when using conventional approaches. Time-to-ramp for new product introductions is critical, as is dynamic manufacturing capability from the WLCSP supply base.
