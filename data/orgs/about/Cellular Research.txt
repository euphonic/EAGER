Our mission is to drive scientific leadership towards public transparency through: research, study analysis, and review in order to provide accurate information about research, medicine, and the environment for the public.
Cellular Research Institute or CRI is composed of a collaborator team of researchers from Universities, Labs and Research Centers within the US. The Research and Analysis team is selected each time from a group of our collaborators based on their expertise and relevance for each specific research or review topic.
We believe the Scientific community has a responsibility to the public for providing transparent information about the effects of new treatments, drugs, supplements and medications. Including further transparency of environment-released chemicals such as pesticides, introduced GMO's and other un-natural additions and their relation to over all, long-term human health.
CRI was developed specifically for this purpose to research, analyze and review available research, studies and information provided to the public in order to provide a transparent third party analysis and make our research findings available for the public.
