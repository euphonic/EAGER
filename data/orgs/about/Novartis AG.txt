Novartis Corporate History
Novartis was created in 1996 through a merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz. Novartis and its predecessor companies trace roots back more than 250 years, with a rich history of developing innovative products.
In 1758, Johann Rudolf Geigy-Gemuseus (1733-1793) founds the trading company J.R. Geigy in Basel, Switzerland to deal in "Materials, Chemicals, Dyes and Drugs of all Kinds."
In 1859, Alexander Clavel (1805-1873) takes up the production of fuchsine, a synthetic dye, in his silk dyeing factory in Basel, Switzerland.
The chemical company Kern & Sandoz is founded in Basel, Switzerland in 1886 by Dr. Alfred Kern (1850-1893) and Edouard Sandoz (1853-1928). The first dyes produced are alizarin blue and auramine.
In 1900, Ciba produces its first pharmaceutical substances: Vioform, an antiseptic, and Salen, an antirheumatic agent. This image shows pharmaceutical research at Ciba in Basel, Switzerland in 1914.
In 1917, Professor Arthur Stoll creates a pharmaceutical department at Sandoz, and research begins.
Geigy President Louis von Planta and CIBA President Robert Käppeli shake hands to conclude the merger of CIBA-GEIGY in 1970.
In 1996, the merger of Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy creates Novartis, one of the world's largest healthcare companies. This image, taken on February 3, 1997, shows the old logo being changed out at the Novartis St. Johann site in Basel.
Novartis unifies and strengthens its global research network in 2002 by creating the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR), headquartered in the US in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
In 2010, Novartis becomes the world leader in eye care when it acquires majority ownership in Alcon, Inc., based in the US in Fort Worth, Texas.
In 2015, Novartis completes a series of transactions that focus the company on three divisions: Innovative Medicines, Alcon (eye care) and Sandoz (generic medicines).

Our strategy is to use science-based innovation to deliver better patient outcomes in growing areas of healthcare.
Science-based innovation
We believe innovation that produces breakthrough medicines and products will be more important than ever in the healthcare industry in the coming years. We maintain substantial investment in research and de­­velopment (R&D) aimed at areas of unmet medical need. Our product pipeline is fed by a research and development approach that uses the latest science to advance the most promising projects.
Our research strategy aims to increase collaboration across traditional scientific and organizational boundaries, and focus on powerful new technologies that have the potential to help produce therapeutic breakthroughs. In drug development, we pursue promising therapies where we can leverage the scale and expertise of Novartis to bring important treatments to patients globally.
Better patient outcomes
We seek to develop medicines and products that can produce positive real-world outcomes for patients and healthcare providers. The benefits can range from improving the cost-­effectiveness of high-quality care to pro­longing lives. We are developing services and technol­o­gies to augment the benefits of our core products, often in collaboration with healthcare providers and technology companies.
Growing areas of healthcare
We aim to develop innovative products in growing areas of healthcare where we can make a real difference. We focus on patented medicines, generic medicines and eye care – segments where we have the innovation power and global scale necessary to compete effectively. At the same time, we are expanding our presence in the emerging markets of Asia, Africa and Latin America, where there is fast-growing demand for access to high- quality medicines and healthcare.
