Our R&D challenge - creating original ideas to turn today's dreams into tomorrow's reality
Without new challenges a company cannot grow. Shin-Etsu Chemical values the power of R&D as an important asset that leads as we carve a path into the future. While asking ourselves, "What do our customers need now?" and "What is the market looking for?" we continuously engage in research and development to fulfill present demands. All the while we are actively pursuing further research to raise the quality and production efficiency of our previously developed products.
The Triangular Link: Sales, R&D and Production

Shin-Etsu Chemical's R&D is being directed in a way that closely suits our customers' needs. What makes this possible is Shin-Etsu's R&D system, which integrates business, development and production. Market demands generated by our business activities are relayed to our development divisions, where they are used to establish research themes. The development divisions follow these themes as they progress. At the same time they maintain close ties with the manufacturing divisions and conduct practical R&D aimed at utilizing our plants and facilities for mass production. In order to do this efficiently, Shin-Etsu Chemical has established R&D centers at each plant, which ties them in closely with each business and manufacturing division.
Materials Development with Originality - Creating New Value
In conducting our R&D, we focus on original themes. Our first goal with these themes is to meet the next generation of needs and, secondly, show originality in doing something that has never been attempted. Some of these carefully selected themes have led to the invention of new materials that we were the first to mass produce. These materials have solved problems in various industrial fields by providing unique properties and excellent functionalities, while leading to industry-changing breakthroughs. We will continue to take on the challenge of developing new materials wherever the need exists.

Company's History
Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd. began with the coming together of Nagano Prefecture's (Shinano-area) water and Niigata Prefecture's (Echigo-area) limestone.
Nagano Prefecture's plentiful water give birth to electric power and the limestone that came from Niigata Prefecture was a key raw material, which was called, "Oyashirazu's great earth."

Because of the presence of these two gifts of nature, Shin-Etsu Nitrogen Fertilizer Co., Ltd. was founded on September, 1926 to manufacture chemical fertilizer and limestone nitrogen. The history of Shin-Etsu Chemical Co., Ltd. began from this point.The company's "Shin" comes from Shinano and "Etsu" is taken from Echigo.

Quality Control
Our goal - to be your best partner by always supplying the highest quality products
Shin-Etsu Chemical considers it extremely important as a materials producer to provide a stable supply of high-quality products. High purity and cleanliness are demanded from many of the products we deliver. 
To supply cutting-edge materials, our quality control technology and system must also be cutting-edge. 
To fulfill these kinds of high-level needs, Shin-Etsu Chemical is introducing the latest analytical equipment and developing its own original quality control system, while, at the same time, building a management system to enforce this function continuously and effectively. 
As our customers' best partner, we always provide a stable supply of quality products.
Shin-Etsu Chemical's adherence to quality control rooted in receipt of Deming Prize.
The Deming Prize medal
Shin-Etsu Chemical began tackling "QC" at the relatively early date of 1950, and went to work to establish quality control methods. Then, after a mere three years, it received the Deming Prize in 1953 for its efforts. The company received an appraisal from Dr. Deming himself as having "the world's highest level" of statistical quality control. Since then, Shin-Etsu Chemical has worked to develop new products while developing a system and technology to maintain and improve the quality of our previously developed products. Since 1987, when the International Standards Organization (ISO) set forth the ISO 9000 Series of international standards for evaluation of management systems, the Shin-Etsu Group has received ISO 9000 certification at almost all of its production facilities. In addition, Shin-Estu is regularly executing quality audits of each facility's products. We are meeting the needs of the times through unflagging pursuit of quality control.
ISO 9001 Certification of the Shin-Etsu Group(44kb)
Meeting customer's high-level needs with Shin-Etsu's Six Sigma program
Six Sigma
*
, a quality control method based on statistical analysis of data which is targeted at reducing the percentage of faulty products, is attracting a great deal of attention as a new management initiative to improve quality. 
Shin-Etsu Chemical started its Six Sigma program in 2000. Shin-Etsu's Six Sigma program fuses the company's past experiences with the concepts and methods of Six Sigma. It is already steadily achieving good results.
Shin-Etsu will continue to improve quality control levels using diverse approaches, as it strives to meet the high-level needs of its customers. At the same time, Shin-Etsu will promote the raising of each and every staff members' consciousness about product quality and endeavor to enhance the productivity of all personnel.
＊
Six Sigma
The word "Six Sigma" is a statistical measure of faulty parts per million pieces manufactured. It refers to both products and business processes. The concept of Six Sigma signifies the attainment of a nearly perfect high-quality control level of 99.999997 percent, meaning that there are only 3.4 defects per million parts. This level has emerged as the benchmark for high quality-fewer than 3.5 defects per million.
