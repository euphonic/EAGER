Headway Technologies was founded in 1994 to provide advanced magneto resistive recording heads to the disk drive industry.                      Our initial focus was on the development of a different type of magneto resistive recording head known as Dual Stripe MR or DSMR.                      These products offered significant performance advantages to our customers and have been used by Seagate in their industry leading server disk drives                      and by Toshiba in their high capacity mobile disk drives.
In 1997, the Company began development of soft adjacent layer magneto resistive products in order to provide industry standard products as part of our product offerings.
During 1999, we introduced our giant magneto resistive products. Giant magneto resistive is an advanced application of magneto resistive technology.                      With these products we provide our customers with recording heads which provide information-handling capabilities unsurpassed in the industry.
On March 31, 2000, Headway Technologies was acquired by TDK Corporation, through its subsidiary SAE Corporation.                      The combination of TDK, SAE and Headway is the sole independent recording head company in the world.TDK in America
