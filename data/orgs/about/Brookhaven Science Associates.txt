About
The Department of Energy’s (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) is a significant asset to our country, through its scientific leadership and its economic impact not only on Long Island, but throughout all of New York state and the Northeast.
Brookhaven National Laboratory is managed on behalf of DOE by Brookhaven Science Associates (BSA), a partnership between Stony Brook University and Battelle . BSA also engages six of the world’s premier research universities (Columbia, Cornell, Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton and Yale) in the governance and oversight of the Laboratory. The combined strengths of these entities make significant contributions to BNL.
As a leading research university in close proximity to the BNL site, Stony Brook offers scientific collaborations, joint initiatives, and joint research appointments in BNL’s core research areas, and provides a variety of services to BNL staff. As the world’s largest nonprofit research organization and manager or co-manager of six DOE national laboratories, Battelle offers management systems and tools designed specifically for research. The affiliated research universities offer world-leading experts for scientific oversight as well as additional opportunities for research partnerships, joint appointments, and other forms of collaboration.
BSA is committed to the future of Brookhaven National Laboratory as both a world-leading scientific organization and as a source of technology innovation benefitting our region, our nation and our world.
