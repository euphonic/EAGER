HISTORY
SixPoint Materials, Inc. was founded on September 29th, 2006, as a spin-off from the Nitrides' group in the materials department at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) . The company's core technology is the ammonothermal growth of bulk GaN crystal, which was developed at UCSB under Nakamura Inhomogeneous Crystal Project in the Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology (ERATO) Program , led by Professor Nakamura the pioneer of GaN-based LEDs and laser diodes. Ammonothermal technology will provide higher quality, lower cost GaN wafers than the conventional GaN wafers produced only by hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE). This revolutionary technology will expand the usage of GaN wafers to many new applications such as low-cost LED lightings and blue/green laser diodes for compact projectors.
