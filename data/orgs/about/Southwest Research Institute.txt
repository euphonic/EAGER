10 Things to Know
In the Community
Our staff is expert at developing solutions that help build a better tomorrow today — and that practical, innovative spirit carries through to our community interactions. Staff members generously donate time and other resources to support food drives, blood drives, and other outreach programs.
Yet, as a research and development organization, the next generation of scientists and engineers is key to our continued success. We especially value programs and activities that support science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) for students. We sponsor internships and scholarships and serve as science fair judges and classroom speakers for area schools, among other activities.
An annual school supplies drive benefits a local school district in need. In 2017, staff collected enough supplies to fill 39 boxes.
SwRI participated in a donation drive and competitions against other area employers at the 2017 Corporate Cup.
SwRI holds an annual SwRI Cares volunteer day to support local United Way agencies. Staff and their family members spend a Saturday helping the community with a variety of projects.
An internal outreach committee coordinates a variety of programs, including local Special Olympic events.
Staff members and their families regularly volunteer at the San Antonio Food Bank to help sort and pack goods for distribution to area families.

Who We Are
History
Thomas Baker Slick Jr. – an adventurer, philanthropist and oilman – founded SwRI on a South Texas ranch in 1947. After recruiting talent from across the nation, he challenged his team of scientists and engineers to seek revolutionary advancements through advanced science and applied technology. That spirit lives on today. SwRI endures as one of the oldest, independent nonprofit organizations in the United States, providing innovative science, technology, and engineering services to government and commercial clients around the world.
HISTORY OF SwRI
SwRI began as a vision and developed into a reality beyond our founder’s wildest dreams. What started out as a small operation on a converted cattle ranch has grown to more than 2 million square feet of state-of-the-art laboratories, facilities, and offices.
HISTORY OF SwRI’S SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
1947-1967
1967-1987
1987-2007
2007-Present
1947-1967
Founder Tom Slick recruits Harold Vagtborg as the first president to lead scientists and engineers at a 1,200-acre cattle ranch outside San Antonio. SwRI grows from 64 projects to 600 in the first five years, gaining national prominence for automotive testing, environmental research, and radio direction finding. Annual revenues reach $4.5 million by 1957. Martin Goland becomes president in 1959.
1967-1987
SwRI expands its research capabilities as a pioneer, setting standards in fields such as microencapsulation, space research, oil and gas, ocean engineering, nondestructive evaluation, emissions, and materials research. During the 1970s, SwRI develops new research and safety standards for emissions, fire, and air pollution. The Institute grows and expands in the 1980s into new areas including direction finding, aviation systems, automation, artificial intelligence, and manufacturing.
1987-2007
J. Dan Bates is named president in November 1997. By 2000, SwRI ushers in its first major space mission, the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE), paving the way for more NASA projects. Revenue reaches $270 million in 1997 and continues to grow during Bates’ tenure to $592 million in 2014, the same year Bates retires after serving 17 years as president. SwRI rapidly expands work on robotics, intelligent systems, machinery dynamics, intelligent transportation systems, and space science.
2007-Present
Adam L. Hamilton, P.E., becomes the Institute’s fourth president in 2014. He leads 2,602 scientists, engineers, and support staff members. SwRI gains worldwide attention by leading NASA missions such as the New Horizons mission to Pluto, Juno mission to Jupiter, Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, and Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX). SwRI is also a leader in fuel and energy efficiency, geosciences, turbomachinery, automated driving systems, and energy storage.
