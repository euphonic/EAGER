The E Ink logo uses "Duality" as our design theme. We embrace technological advances while respecting human life, human culture and human nature. E Ink emphasizes the cultural legacy passed on by technology.
The drop of ink on the top right of the "E" represents what writing means to cultural heritage. The connection of the ink drop and the "E" represent the merging of traditional printed text with electronic media.
The logo typeface is firm and steady representing the accuracy of technology. However, the corners are presented in an "analog-like" curve which is more human.
