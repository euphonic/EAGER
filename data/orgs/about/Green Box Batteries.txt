Buy It, Fill It, Ship It.  That's It!
With the Big Green Box, it is no longer necessary to pay large fees to waste management companies, fill out complicated paperwork, or look tirelessly around your city or county for a responsible drop-off location. Thanks to the Big Green Box, it is now easy to do the right thing with your used batteries and portable electronics!
Using the Big Green Box is as simple as a three-step process:
BUY IT - Once purchased, the Big Green Box will be shipped to your home, office or business, completely assembled and ready to be set in any location of your choosing.
FILL IT - Your Big Green Box comes with a set of plastic bags. As batteries and other electronic devices are used up, simply place the individual items in a separate bag and set them inside the Box (bags prevent unintentional discharges or short circuits).
SHIP IT - Once your Big Green Box is full, or a year has passed since placing the first item into the Box, just drop it off at your local FedEx location, or call 1-800-Go-FedEx to have your box picked up from your home or place of business, free of charge.
THAT’S IT! The Big Green Box is specifically designed to be a simple, convenient process for you to recycle your batteries and electronics.
