About
Amgen  is committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from  serious illnesses by discovering, developing, manufacturing and delivering  innovative human therapeutics. This approach begins by using tools like  advanced human genetics to unravel the complexities of disease and understand  the fundamentals of human biology.
Our  belief—and the core of our strategy—is that innovative, highly differentiated  medicines that provide large clinical benefits in addressing serious diseases  are medicines that will not only help patients, but also will help reduce the  social and economic burden of disease in society today.
Amgen  focuses on areas of high unmet medical need and leverages its expertise to  strive for solutions that improve health outcomes and dramatically improve  people's lives. A biotechnology innovator since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one  of the world's leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached  millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines  with breakaway potential.
Innovative Medicines
We have a presence in  approximately 100 countries and regions worldwide and our innovative medicines have reached  millions of people in the fight against serious illnesses. We focus on six  therapeutic areas: cardiovascular disease, oncology, bone health, neuroscience,  nephrology and inflammation. Our medicines typically address diseases for which  there are limited treatment options, or they are medicines that provide a  viable option to what is otherwise available.
Transformative Research
Understanding the fundamental  biological mechanisms of disease is a defining feature of Amgen's discovery  research efforts—and a major contributor to the development of Amgen's deep and  broad pipeline of potential new medicines. Amgen's "biology first" approach  permits its scientists to first explore the complex molecular pathways of  disease before determining what type of medicine, or modality, is most likely  to deliver optimal efficacy and safety. With the advances in human genetics,  Amgen continues to shed new light on the molecular roots of disease. Amgen  subsidiary deCODE Genetics, a global leader in human genetics, is a powerful  differentiator, greatly improving how we identify and validate human disease  targets.
World-Class Biomanufacturing
The treatment of millions of seriously ill patients  worldwide depends on the safe and reliable production of biologic medicines,  which are administered by injection or intravenously. A worldwide leader in  biologics manufacturing, Amgen has an outstanding track record of reliably  delivering high-quality medicines to patients who need them. Significant skill,  experience, vigilance and commitment are critical to help ensure the quality of  a biologic medicine each time a new batch is made. At Amgen, robust quality  control and a reliable supply of medicines for patients are every bit as  important as scientific innovation.

How We Operate
Letter from Cynthia Patton, Amgen's Chief Compliance Officer
Cynthia Patton, Amgen's

Amgen is a company full of passionate and committed people. Having an opportunity to help people is very motivating, and knowing we can make a difference in a patient’s health is inspiring. Each of us knows and understands the responsibility we have in the healthcare industry. Our mission, to serve patients, is supported by our commitment to conducting business ethically and ensuring compliance with the laws and regulations that govern our business and industry. Amgen’s leadership, including its Board of Directors, is committed to promoting an ethical culture.


As Amgen’s Chief Compliance Officer, I oversee our Worldwide Compliance & Business Ethics Program, which is grounded in 
our Values
. At Amgen, it is everyone’s responsibility to do the right thing by conducting business ethically, and we take it very seriously. There are a number of resources available that help staff members do the right thing, including: Amgen’s 
Code of Conduct
; compliance websites and training courses; Amgen's compliance policies; guidance from managers and dedicated compliance professionals; and Amgen's 
Business Conduct Hotline

We recognize there is a broad range of stakeholders who have an interest in how we manage and operate our business. We are pleased to share with you an overview of our Worldwide Compliance & Business Ethics Program.
