SERE Inc., an      energy research and development company, develops products that      fill underserved energy markets, focus on system efficiency      improvements and abate climate change through green house gas      (GHG) emission reductions. 
SERE's mission      statement is to only provide energy systems that can stand alone      without government subsidies, greatly reduce business energy      costs, job growth in the U.S.A., reduce or eliminate GHG and a      better standard of living for all.
Future      development will provide a series of EnviroGEN electric generators covering larger micro-grid single units,      modular power plant applications and smaller use systems      approaching residential needs.  Solar power farms along      with solar desalinization will follow the generator market.       Throughout commercialization and beginning manufacturing both GHG      abatement and CO2 conversion and capture products will be      pursued through reinvestment in R&D.
SERE believes      business viability can coexists with beneficial      environmental impact and still flourish.
