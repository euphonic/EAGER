What is Solder Resist?
Taiyo Group Technology
Taiyo Group Accumulated Technology
Formulation Technology
"Formulation Technology" refers to the accurate, efficient, and prompt development of the optimal combination of materials from amongst countless prospective candidates (e.g. synthetic resins, fillers, etc.) in order to achieve the various characteristics and performance required by products.
Mixing and Dispersion Technology
"Mixing and Dispersion Technology" refers to the manufacture of uniformly-dispersed and precisely-balanced ink formulations. In recent years, in conjunction with the ever-decreasing size of electronics, finer ink dispersions have become increasingly more critical and required.
Taiyo Group Main Proprietary Fundamental Technology
Leveraging its photolithography and insulation technology, Taiyo Group has built its foundations on solder resist and other printed wiring board materials. 
Through the use of our photolithography technology, and adaptation of our conductive technology, Taiyo Group is developing the area of flat panel display materials as our secondary product group. 
We intend to develop new product groups, such as the electronic and optical component groups, by further expanding our fundamental technologies including adhesive and thermal management technologies.
Global Network
Doing Business with the Global Market
Printed wiring boards (PWBs) are produced all over the world. The map of the industry is continually changing, with rapid growth of the PWB market in Asia, and particularly in China. Taiyo Group deals with PWB manufacturers the world over, and considers that responding to such changes in the global environment and continually supplying superior products and services is vital.
Global Network
In this challenging business environment, Taiyo Group aims to provide the global marketplace with optimal production bases and marketing channels. The company network system covers every corner of the globe, with production and marketing centers in Japan, China, Taiwan, Korea, and the USA, and marketing and technical support centers in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Thailand.
Group Companies
Overseas Sales Ratio of 80%
Currently, an approximately 80% of total sales is accounted for by overseas sales. Global demand for electronic equipment is expected to increase in the mid and long term. Taiyo Group will pursue business deployment as an international company, and will be proactive in attracting world demand.

History
History
Establishment (1953) to 1980s
1990s
2000s
Establishment (1953) to 1980s
1953
Sep.
Taiyo Ink Mfg. Co., Ltd. established.
Taiyo Ink was established as a manufacturing and marketing company for printing ink in Minato-ku, Tokyo.

                        In Japanese, "taiyo" means "sun". The name was decided on because it reflects our desire to be a useful existence for people everywhere and bring light to the world like the sun, which gives its blessings to all life on earth.
1970
Aug.
Commenced printed wiring board (PWB) marketing.
1973
May.
Developed and commenced marketing of epoxy resin, thermally curable single-component solder resist.
1976
Radical change in business policy
In a radical change in business policy, the company decided to switch from printing ink, its traditional mainstay since its founding, to solder resist products and other chemical materials for the electronics industry. At the time, the chemical materials business was still in the trial and error stage and the marketability of these products was unknown; the future of the company therefore rested on this decision.
1982
Mar.
Ranzan Plant (current Ranzan Facility) established.
The production capacity of the Niiza Plant, the company's main production facility at the time, was stretched to the limit on a daily basis due to the rapid rise in solder resist shipments to meet demand from foreign importers and others. The company decided to establish the Ranzan Plant, which has five times the site area of the Niiza Plant, in Ranzan-machi, Hiki-gun, Saitama Prefecture, drastically increasing its production capacity.
1984
Jun.
Exhibited liquid developable solder resist at the JPCA Show.
The company exhibited a more accurate developable solder resist capable of responding to increased density in printed wiring board production. The following year in 1985, the company developed the current standard liquid alkaline developable solder resist (PSR-4000) and applied for a basic patent. This patent was first granted in the UK in 1989, then in the USA, France, and Germany before being registered in Japan in 1993. Application patents have been registered from 1990 onwards in key countries.
1988
Sep.
Established
TAIYO INK MFG. CO., (KOREA) LTD.
