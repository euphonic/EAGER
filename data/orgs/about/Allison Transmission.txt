Copyright 2018 Allison Transmission Inc.Celebrating A Century Of Reliability
As the world’s largest manufacturer of fully automatic transmissions, Allison Transmission has a lot to celebrate during its 100-year anniversary. Allison has a rich history within our home community in Indianapolis and is working to become a bigger part of the communities we serve around the globe.
100 Years of Business
Allison Transmission traces its corporate lineage back to the founding of the Indianapolis Speedway Team Company on September 14, 1915. As a co-founder of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and part owner of several racing teams, James A. Allison, a prominent innovator and entrepreneurial businessman, established a precision machine shop and experimental firm on Main Street in Speedway called the Allison Experimental Company to support his racing endeavors.
In the years that followed, the company evolved from working on race cars to becoming a leading manufacturer of aircraft engines, locomotive products, and, beginning in the mid-1940s, automatic transmissions.
“Our company was founded on the values of innovation, quality and reliability. Although 100 years have passed, I’m very proud to say those remain our driving values today. With our products and services, we are improving the way the world works.”
—Lawrence E. Dewey, Chairman and CEO
