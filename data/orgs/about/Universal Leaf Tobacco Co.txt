Reflecting on all that’s occurred since our founding, one thought seems to sum it up better than others—it’s been quite a ride!  As the following timeline demonstrates, ours is a history defined by forward progress, often in spite of the uncertainty around us.   Through 100 years characterized by economic anxiety, geo-political turmoil and breathtaking technological change, Universal has managed to adapt to changing agricultural practices, build a global presence, embrace state of the art technology and emerge as the recognized industry leader.
We’re indebted to those who’ve traveled with us—our investors, our employees, our growers and, especially, our customers.  To all we say, "thank you".   We’re grateful for your confidence, your help, your friendship and our relationships.  And, we hope you’ll continue with us on the journey ahead.

Throughout its 100-year history, Universal has built a global presence, responded to changing agricultural practices, made significant investments in the quality of life for many of its more than 24,000 workers, embraced state of the art technology and emerged as the recognized industry leader. In the process, we’ve learned some things that we believe will direct us as we enter the next chapter of our company’s continuing story. So, we invite you to journey with us on the pathway to the future considering the following principles that will guide us:
Companies don’t build businesses, people do
At Universal, management has charted a course through depression, wars and geo-political upheavals.   Along the way, our people have provided the energy and enthusiasm necessary to navigating the past and confronting the future.
Relationships last
They are the very fabric of what we do.  Over the years, handshakes have signaled relationships built upon trust and loyalty. And, although today’s legal environment requires written agreements, those sealed with handshakes still signal the kind of relationships that will last, not just for a while but for decades to come.
Do the right thing the right way
Universal has become known for doing what it says it will do.  When we take a position, make a promise or guarantee a result, you can count on us to deliver.  Our fundamental promise is to do business in the future in the very same way—the right way.
A company is known for what it values
Consider our core beliefs, and you’ll understand the values that define us.  They underpin the actions we take every day to cultivate and strengthen the various communities we depend on—growers, investors, employees and, most importantly, our customers.  In short, we practice what we preach—that’s just what leaders do.
Every action affects others
We call that “The Ripple Effect”, and it is manifest in every decision we make.  Every action gives rise to another….and another….and another….and so on.  Consider this example.  We provide a grower with training and crop analytics technology that results in better yields and, in turn, a more prosperous farmer better equipped to help improve the quality of life in his community.  We work every day to take such actions mindful of the rippling impacts they will have on the lives of people, the needs of our investors, the requirements of our customers, the sustainability of our practices and the health of our planet.Success Requires a Solid Foundation
You can learn a lot about a company by understanding what it values and how it does business.  At Universal, our beliefs reflect where we’ve been and what we’ve learned over our nearly 100 years of history.   Taken together, they define the very core of who we are, a glimpse into our company’s soul, if you will.  And, more than just words, at Universal they dictate the way we do business every day.
We believe in our responsibility to make a sustainable impact on our planet.
We believe in the value of cultivating communities through responsible partnerships.
We believe that focusing on the success of suppliers and customers is good business for us.
We believe in adopting sustainable agricultural practices responsive to the needs of farmers and the environment.
We believe in setting the standards for providing compliant products in a transparent manner.
We believe that our global workforce provides the energy that fuels our business.
We believe in maintaining the financial strength necessary to support our communities.
We believe in seeking and developing business opportunities that fit our core competencies.
We believe in learning from the past in order to avoid problems in the future.
We believe in doing what we say we will do.Steering a Course to the Future
Read a brief letter from our Chairman and get to know a leadership team who, like those before them, is guided by a simple principle — carefully manage the present while thoughtfully planning for the future.
Message from the Chairman
Dear Friends of Universal,
I am pleased to announce that Universal Corporation celebrated its 100th anniversary on January 25, 2018.  It is an important milestone for our Company, and a testament to the long-running and continued support and importance of our vital communities— employees, investors, customers, and growers.
Throughout our 100 year history, we have been finding innovative solutions to serve our customers and meet their leaf tobacco needs.  We have grown from a collection of leaf tobacco dealers in the United States to a global business that spans five continents.  We are proud to be the leading global leaf supplier and the recognized industry leader. I believe that we accomplished this feat by operating throughout our long history with integrity, honesty, and a focus on quality. We are a vital link in the leaf tobacco supply chain.
We are looking forward to our next 100 years and seek to build on the many lessons that we’ve learned on our journey thus far by seeking opportunities to leverage both our assets and expertise.  We will continue our commitment to leadership in setting industry standards, operating with transparency, providing products that are responsibly-sourced, and investing in and strengthening the communities in which we operate.  We thank you for your continued support.
Sincerely,

Managing interest expense and capital costs provides a competitive advantage, affording us flexibility when responding to customer requirements and market changes.TOBACCO AND MORE

(CIFI), opened the doors of its new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in late 2015. CIFI produces quality liquid and dehydrated fruit and vegetable products, including concentrated and non-concentrated juices, purees, and flours.  CIFI’s primary focus is to derive value added ingredients from sweet potatoes. Sweet potatoes are non-GMO, gluten free, high in beta-carotene and vitamin C. They are also an important source of fiber and protein. Sweet Potatoes are widely used in food preparation and food manufacturing processes for items such as baked goods, purees, soups and other preparations. New and innovative uses for sweet potatoes, particularly in the growing health and wellness beverage market and the global pet food industry, are continuously occurring. We believe the demand for this versatile product as an essential part of new formulations will continue to grow.
CIFI is located in North Carolina where nearly half of all sweet potatoes in the United States are grown. Being located close to the source allows us to optimize supply logistics for the freshest products as well as manage the supply chain and traceability aspects of our business that are so important for food safety and adherence to good agricultural practices programs.
Juice products can be aseptically packaged, chilled, or frozen in drums, totes, or bulk. Aseptic processing will be processed to FDA standards. Dehydrated products can be packaged in bulk, bins and bag-in-box. The new facility is certified for organic and kosher production. All production is to human food standards, and we offer the capability of customer specific product customization as part of our production process.
Carolina Innovative Food Ingredients, Inc. offers broad product and technical capabilities including the dehydration and juicing of fruit and vegetables. All of our products are grown, produced and manufactured in the United States.
