Vision and Culture

	Our vision for Siluria is to enable better use of the world’s resources by providing a broad set of technology solutions across the energy industry. Our primary vehicle to accomplish this vision is the combination of three characteristics:

	Our culture is very open and transparent. We emphasize an all-for-one, one-for-all team philosophy in our work approach. We don’t accept “it has been tried and can’t be done.” We value diversity in our people, their experiences, and in our thinking.
