Background
Thomas Edison said, “Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.” Edison’s credo has significant resonance for Optodot president Dr. Steve Carlson, who forged a friendship with the inventor’s son, Theodore Edison, in the 1980s. Edison’s inventions revolutionized life in the 20th century. Since its founding in 2000, Optodot has been matching its advanced materials technologies to the pressing needs of the 21st century world market.
Optodot continually seeks to innovate in the commercialization of next generation products based on nanoporous membranes and infrared (IR) organic coatings. Our discoveries in this field have produced a wide range of products for commercial, government, and military applications.
Since its founding in 2000, Optodot has worked both with private-sector companies (from startups to Global 100’s) and with federal agencies, such as the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy. Optodot continues to seek business partners and licensees to commercialize products for better energy, security, and communications solutions that benefit people and our planet.
