Nearly 70 years of Innovation
With a nearly 70-year legacy of game-changing innovation, our company has developed new products and technologies that serve as the bedrock of the chemical industry. Below are some of our key contributions.
1953-1954
Predecessor company scientists Karl Ziegler and Giulio Natta make breakthrough discoveries in the creation of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). PE and PP resins are used today to make numerous products, including automobile parts, surgical gowns, children’s toys, wind turbines and water pipes. They were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1963.
1955
Hoechst, a predecessor company, initiated industrial-scale production of PE in Frankfurt, Germany.
1969
Predecessor company, Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO), develops the PO/TBA process (propylene oxide with tertiary butyl alcohol as the co-product). PO is used in numerous applications including bedding, furniture, carpets and car seats. TBA and its derivatives, which includes oxyfuels, are used in high octane gasoline blending components, synthetic rubber and lubricant additives.
1975
First Hostalen high density polyethylene (HDPE) process plant starts up.
1982
2001
Basell completes start-up of the world’s largest low density polyethylene plant (LDPE) in Berre, France, with a single line capacity of 320,000 tons per year.
2017
LyondellBasell begins construction of the first commercial Hyperzone PE plant in La Porte, Texas, utilizing the company’s new proprietary technology. HDPE plastics produced using the Hyperzone PE process technology exhibit enhanced characteristics including superior toughness properties that make end-use products less likely to break or tear. Potential end-use products include healthcare packaging, high pressure pipe, children’s toys, household bottles and intermediate bulk containers.

Expansion Projects
Since 2012, LyondellBasell has made significant investments to expand capacity at key global manufacturing sites. In 2016, we completed a multi-year project to increase annual ethylene capacity in the U.S. by two billion pounds, which resulted in an overall 20 percent increase in U.S. ethylene capacity.
2012
120 million pounds-per-year combined ethylene/polyethylene increase – Clinton, Iowa and Morris, Illinois
2013
155 million pounds-per-year butadiene increase – Wesseling, Germany
250 million gallons-per-year methanol increase – Channelview, Texas
2014
800 million pounds-per-year ethylene increase – La Porte, Texas
220 million pounds-per-year polyethylene increase – Matagorda, Texas
2015
250 million pounds-per-year ethylene increase – Channelview, Texas
2016
800 million pounds-per-year ethylene increase – Corpus Christi, Texas
Greenfield Projects
In 2017, LyondellBasell started construction of the first commercial 
Hyperzone
 polyethylene (PE) plant located at our existing La Porte, Texas, complex. The new plant will be capable of producing 1.1 billion pounds (500,000 metric tons) of high density polyethylene (HDPE) annually and will employ LyondellBasell's new proprietary 
Hyperzone
 PE technology, which produces HDPE plastic resins that have improved characteristics. Startup of the plant is planned for 2019.
Additionally, plans for a world-scale propylene oxide and tertiary butyl alcohol (PO/TBA) plant at the company's Channelview site are progressing. The project is expected to produce 1 billion pounds-per-year of propylene oxide and 2.3 billion pounds-per-year of tertiary butyl alcohol.
