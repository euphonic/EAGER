MDL specializes in high complexity, state-of-the-art, automated DNA-based molecular analysis. By utilizing molecular techniques, MDL is able to provide clinicians from many different specialties valuable diagnostic information to assist in the detection, diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of bacterial, viral and fungal infections as well as genetic based testing and cancer diagnostics. For example, the unique testing MDL offers for the specialties of Urology, Gynecology and Pediatric Medicine enables the detection of multiple pathogens as well as certain drug resistance profiles from a single swab by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing. MDL’s primary focus is in the fields of infectious disease testing for Women’s Health and Gynecology, Pediatric Respiratory Infections, Urology, Vector-borne Diseases, Mycology and chronic illnesses.
MDL is comprised of experts in the fields of Molecular Biology, Immunology, Virology, Microbiology, Mycology, Pharmacogenomics, Antimicrobial Resistance and Oncology. In addition to developing and validating new clinical diagnostic tests, the Research and Development Department also publishes research projects in peer-reviewed journals, presents scientific information at international symposia, and performs contractual research work for major commercial, governmental, and academic organizations.
To this end, MDL invites you to contact us with your ongoing needs for molecular medicine, as this field continues to grow.

The aim of the first three divisions is to identify potential pathogenic agents clinically germane to their respective focus of interest. Once identified, diagnostic tests are designed for their identification in clinical specimens sampled using MDL’s proprietary OneSwab®, UroSwab® and NasoSwab™ technologies, as well as other medias, including blood, synovial and cerebrospinal fluids and ThinPrep. Dividing the pathogenic agents clinically allows MDL to concentrate their efforts upon medically relevant infectious agents that meet the needs of both the physician and the individual through our extensive testing menus and rapid reporting times. MDL’s goal is to aid the physician in planning their course of treatment. Antibiotic resistance is a naturally occurring phenomenon that renders certain antibiotics, often times the treatment of choice, useless. As antibiotic resistant agents are identified, MDL modifies its testing procedures to include reflexive testing that enables physicians to modify their treatment strategies. Such advanced diagnostic testing is already available for ciprofloxacin-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, clindamycin and erythromycin resistant Group B Streptococcus, amantadine-resistant influenza A, and clarithromycin-resistant Helicobacter pylori.
Cytogenetics represents a new area of focus for MDL. Within this group, tests are being designed and validated for the identification of carriers of inheritable diseases. Initial tests under development are those most common in Ashkenazi Jewish populations. Our initial release screens for Cystic Fibrosis carrier status in OneSwab® and buccal swabs.
