April 2018
Symantec has the largest civilian threat collection network in the world which records events from 126.5 million attack sensors worldwide, and monitors threat activities in over 157 countries and territories.

Innovation is in our DNA, essential to our culture. The attackers are both innovative and relentless. And they only have to be right once—we have to defend against the onslaught, day in, day out. It's fundamental to our culture at Symantec that we're never done: we must innovate to stay two steps ahead of the bad actors.

Cyber criminals today are relentless, and they only need to be successful once. With each passing year, not only does the sheer volume of threats increase, but the threat landscape becomes more diverse.
From the explosion of coinmining activity in 2018, to the 600% rise in targeted activity against IoT devices, attackers are still working relentlessly to discover new avenues to infect networks and steal data, while also covering their tracks.
Join Orla Cox, Director of Security Response at Symantec for this insight-packed webinar, including:
• How targeted attacks are evolving to exploit new technologies like IoT.
• The increasing diversity of cyber attacks, and the new method that hackers are using to infect networks and steal information
• A roundup of the year’s most high-profile attacks, and a look at what to expect in the year to come

View More Cloud computing enables companies to be more agile and squeeze the inefficiencies out of the development cycle, such as procuring compute resources on demand rather than waiting for IT. But as companies move fast to deliver new products, security must move faster to keep up with new regulations and threats – or risk slowing down the business.
Cloud configuration errors can lead to gaping holes in cloud infrastructure deployments and present low hanging fruit for hackers. Security and DevOps teams need a proactive, automated approach to monitoring and securing their cloud management plane.
Join us for this informative webinar on how to achieve security compliance for public cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platforms such as AWS and Microsoft Azure.
During this webinar, you'll learn:
