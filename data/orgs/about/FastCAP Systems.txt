Nanoramic’s technology is derived from years of government funded research and development in advanced materials including the application of carbon nanotubes in electrochemical systems as well as dispersion, compounding and coating processes for composites of nanotubes and other carbons.  Based on a deep knowledge of nanocarbon materials, processes, and applications, we have demonstrated success in polymer-based composites, thermal interface materials, and binderless electrodes for energy storage.
Nanoramic's ultracapacitor division, FastCAP Ultracapacitors, is an industry leader in harsh environment energy storage, producing the only ultracapacitors capable of operating in temperatures up to 150C and under conditions of high shock and vibration.
