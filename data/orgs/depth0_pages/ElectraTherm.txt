I feel that what you stand for and the work that your company does is one of the best experiences that I have ever had the opportunity to work with. You do it right, you care about what you do and how it effects people. 
Matthew Scott
City of Unalaska, Alaska
ElectraTherm has developed a compact ORC machine able to generate electricity from low-temperature waste heat by using an organic working fluid. The inclusion of the ORC utilizes heat that would otherwise go to waste. In addition to biogas, ElectraTherm’s ORC technology works especially well with satellite combined heat and power (CHP), district heating systems and geothermal applications.
