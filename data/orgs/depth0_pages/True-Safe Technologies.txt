FAQs
What Is Food Intolerance?
Certain foods trigger intolerance in the digestive tract making it unable to break down or digest. A good example is lactose intolerance where the digestive system can not process or break down lactose, a sugar found in milk and other dairy products. Some reasons for food intolerance include not having the proper enzymes to digest certain foods, reaction to food ingredients and additives such as sulfides, MSG and food colors, pharmacological factors such as sensitivity to caffeine or other substances, sensitivity to sugars naturally found in certain foods like onions, broccoli, and Brussel sprouts, among others.
What Is The Difference Between Food Intolerance and Food Allergy?
The difference between  
Food Allergy
 and 
Food Intolerance
 is in the body’s response. With food allergy, the body’s immune system causes the reaction. With food intolerance, the digestive system triggers the reaction.  Allergy manifests itself almost immediately after inhalation or ingestion of a particular substance, whereas, with food intolerance , symptoms may occur within hours or even days, depending on individuals.
Food allergies are very common and generally confused with food intolerance as they could have similar symptoms.
Food Allergy is a condition wherein certain foods trigger an abnormal response in our body’s immune system. It is caused by the immune system wrongly recognizing some of the proteins in a food as harmful, triggering a reaction by launching a range of defense measures, including releasing chemicals such as histamine which causes inflammation. Food intolerance on the other hand,  does not involve the immune system meaning that while they can severely impact the quality of life, they are typically not life-threatening.
What Are Some Common Symptoms of Food Intolerance
Symptoms of food intolerance vary, although they are all digestion-related which includes gas, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, stomach cramps, nausea, weakness, among others.
