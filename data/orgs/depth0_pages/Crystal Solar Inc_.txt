            Crystal Solar
has developed a breakthrough monocrystalline Silicon wafer technology  which fundamentally alters the cost-efficiency equation for photovoltaics.  This R&D 100 award winning, 
Direct Gas to Wafer
™ technology allows for high-efficiency solar panels at radically lower costs with:
50% less silicon
usage compared to conventional silicon due to the kerfless nature
Demonstrated cell efficincies of > 24%
At least 10% increase in power at the module
 when compared to conventional mono silicon photovoltaic       technology 
Less than 50% of the capital cost
compared to conventional monocrystalline silicon wafer technology 
The company has established  a semi-automated pilot line to demonstrate the manufacturing-worthiness and  scalability of this technology.

The company has premier strategic partnerships with global players in the  solar, chemical and semiconductor spaces. In addition, it is the recipient of  multi-million dollar research awards by the U.S. Department of Energy.
