We are excited to be moving forward focused exclusively on the Yield10 Bioscience mission to address the challenge of 
global food security
. Yield10 is in the business of “building better plants” to achieve step-change increases in the yield of major food and feed crops. Our 
two discovery platforms
 have provided us with a strong pipeline of traits where we are focused on translating initial encouraging yield improvement results in Camelina to canola, soybean, rice and corn.
