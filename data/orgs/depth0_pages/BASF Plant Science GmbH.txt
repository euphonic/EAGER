Using technology for precise agriculture
Farming today is more complex than ever before. The unpredictability  of the weather, control of pest and weeds, market price development,  scarcity of natural resources, all this in a world heading toward 9  billion people. These challenges demand BASF to continue its commitment  to creating innovative solutions for growers, supporting them with the  task of nurturing a hungry planet.
