Floadia provides scalable, cost effective and high quality eNVM IPs.

All Floadia products share the concept of “LEE”, which stands for Low cost and Easily Embedded.
Products
Floadia products all use “FN tunneling” mechanism for program and erase operation, 
which will result in very low power therefore very short test time as you can program the whole memory area at once.

They also allow very short baking time to further cut cost down.

All of Floadia products are capable of handling high temperature for automotive grade requirement.
Low Cost MTP solution for a few KBytes requirement.

20 years@150C, AEC-Q100
LEE Flash ZT
Simple Low Cost SONOS Flash. Available in affordable 90nm foundry process. 

Few masks and short test/bake.
LEE Flash G1
Next Generation Flash device, based on SONOS architecture, enabling small size, low power and direct connection with digital circuit which opens up new possibiities.
LEE Flash G2
Our Mission!
Our mission is to make embedded Flash technology affordable and easy to use, so that every chip on earth will benefit from this great technology.

CEO & President：Kosuke Okuyama
Our Innovation!
We’ve developed a new embedded FLASH that could change modern chip design approach & computer architecture, yet very simple and easy to manufacture.

Chairman：Koichi Nagasawa
Our expertise!
We are a team of engineers that have been developing NVM for more than 3 decades.
CTO：Yasuhiro Taniguchi
Technology

								Floadia’s G1 and G2 are based on SONOS memory architecture,

which has many advantages over widely used Split Gate memory architecture.
