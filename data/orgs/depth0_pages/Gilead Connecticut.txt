SERVING INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES LIVING WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS IN MIDDLESEX COUNTY SINCE 1968
For people who experience a mental health condition, healing may take years, possibly spread over the course of a lifetime. Gilead Community Services understands that the path to recovery and independence is not always straight, fast or smooth. Gilead’s services are designed to meet the challenges and needs of individuals, helping each to find the way for the long run. Since 1970, friends, neighbors and family members have found a path to a more meaningful life because Gilead, with the support of many, has enabled that progress.
