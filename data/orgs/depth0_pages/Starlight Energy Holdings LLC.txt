Simply Fit - It’s That Easy
Fitness and health should be our main priorities. However, instead of exercising regularly, we like to postpone our running or gym appointments to another day.

Who We Are:
 Starlight Energy Corporation is a technology-driven oil and gas
production company using innovative methods to efficiently bring stranded gas
resources to market. 
How We Deliver:
 The Company employs
established geophysical and recovery technologies to develop known gas and oil reserves,
focusing on sites where gas stranded for lack of a gathering system was bypassed in prior
decades. Gas is
converted directly to electricity for delivery into the electric grid, while oils
and liquids are delivered to market using conventional systems. 
Our Future:
 Starlight is developing energy conversion
methods to create highly efficient site-to-grid pipeline
alternatives. Combining emergent technologies with green energy initiatives and economic credits, Starlight is positioning itself as an integral component of the distributed energy grid of the future. 
Our Management:
 The Company’s executive
management team has over 60 years combined senior executive experience in the oil and gas
industry. In addition, with extensive entrepreneurial
backgrounds, they have successfully built, expanded and sold multiple corporations and properties.
