Quantum Dots Enabling Advanced Lighting Technology
Pacific Light Technologies is a technology company developing and manufacturing high performance nanomaterials as alternatives to conventional phosphors in solid-state lighting and display applications. By replacing phosphors, our on-chip quantum dot products boost LED efficacy by up to 30% while simultaneously achieving high CRI (90+) and high R9 (50+) values. Â Built-in encapsulation layers mean that our quantum dots are designed from the ground up to withstand the rigors of on-chip operation.
