In an effort to electronically mimic neurons—the nerve cells of the brain—scientists from HRL Laboratories, LLC have successfully demonstrated novel electronic neuron circuits that exhibits as many as 23 known behaviors of biological neurons and the three classes of neuron activation (excitation) that code information between neurons about sensory events, cognitive processes, or motor actions.
Novel Memristor Neuron Circuits Offer Building Blocks  for Mimicking the Brain
HRL Laboratories, LLC, researchers have achieved a major advancement in radio frequency switches over existing technology that will vastly accelerate data streaming in smartphones and other devices on 5G wireless networks with a more reliable signal and wider bandwidth for simultaneous data streams.
New Radio Frequency Switch  Enables Faster Video and Audio 5G Streaming
In our third episode of HRL’s History of the Future Podcast we speak with Dan Sievenpiper, a whiz-kid scientist who invented the high-impedance electromagnetic surface while he was an engineering grad student at UCLA.
HRL’s History of the Future Podcast Episode 003: Dan Sievenpiper
HRL Laboratories publish the first study using closed-loop slow-wave transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) of the brain during sleep to increase human subjects’ ability to generalize experience in a target detection task, improving overnight performance change for novel situations by about 48%.
Skills and Learning Improved by Closed-Loop Electrical Brain Stimulation During Sleep
HRL Laboratories, LLC, will leverage electronic brain-cell technology for a new computer architecture that promises more compact, energy-efficient, and capable systems. The program is part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency program Foundations Required for Novel Compute (FRANC).
All-Memristor Architecture Could Enable Brain-Like Computers
