About Pentron
You might say we were born innovators. Back in 1967, Pentron set a standard for quality and value in the dental consumables marketplace. Our goal was to stay ahead of the curve by creating technologically advanced products that would enhance the practice of dentistry. And that’s exactly what we’ve been doing ever since.
Early on, we introduced our original flowable composite, total etch bonding system, and a line of impression material that has remained popular to this day. More recent introductions have included veneer cement, liquid dentin, solvent free SE adhesive, core build up material and posts. Every day, we look forward to what’s coming next.
