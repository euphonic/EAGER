Breakthrough innovations for the packaging industry
Engineered for environmental, economic & performance benefits
Smart Planet Technologies is a materials engineering and intellectual property company focused on sustainable material advancements for the paper packaging industry.
We've changed the game.
Unlike traditional plastic-coated paper cups and other paperboard barrier packaging which ends up in our landfills due to the difficulties recyclers have processing these materials through their equipment, packaging made with EarthCoating® uses 51% less plastic and is engineered to be easily pulped into recycled paper using conventional paper recycling equipment.

Did you know?
Paper cups, food trays, folding cartons, take-out boxes, ice cream containers, food wraps and lots of other plastic-coated paperboard packaging materials are sent to the landfill.
The first step to getting paper cups and other paperboard barrier packaging recycled is to make them valuable and easy for recyclers to process through their conventional paper recycling equipment.

An overview of the Repulpability and Recyclability of paperboards with EarthCoating®
The graphic to the left illustrates the process of paper recycling. A major part of the process includes extracting and cleaning fibers from non-paper contaminants that can found in the recycled paper stream. Unlike traditional plastic coatings, EarthCoating® is engineered for efficient processing in recycling systems. EarthCoating® is designed to fracture into small, dense particles in the pulping process, thereby avoiding the challenges found with traditional plastic coatings.
