About Previvo
Our Product
Previvo offers a new choice, a new medical device, and a new procedure that empowers women and couples, both fertile and infertile, in assisted reproduction. Our proprietary and patented medical device is designed with you and your potential baby in mind. 
Our Difference
The Previvo Uterine Lavage System is the first and only medical device that allows for the recovery of 
in vivo
 conceived embryos from the uterus, prior to their implantation.  After recovery, the potential use of the embryos may include fertility preservation, genetic screening, embryo transfer, and/or embryo donation (
see guidelines from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine
).  
Our Benefits
The Previvo Uterine Lavage may provide fertile and infertile couples an alternative option to in vitro fertilization (IVF), and Previvo Uterine Lavage may also be a less invasive procedure than IVF.  We are committed to assisting you with a more natural-like fertility process.
