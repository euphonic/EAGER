Case study: Open banking payment services
Case study: Open banking payment services
Eurobits migrates to IBM Cloud, and invests in future growth
From Berlin to Bogotá, Bangkok to Boston, customers can transfer funds and make payments using any banking institution, not just their own. Account aggregation services providers must be able to share and secure account data with confidence in this more open world.
To meet that challenge, industry pioneer Eurobits sought a hybrid cloud leader with global reach. 
IBM Cloud
 offered that scalability and flexibility, allowing the company to deploy and manage APIs easily. And in an ever-changing financial world, that’s just smart dollars and sense.
