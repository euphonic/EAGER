From Ideas to Successful Companies

				Founded in 1996, Idealab is the longest running technology incubator. 
				We have created over 150 companies with more than 45 IPOs and acquisitions.
				
Great Ideas. 
Great Companies.
We believe that entrepreneurship can unlock human potential and make the world a better place.
			We look for big problems in the world that have technology solutions and test many ideas in parallel.
			When one shows great promise, we recruit a great team, spin it off into a company, and help them grow a successful business.
