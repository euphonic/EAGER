Reynolds Chefs & Culinary Arts Students
Lend Their Hearts, Their Hands, & Their Education
What does it take to fix Thanksgiving dinner for Metropolitan Richmond? Lots of giving hearts, lots of working hands, and a massive amount of planning. 
On November 22 The Giving Heart will host its 13th Annual Community Thanksgiving Feast at the Richmond Convention Center. This year, Reynolds Community College Chefs Miller, Rounds, Baird, and Highfield, and their crew of talented culinary students will lend their food preparation skills to the battalion of volunteers who make this event possible.

He says he learned a lot, but has a lot more to know.  He discovered his talent was in logistics so he came back to Reynolds again, this time to earn three workforce credentials. Learn more about Marquee and his journey in this short video.
