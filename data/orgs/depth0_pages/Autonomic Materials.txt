Leading the World in Self-Healing Technology
Our self-healing additives for high-performance coatings, adhesives, and sealants are the first of their kind to be commercially available. They save you money by preventing further deterioration to coatings damaged by common stresses— from a simple scratch on a vehicle to a severe gash on an oil rig. 
At the moment damage happens, the microcapsules release protective compounds to seal the substrate and ward off rust and deterioration, extending the service life of your equipment without human intervention. 
It’s like magic.
Longer Lasting Coatings = Less Impact on the Environment
We’ve all seen what happens when someone doesn’t quite clear our car in the parking lot— ugly scratches that are expensive to repair. But left untreated, rust is sure to follow. It’s as true with your car as it is with a wind turbine (and just imagine what the labor costs to repaint those!).
Our microcapsule technology delivers self-healing polymeric systems to actually seal themselves after damage. By creating this seal and blocking out corrosion, the finish lasts exceptionally longer, reducing the disruption (and cost!) of refinishing the surface. Further, our microcapusules can make water-based coatings last as long as solvent-based ones, which are harder on the environment and the people who handle them.
It’s win-win.
Commercial equipment is too expensive to be out of commission because of coating damage!
