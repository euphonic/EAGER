Carbon Emissions Reduction Technology with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) 
Our patented exhaust gas cleanup system has been successfully proven to remove Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Sulfur Oxides (SO2), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), and Mercury emissions from the combustion of coal and other fossil fuels for electric power generation and in other industrial processes.
Waste to Energy System- Plasma Torch and Gasification System
With the use of our patented Plasma Torch and plasma gasification system, various materials including municipal waste, coal, biomass and plastic wastes can be converted into synthesis gas (Syngas). Syngas is the clean gas fuel for electricity, synthetic fuels, and a substitute for natural gas.
