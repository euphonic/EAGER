Today, EASEL develops environmentally friendly, biosynthetic processes that transform wasted by-products into the energy and elements that make-up everyday items. We design systems that capture carbon dioxide, not for storing, but for vitally important work synthesizing fuels and chemicals—the building blocks of our daily lives. Our technology lowers emissions and improves air quality… and does so more effectively, efficiently, and cost-competitively than any other technology available, bar none. 
And we believe we can do more, still.   
About us
Technology
EASEL engineers are pioneering technologies that turn single cell organisms found in nature, into veritable factories of industry. Like a watermill sources its power from the river, EASEL generates massive amounts of energy from organic metabolic processes that thrive on renewable feedstocks.
At EASEL, the potential is limitless—and sustainable.
