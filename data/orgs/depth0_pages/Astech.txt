Specializing in Vehicle Electronics
The patented asTech
®
 remote diagnostic device is the leading tool for automotive repair shops that want to perform more efficient work and guarantee better results for customers. With the help of our staff of 
certified master technicians
, identifying all of the issues that need repair on any vehicle is easier than ever. 
The price is good for dealership-level scans. I have blown a whole lot more money on other scanners that I’ve never really even used. This tool is a whole lot cheaper and very practical financially.
