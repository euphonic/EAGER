About Alencon Systems – Passionate About Power

  At Alencon Systems, we are passionate about power. We were founded by world leading power electronics experts who wanted to apply their unique level of knowledge and experience to help alternative energy become even more cost competitive with other forms of generation.


  It is our mission to help utility-scale solar operators harness more of the sun's energy and reduce the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) produced from a PV plant. Our unique, utility scale 
DC to DC optimizers
 and 
central inverters
 allow more energy to be harvested while driving down the overall Balance of Systems (BoS) cost of a utility scale solar installation. Our products feature the remarkable 
PV-IoT
 software platform called 
VIEWS
 that allows utility scale PV operators to achieve unprecedentedly granular monitoring and virtual reality display of a PV installation to assure all aspects of the system are running at peek efficiency. When used in combination, Alencon’s DC-DC optimizers, central inverters and plant monitoring software deliver the utility-scale 
PV plant topology of tomorrow today
.
