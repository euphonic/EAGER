At AIC we create technology solutions for diverse areas of application and industry. Stemming from applied Innovation, we generate triple impact accelerating the rate of the battle against poverty. 
PLASMA WATER SANITATION SYSTEM
The Plasma Water Sanitation System (PWSS) is an innovative water treatment system that eliminates 100% of virus and bacteria through the transformation of a continuous flow of contaminated water into plasma. Through a sharp pressure drop inside the reaction chamber, the water is transformed into biphasic liquid-gas stream.
RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
RMS technology is the application of mechanical sound waves to stimulate production and recovery of hydrocarbons. With a global production of 90 million barrels of oil per day and proven reserves exceeding 1,500 billion barrels, RMS promotes quicker monetization and more resources to monetize.
