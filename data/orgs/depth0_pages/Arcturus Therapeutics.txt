LUNAR®-mediated delivery of RNA into cells
LUNAR particles associate with the cell membrane of a target cell of interest and quickly enter the cell via endocytosis.	
Upon entering the cytosol, the LUNAR formulations then become trapped in the endosomes.	
With increased acidity as the endosome ages, a pH-mediated disruption enables release of the RNA payload following rapid biodegradation of the LUNAR components.	
Once release of the RNA into the cytosol occurs, the translational machinery can interact with the RNA and processing and/or trafficking can then take place to make functional protein.	

					LUNAR® lipid mediated delivery enables delivery of RNA medicines.
