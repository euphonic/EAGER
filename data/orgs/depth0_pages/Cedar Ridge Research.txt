INNOVATIONS
We have a diverse intellectual property portfolio that includes exciting new technologies that provide solutions to significant problems and which have substantial revenue generation potential, such as:
Tailorable Truncated Retroreflector Arrays
 that retroreflect energy back to its source and also direct non-retroreflected energy to useful locations
Long distance modulating retroreflector tags
 that can be read from any angle and thrive in high-multipath metal environments
On-demand hydrogen generation
 using a high fuel efficiency, neutral pH, reactant limited chemical reaction
Free-floating graphene production
 over a magnetic field without need to remove graphene from a substrate
Long-range material spectroscopy 
that can detect, track, locate, provide power or communication with a material
Multi-card devices 
such as smartphones that store and present data cards of multiple vendors
