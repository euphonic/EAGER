Eni wins the Petroleum Economist Award 2018
Eni wins the Petroleum Economist Award 2018
For the fourth year in a row we have been named Exploration Company of the Year by
                  "Petroleum Economist", the prestigious monthly magazine that provides macroeconomic
                  and geopolitical analysis of the energy sector. This accolade confirms the quality
                  of our exploration – part of our Upstream work that CEO Claudio Descalzi defined
                  as “the focal point of our growth potential” – which is continually
                  supported by research, innovation and technology.
