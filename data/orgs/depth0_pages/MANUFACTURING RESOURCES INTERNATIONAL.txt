MFG 
is the
manufacturer’s first choice
for a
 partnership 
that goes
 beyond 
simply providing employees.
ResourceMFG has earned 
Inavero’s Best of Staffing® Talent Award
 for providing superior service to job seekers. 
Presented in partnership with CareerBuilder, Inavero’s Best of Staffing Talent winners have proven to be industry leaders in service quality based entirely on ratings provided by the permanent and temporary employees they’ve helped find jobs. On average, job seekers who work with winning agencies are 1.7 times more likely to be completely satisfied with the services provided compared to those placed by non-winning agencies. Less than 2% of all staffing agencies in the U.S. and Canada have earned the Best of Staffing Award for service excellence.
Safety Standard of Excellence
ResourceMFG is proud to announce we are among the first to achieve the Safety Standard of Excellence mark from American Staffing Association and National Safety Council. This accomplishment not only shows that we care about the safety of our temporary employees, but also that we adhere to industry best practices and are committed to continuous improvement.
Specializing in placing manufacturing workers in jobs within the manufacturing industry!
ResourceMFG places temporary and direct hire employees within the total spectrum of manufacturing jobs including production, quality, maintenance, supervision, and all levels of management.  
ResourceMFG is the manufacturer’s first choice for a partnership that goes beyond simply providing employees.
With more than 160 locations in 34 states and over 22,000 workers on assignment, ResourceMFG is the largest manufacturing specialty staffing company in the country. Unlike staffing generalists, ResourceMFG was designed and built as a manufacturing workforce specialist. We place workers in manufacturing jobs.  
It's all we do. Period.
