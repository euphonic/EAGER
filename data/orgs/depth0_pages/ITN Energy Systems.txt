Our Story
ITN was 
founded in 1995 by an elite team of scientists and engineers from a 
major aerospace corporation with a focus on developing technologies 
related to aerospace, energy, and the environment for defense and 
commercial marketplaces. With government and industry funding, ITN has 
invested over $200 Million in research and development since inception.
ITN R&D programs have resulted in numerous technical and business successes, including five commercial spinoff companies.
