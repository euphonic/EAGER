Optics Balzers
The key factors to success on the development of a biosensor for water analysis were our close relationship with CSEM as a powerful research partner and a strong conviction with regards to the center's practicality in the market. 
Optics Balzers, the manufacturer of optically coated components and assemblies, is collaborating with CSEM on the development of a biosensor for water analysis. The sensor is also intended to be used later to measure hormone residues in sea water. The factors that were instrumental in the Liechtenstein-based company launching the project were its close relationship with CSEM as a powerful research partner and a strong conviction with regards to the center's practicality in the market. The declared long-term goal is to develop a complete biochip that will be produced in large quantities in Optics Balzers' clean rooms.

The spirit of collaboration that CSEM has shown has been excellent and I would specifically like to commend the center. 
I would like to thank CSEM for the support it provided for the Rio Tinto campaign. The spirit of collaboration that CSEM has shown has been excellent and I would specifically like to commend the center for the preparation of the pre-testing as well as for the actual testing in Rio Tinto [...] not to mention the very good data we have recorded using LTMS. All in all a very good analogue simulation, which should be the basis of future activities.

Adolphe Merkle Institute
In CSEM, we found a professional partner that engineered an ultra-thin insert for cell culture. This fruitful collaboration has led to the development of a new quadruple in vitro model of the human air–blood tissue barrier.
At AMI, our expertise is in the development of realistic cell co-culture models of the lung for the risk assessment of newly engineered nanomaterials. Until recently, the bottleneck had been the use of conventional insert membranes, which are ten times thicker than the air–blood barrier itself. In CSEM, we found a professional partner that engineered an ultra-thin insert for cell culture. This fruitful collaboration, funded by Lunge Zürich, has led to the development of a new quadruple in vitro model of the human air–blood tissue barrier.
