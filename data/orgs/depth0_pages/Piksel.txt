What we do…
Get closer to your viewers
We help you get to the heart of your viewers’ interests and preferences. Because understanding how, where and why they consume content is key to creating higher value and engagement. Together, with our open modular platform, Piksel can help you deliver the right content, at a lower cost of entry, right from the start.
Unleash valuable content
Look beyond traditional distribution and find new opportunities to make your video content constantly and readily available. With consistent, broadcast-level support, our cloud platform allows you to unleash and monetize all of your content by opening new channels where more viewers can have high-quality video experiences.
Deliver infinite content at a predictable cost
Distribute your content efficiently and cost-effectively through the channels you choose, without having to invest in specialized technology resources or costly hardware platforms. When you partner with Piksel, we provide solutions to help expand your reach, so you can focus on increasing viewer satisfaction while still controlling cost.

Our products
Effectively delivering the best customer experiences is difficult when metadata is siloed across an organisation and difficult to manage. Fuse Metadata Manager enables you to manage complex editorial workflows and consolidate their metadata into a single, coherent, low latency dataset, creating a highly accurate, consolidated view through a single tool across content processing, ingest, catalogue management, presentation and publishing workflows. This gives the ability to manage the complete metadata lifecycle, leading to a more organised back office, improved ability to match and aggregate content and an enhanced quality of experience. Fuse Metadata Manager is currently being deployed by some of the largest broadcasters and pay-TV providers in the world.

Media supply chains have traditionally been built with the focus being on servicing linear content, with digital workflows added after the fact. These dual linear and digital chains create duplication, slow agility and increase OPEX. Fuse Publisher gives broadcasters and content owners the ability to bring these siloed workflows together, delivering a unified, digital first supply chain, lowering latency, duplication, operational costs and TCO, while increasing agility, productivity, speed to market and revenue. This shared infrastructure enables the ability to automatically syndicate content to a defined set of end points and distributors, maximising C3/C7 ad value and delivering content when, where and how end users want it.

From increased time and cost to market, through to the complexity of legacy supply chains and the ability to keep up with emerging devices, experiences and trends, modernising an OTT service is full of challenges. Digital Showcase can smooth this potentially difficult transition by delivering the feature focused functionality you need. Designed to operate in concert with legacy systems, the flexible architecture enables you to use as much or as little as you want – from a single feature to full suite solution, speeding time to market and creating a strong, flexible foundation for future enhancements.

Legacy architectures have stripped broadcast and media businesses of their ability to respond rapidly to change in order to meet their business needs. The Piksel Palette is a cloud-native microservices architecture that delivers feature focused, functional modules that enable rapid, incremental steps towards the long-term goal of taking full advantage of cloud migration, replacing and improving functionality at the speed that suits the business. This means a lower total cost of ownership, a reduction of vendor lock-in, greater operational flexibility and resilience and a faster time to innovate. Modules are designed to work with legacy systems at all levels, so you can deliver new, more responsive functionality without disrupting your existing workflow.
