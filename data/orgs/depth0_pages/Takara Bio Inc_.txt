A new method for SMARTer library preparation from challenging RNA samples
                                        
In this webinar, Dr. Nathalie Bolduc (Takara Bio USA, Inc.) presents data from the SMARTer Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v2 - Pico Input Mammalian, which generates Illumina-ready sequencing libraries from 250 pg–10 ng mammalian total RNA inputs of any quality, including FFPE samples.
Video protocol: editing human iPSCs with CRISPR/Cas9 and single-cell cloning
                                        
Our start-to-finish editing and single-cell cloning kits make human iPS cell editing routine instead of frustrating. In this video protocol, we provide step-by-step instructions for generating edited human iPS cell lines using our complete system for electroporation-based delivery of RNP complexes and single-cell cloning. This high-efficiency workflow greatly improves single-cell survival post-seeding, thanks to the Cellartis DEF-CS culture system. In addition to our electroporation-based kit, we also offer an alternate kit that uses gesicles to deliver RNP complexes.

Capturem Trypsin provides rapid, efficient, and complete digestion of protein samples, allowing an 
uninterrupted mass spectometry workflow
 at room temperature for downstream protein analysis. This product utilizes our novel Capturem technology in a spin column format with membrane-immobilized trypsin. Capturem Trypsin Columns may be used to completely digest protein samples in less than a minute with digestion efficiencies (protein coverage) comparable to or better than those obtained using in-solution trypsin digestion.
