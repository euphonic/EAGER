We are on a mission to change the way in which healthcare is provided by giving researchers the ability to closely examine the continuum from health to disease. Click on one of the therapeutic category icons below to learn how our revolutionary technology is helping researchers advance the science of precision health.
Oncology
​​​​​​
The ability to detect oncology biomarkers at ultra-low levels is enabling new options for diagnostics and treatment in cancer research. Simoa assays can be used to monitor cancer risk, identify early stage cancers and discriminate between benign and malignant cells. Simoa biomarkers can be used prognostically to predict disease outcome, predict progression free survival and monitor reoccurrence. Assays can also be used to monitor sensitivity to therapy and to aid in treatment decisions.
Neurology
The ability to detect neurological biomarkers at ultra-low levels, which have traditionally only been detectable in cerebrospinal fluid, will transform the way brain injuries and diseases are diagnosed. Simoa assays can detect biomarkers associated with brain injury and disease at much earlier stages to understand the long-term effects and disease pathology. Quanterix has a strategic focus in neurology and neurodegeneration and is working with a rapidly growing network of academic researchers and pharmaceutical and biotech partners to drive advancements in head health research.
Cardiology
The ability to detect cardiac biomarkers at ultra-low levels is advancing the future of heart health. Simoa assays can detect cardiac biomarkers, which are instrumental for predicting major adverse cardiovascular events, development of heart failure or transition to end-stage kidney disease, earlier than ever before. Further, the ability to detect minute changes in these biomarkers enables the identification of at-risk patients earlier in their disease progression to guide more personalized, preventive care. 
Immunology
Simoa assays can measure inflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules in serum and plasma with unprecedented sensitivity enabling new discoveries into the role of inflammation in the biology of health and disease.  The ability to measure the cascade of events leading to inflammation at the earliest stage of disease progression or treatment response will enable researchers to make new insights into prevention and treatment of inflammation in multiple therapeutic areas.
Infectious Disease
The ability to detect infectious disease biomarkers before the onset of an immune response, while a virus is most contagious and multiplying rapidly, is critical for controlling the spread of disease. Infectious disease is one of the hottest areas of research today and researchers continue to seek ways to detect and diagnose infections earlier and more accurately. Simoa assays can have a significant impact in reducing the spread of the disease by making early stage detection more widely available.

        A Message From Kevin Hrusovsky
            

        President, CEO & Chairman of Quanterix
            
We're passionate about the work we do and believe we can transform today’s sick care into tomorrow’s precision healthcare. The future of healthy living is being realized by uncovering novel biomarkers with the power to transform medicine, allowing for prevention, early diagnosis and nextgen treatments.

According to the Centers for Disease Control, up to four million concussions occur each year. A big challenge is trying to figure out whether someone has actually had one or not. Lexington-based Quanterix may have a solution.
“It’s like rocket science on the blood,” says Quanterix CEO and Executive Chairman, Kevin Hrusovsky.
