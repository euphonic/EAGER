What is the SunSaluter?
The SunSaluter is a solar panel rotator designed for the developing world. Using only the power of gravity and water, the SunSaluter enables a solar panel to follow the sun throughout the day, boosting efficiency by 30% and producing four liters of clean drinking water. It is 30 times less expensive than conventional motorized solar panel rotators, much more reliable, and consumes no electricity itself.
Build Your Own SunSaluter
SunSaluter Around the World
SunSaluters have been deployed all around the world, boosting solar panel output by 30%, so fewer solar panels are needed and overall system costs are reduced by 10-20%. By lowering the cost of solar energy, the SunSaluter help impoverished families eliminate the use of kerosene gas, work and study longer hours, and charge cell phones. Furthermore, the SunSaluter enables solar panels to produce energy more consistently through the day, beginning earlier in the morning and lasting later at night. This is critical for rural families who often wake at sunrise, and helps reduce the need for batteries to store energy that is normally produced mostly around high noon.
