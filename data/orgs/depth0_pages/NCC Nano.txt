Technology
Photonic Curing
Photonic Curing is the high-temperature thermal processing of a thin film using pulsed light from a flashlamp. When this transient processing is done on a low-temperature substrate such as plastic, paper or glass it is possible to attain a significantly higher temperature than the substrate can ordinarily withstand under an equilibrium heating source such as an oven.

PULSEFORGE TOOLS FOR PRINTED ELECTRONICS
The PulseForge family of tools can heat conductive inks and thin films in milliseconds without over heating underlying or adjacent substrates. The tools are used to dry, sinter, or anneal thin-film materials on substrate materials such as polymers, paper and glass. The tools also drive UV processes, and initiate and modulate reactions in materials such as the Metalon ICI-series of copper-oxide reduction inks. These tools are intended for product innovators and manufacturers in printed electronics and other industries who need options to traditional use of materials and processing tools such as ovens or lasers. The use of PulseForge tools can save time and money, and enable new types of products in applications like displays, RFID, smart packaging, batteries, capacitors, solar and flexible circuits.
