We are reengineering the Huckabay Ridge Biogas Facility with the latest advancements in anaerobic digestion and recycling technologies to produce steady supplies of pipeline-quality renewable gas in this central Texas community...
REOPENING NORTH AMERICA'S LARGEST BIOGAS PLANT
Leading the expansion of biogas infrastructure in the U.S.
Verliant Energy is targeting one of the world's largest sources of carbon pollution, organic waste. We are developing biogas projects that manage industrial food wastes and manure from livestock operations, and transform these into renewable gas resources and nutrient-rich fertilizers. By better recycling organic wastes and capturing carbon emissions for reuse as clean energy, we are helping communities create a greener future for America.
Renewable gas produced by anaerobic digestion provides clean energy and meaningful carbon reductions for our  communities and customers.
We process a wide range of fats, oils & greases (FOGs), sludge and other food wastes from food manufacturers and grease haulers.
Biogas facilities mitigate carbon pollution from manure, and offer dairies a more cost-effective solution for manure management.
