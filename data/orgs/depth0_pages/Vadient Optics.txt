Creating a New Class of Optical Design
Vadient Optics was formed to fabricate freeform gradient index nanocomposite optical elements. Our optical engineers are transforming the long-unchanged field of lens fabrication. Vadientâ€™s Volumetric Index of Refraction Gradient Optics (VIRGO) lens technology reduces size, weight, and power requirements of high-performance electro-optical systems, like efficient solar concentrators, night vision imagers, and professional high-definition televisions (HDTV).
