Creating New Enabling Materials for Analysis, Diagnosis, and Therapy 
Nanoquantum is a photonic materials solutions company actively engaged in the development of   new photo-chemical compounds and related photonic technologies.
Our business  is developing, manufacturing, and selling novel  photoluminescent labels, photosensitizers, and related technologies. We also license the use of  our enabling materials and technologies to organizations that will create and qualify new analytical methods, diagnostics,  and therapeutics using our products and technologies. 
Our new non-toxic dye compounds provide high stability and higher efficiency   near-infrared photoluminescent brightness (extinction * quantum   yield) than any other small-molecule biological labels currently in the market. 
Several of   our high-brightness near-IR photoluminescent materials can also provide   additional functionality as high X-ray contrast agents and as photoacoustic   imaging reporters 
We are undertaking these efforts with the goal of opening new doors   with customers and licensees to create new analytical capabilities, as well as   diagnostic and therapeutic solutions for many cancers, antibiotic resistant   pathogens, as visualization aids in surgery or radiation therapy, and for other applications our core   technology can address.
