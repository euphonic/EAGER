Your Life as a Phoenix
What does it mean to be a Phoenix? We are the risers. The ones who know that if we want it, we have to go out and get it. We give blood, sweat, and sometimes tears. We are sculpted by adversity. We are made from desire and a dream, but we leave nothing up to fate. We have the skill, and we have the will. And we will not let ourselves be ignored.

What resources are available to help me develop a financial plan to pay for my education?
Once you’ve chosen your degree program and decided whether you will attend online or at a local campus, you can determine how much you’ll invest in your education and how you will pay for it.

With the financial planning tool you can:
Determine your estimated tuition and expenses based on your degree program and location.
Enter your financial information to explore ways to pay for your tuition and expenses.
Review your financial plan to see if you need to make adjustments.
Having information about your taxes, savings and any prior college credits available will help with this process. The more specific the information you provide, the more accurate your estimate will be.
