Precision Positioning and Orientation Technology

    PRA is developing technologies for the generation of coded fields that enable compatible
    receivers to determine their own location and orientation and that of their targets.
    This technology is being developed for guiding smart munitions, significantly reducing the
    cost of achieving intercept for low-cost proliferated threats.  In addition, this technology
    is being used to track participants in immersive training simulators.
    
Adaptive Interference Cancellation

    PRA is developing an innovative approach to adaptively cancel strong interference. This unique process can be used to mitigate various interference sources including noise jamming, RF interference, and discrete and distributed clutter.
