OUR MISSION
At MBI, we strive to create meaningful societal benefits by collaborating with universities, governments, financial supporters, and companies to accelerate the commercialization of biobased technologies. Consistent with our not-for-profit mission, we share select technologies—those that show the promise of game-changing sustainability—with the global community.

BIOBASED BREAKTHROUGHS
AFEX is an agricultural innovation that sustainably expands our capacity to supply both food and fuel while reducing our carbon footprint and providing pathways out of poverty.
Together with MSU and Cargill, MBI developed PLA, the polymer used worldwide to make renewable and biodegradable containers and cutlery.

DNA OF BIOTECH DERISKING
MBI helps organizations quickly and cost-effectively weed out flawed technologies and accelerate viable ones to commercialization. We apply a unique biotech derisking process—which we pioneered—to the development of biofuels, chemicals, food, and feed from renewable, rather than fossil, raw materials. MBI combines a full spectrum of science, engineering, operational, and business expertise with an integrated and flexible infrastructure, taking your technology from the lab to bench and pilot scales.

ACCELERATING TECHNOLOGIES
EXPERTISE 
		
We work with a variety of organisms (bacteria, yeast, fungi, and algae)—in aerobic, anaerobic, micro-aerobic, and highly aerobic environments. Our team is steeped in commercialization and biobased industry experience. Our track record? In the past 5 years alone we have scaled-up 19 different technologies from bench-scale to pilot-scale with a 100% success rate. 
		
MBI'S WORKFLOW 
		
MBI is a test kitchen for game-changing technologies, with a range of equipment you need. We collaborate with you, refining your recipe and process. From there, we help you scale up your capacity, from a few dishes to serving the crowds.

In tech speak: We guide our clients through a milestone-based, stage-gated innovation process—starting with the technology transfer and process development, all the way through scale-up, purification, and recovery. Thanks to our unique derisking process, we can go directly from a 5L fermenter to a 3800L fermenter. This scale-up philosophy saves our clients valuable time and money. 
		
BENCH-SCALE & PROCESS DEVELOPMENT  
		
Just because you can perform a process at bench-scale, doesn’t necessarily mean it can be brought to commercial scale. For instance, media that seem inexpensive at bench-scale can become deeply cost-prohibitive when brought to the next stage of development. Moreover, optimal equipment settings at bench-scale are sometimes unmatchable at a larger scale. 

At MBI, our team utilizes this phase to provide early, clear insights into your technology’s promise, answering the most important question: Is your technology and its processes economically feasible and scalable?
 
		
PILOT PLANT & SCALE-UP 
		
At MBI, we know that scaling up any novel biobased technology can present unique challenges—even for the most experienced professionals. That’s where we can help. MBI’s flexible pilot scale facility and experienced staff are dedicated to the rapid and efficient scale-up of your technologies.
Our clients depend on us to help them progress from the lab to pilot-scale, and our derisking process provides the degree of confidence required to take your technology to commercial scale.
We can generate quantities of product for application testing and validation, depending on your needs. Moreover, our team provides you with a complete data package, showing you precisely how your technology works at scale.
PURIFICATION & RECOVERY 
		
If you cannot separate end products from the chemicals used—or produced—during biobased processing, then ultimately the technology cannot be scaled or commercialized. We can help you.

MBI has both lab and pilot scale capabilities and expertise to develop and carry out separation, purification, conversion, and recovery. Our team is committed to collaborating with you to either develop new product separation/purification processes or to develop and scale existing processes. What’s more, we offer the equipment and staffing you need to separate and purify large quantities of biobased chemicals, for both application and testing.
