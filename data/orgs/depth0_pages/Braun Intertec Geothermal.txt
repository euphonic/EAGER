Construction Materials Testing
U.S. Bank Stadium
Completed in 2016, U.S. Bank Stadium gives Minnesotans a state-of-the-art multi-purpose facility for sporting events, concerts, family programs, and community events. To give fans a comfortable “outdoor” experience during the snowy winter months, a 240,000 square-foot translucent roof designed to endure heavy snow loads was installed. It was crucial that the roof's truss and supporting steel frame were installed to design and tested for structural integrity. That’s where Braun Intertec came into play.
