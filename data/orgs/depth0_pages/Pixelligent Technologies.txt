The application of nanotechnology in advanced materials will impact almost every product we touch everyday.
Zirconia Based High RI Materials

                    Our high refractive index nanocrystal dispersions dramatically improve optical and mechanical properties to enable next-generation products. We disperse nanocrystals into a variety of solvents and polymer systems to create perfectly clear dispersions.
