1/20th, 100X, 1000x
A radical departure from traditional memory.
Because of its simple structure, ReRAM can scale to smaller than 10nm, stack in 3D, and be directly integrated with logic in the same foundry. With ReRAM you get 1/20th the energy; 1000x endurance; 100x read performance; 1000x write performance and terabytes of storage on-chip.
The possibilities are endless for a new way of thinking about storage and computing.
