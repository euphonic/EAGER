Imaging-based molecular barcoding with pixelated dielectric metasurfaces
Science | June 8, 2018 | DOI: 10.1126/science.aas9768 | H. Altug, et al
Researchers at EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland) recently developed a novel nanophotonic sensor array which could someday be used in routine environmental sensing and point-of-care diagnostics. The new image-based sensor leverages wide-field QCL imaging and functionalized nanofabricated metasurfaces to perform massively parallel sensing of protein and polymer mixture monolayers.
