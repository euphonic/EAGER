Radical Collaboration
Multidisciplinary Partnerships
The challenges of the world and the big picture of what’s possible rarely fit neatly into a single academic discipline. This is why we’ve made collaboration and communication a way of life at Cornell. We foster a community of renowned scholars that spans disciplines, locations, and industries in order to convert promising ideas and innovations into results that truly matter.
