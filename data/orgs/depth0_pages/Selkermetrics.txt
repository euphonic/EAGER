SelkerMetrics, LLC.
 helps clients and regulators understand water movement in the environment. We use fiber optic
distributed temperature sensing (DTS) and other technologies to locate seeps emerging into water bodies.  We also deploy 
sensors in wells to understand fluid movements.  

SelkerMetrics 
uses proprietary patented hardware and software to investigate large areas over extended periods of time.  This offers
both confidence that water movement is accurately measured and information about temporal influences such as tides, pumping, and other changes.
