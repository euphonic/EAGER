We are inaeris technologies
We are Inaeris Technologies – a cutting-edge biofuel technology company advancing the development of a proprietary technology platform that transforms non-food biomass into drop-in hydrocarbon transportation fuel blendstocks.  Our technology platform can provide new, alternative sources of hydrocarbon transportation fuels – sustainably – using a variety of renewable feedstocks to help promote energy security and combat global warming through reduced lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions.  Our technology is flexible and can be commercialized either as a stand-alone facility or as an addition to an existing facility, such as one that already processes biomass (a pulp/paper mill) or produces fuels (a petroleum refinery). 
​Nearly one million gallons of cellulosic gasoline and diesel blendstocks have been produced using our technology and distributed seamlessly through the existing fuel infrastructure in the United States to power today’s cars and trucks.
