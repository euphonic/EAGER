Waterloo
Emitters
The Waterloo Emitter is a simple, low cost device designed for the bioremediation of contaminated groundwater. Sized to fit 2", 4" and 6" wells and boreholes, can be installed in stacks vertically or horizontally to ensure full coverage of the contaminant plume. The controlled release of oxygen and various other amendments encourage and sustain the growth of microorganisms required for bioremediation.

ERD
Electron
Donors
Enhanced reductive dechlorination (ERD) requires adding sufficient organic substrate (electron donor, such as 
EDS-ER™
, and nutrients, such as 
Nutrimens®
) to satisfy electron acceptor demand from both inorganic and organic compounds (i.e. chlorinated solvents) in the treatment zone.
