At Tesla, we constantly question the status quo and think about how we could be doing things better. That’s why we’re making solar-powered cars and that’s why we grill on SolSource. Harnessing the power of the sun allows us to eat healthy food cooked with clean energy. Solar cars and solar kitchens – that’s a great place to start our energy revolution

Ever needed to heat a large quantity of water? Praxis Prepper used SolSource to heat 4 gallons of rain water from 70°F to 130°F in two hours. The water was more than hot enough for a bath or other domestic use.
