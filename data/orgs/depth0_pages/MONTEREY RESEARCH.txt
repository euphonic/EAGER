Large underwater experiment shows that “turbidity currents” involve movement of the seafloor
October 5, 2018
October 5, 2018 –  A new paper shows that currents in submarine canyons often involve large-scale movement of the seafloor. This discovery could help ocean engineers avoid damage to pipelines, communications cables, and other seafloor structures.

The RV Paragon may be the smallest vessel in our fleet, but it is an integral part of MBARI’s day-to-day operations. Leased from University of California, Santa Cruz’s Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) program, the Paragon is well equipped to deploy long-range AUVs, wave gliders, small moorings, instruments, and conduct diving operations in near coastal waters. It is out on the bay almost daily and serves as a fast and inexpensive alternative to our larger vessels. If you’re out on the bay and spot her, wave “hi” and keep an eye out because you never know what new and exciting instrument may be in the nearby waters.

About MBARI
Research programs at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) encompass the entire ocean, from the surface waters to the deep seafloor, and from the coastal zone to the open sea. The need to understand the ocean in all its complexity and variability drives MBARI's research and development efforts.
