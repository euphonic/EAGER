Optoelectronic Components
Our optoelectronic components enable a broad range of applications including in high power lasers for materials processing, optical amplifiers for terrestrial and submarine communications, high bit rate transceivers for datacenters, analytical instruments for life sciences, LiDAR for automotive and 3D sensing for consumer electronics.
Optical Systems
We leverage the unique properties of our engineered materials to produce differentiated optics shaped by precision surfacing techniques and assembled into miniature- to large-scale precision optical systems with thermal management. Our optical coatings provide the desired spectral characteristics and enhance durability to high energy lasers and harsh environments. We leverage these capabilities to deliver optical systems integrated with electronics and software.
Engineered Materials
Our engineered materials enable a broad range of existing and emerging applications in materials processing, communications, military, semiconductor equipment, life sciences, automotive and consumer electronics.
We refine rare metals. We grow and fabricate a broad portfolio of crystals, ceramics and metal matrix composites that are differentiated by one or a combination of unique optical, electrical, magnetic, thermal and mechanical properties.
Our compound semiconductor materials include SiC substrates, as well as InP- and GaAs-based epitaxial wafers. These products enable RF, power and optoelectronic devices such as for 5G wireless, electric vehicles and datacenter transceivers.

II-VI Incorporated Introduces Breakthrough Scandium Recovery Technology
		
				November 26, 2018				
II‐VI Incorporated (Nasdaq:IIVI), a leader in engineered materials, today announced the introduction and availability for licensing of its breakthrough scandium recovery technology. Scandium is a rare earth element increasingly demanded for applications that reduce carbon emissions, improve air quality and strengthen energy security. In one particular application of growing interest, scandium enables low-emission solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) that operate off the electric grid. Scandium also enables ultra-high strength and lightweight aluminum alloys that improve fuel efficiency in transportation vehicles,...
