Thermal Management in a PCB!
STABLCOR TECHNOLOGY, INC. is an Intellectual Property Company solving thermal and mechanical problems in Printed Circuit Boards and IC Substrates. Our patented STABLCOR速 product, (a carbon composite laminate), when embedded into a PCB allows electronics to pass beyond the thermo-mechanical limitations of today's current materials and technologies.
STABLCOR速 represents a major technological leap forward in PCB technology. In development for over 10 years, STABLCOR PCB's have proven superior in some of the most severe environments. 
STABLCOR速 began as a NASA invested project and has been successfully tested and used in the space and defense industries by prime contractors including Boeing, Raytheon, and General Dynamics.
