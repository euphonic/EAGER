VAX014 PRODUCT
​​​​​​​
Vaxiion Therapeutics is a biopharmaceutical company developing a proprietary biopharmaceutical drug delivery system based on its targeted bacterial minicell (
BMC
) technology for use in cancer.  BMCs are small, chromosomeless (i.e., non-living and non-infectious), spherical bacterial particles engineered to encapsulate, target, and deliver a wide array of therapeutically relevant molecules (including protein toxins, small molecule drugs, RNAi, plasmids, peptides, and imaging agents) directly to cancer cells. 
​Vaxiion's primary focus is on the development of its lead product candidate, 
VAX014​ for Instillation
,
 a minicell-based biopharmaceutical designed and formulated for initial use in the treatment of Non-muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (
NMIBC
).  
VAX014
 works by specifically targeting and delivering a novel fast-acting protein toxin directly to bladder cancer cells.  
​Armed with compelling pre-clinical efficacy data and scalable manufacturing processes, 
VAX014
 is well positioned for clinical and commercial development in an underserved disease space for which no new market approval has been announced in nearly 20 years.
