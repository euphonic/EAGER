Superluminescent Diodes
Inphenix’s Superluminescent Diodes combine very broad spectral bandwidths with high output power to deliver speckle-free emission wavelengths from 700nm to 1700nm. Superluminescent diode (SLD) is an edge-emitting semiconductor light source. The unique property of an SLD is its high output power and low beam divergence, similar to an injection laser diode (LD), but with a broad emission spectrum and low coherence, similar to a light emitting diode (LED). SLDs are similar in geometry to lasers but have no built-in optical feedback mechanism required by LDs for stimulated emission to achieve lasing.
