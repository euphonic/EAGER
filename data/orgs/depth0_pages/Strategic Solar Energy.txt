Lot 59 at Arizona State University
A sun-baked surface parking lot for students during the week and a key location for tailgating prior to sporting events, PowerParasol changed Lot 59 from a last resort to a premium place to park. 
“PowerParasol has provided us with outside-engineered space, that’s fantastically conducive to the kind of engagement that we want all throughout the year and, oh, by the way are electric power plants.“
 – Michael Crow, President, Arizona State University

“The customers love it, I mean the availability of shade – that’s something that they can experience right away.”
 – Dennis Barr, Manager of Real Estate, Fry’s Food Store
