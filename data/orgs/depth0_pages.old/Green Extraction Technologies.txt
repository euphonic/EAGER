At Green Extraction Technologies, LLC, our mission is to bring a professional and scientific approach to tree treatment and service by offering a thorough understanding of their health from the root system to the crown. We not only offer expert tree care and service, but also strive to educate the public on how we can promote the future health and well-being of trees to protect and preserve the Urban Forest. Before performing any tree removals, we'll take the time to educate our clients on health concerns facing their trees and possible alternatives for keeping their trees alive and well.
