We Call It Norman Because He Deserves it
TAE Technologies latest generator is named after our late intellectual co-founder, Dr. Norman Rostoker.
He envisioned the path to clean, commercial fusion energy nearly two decades ago. Today’s working machine is nearly identical to his original model.
Since unveiling Norman in July 2017, we have performed over 3,000 experiments with the machine.
Our current work with Norman is focused on plasma merging and field-reverse configurations (FRCs) to achieve optimal, scalable conditions for fusion.
