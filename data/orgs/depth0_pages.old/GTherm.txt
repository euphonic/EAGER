Exotex, Inc. is the developer of proprietary high-temperature tolerant and/or corrosion resistant advanced composite materials that outperform conventional materials (carbon fiber, broadly termed “fiber reinforced composites “FRCs”). Exotex epoxies when used to saturate woven or spun materials and products (including pipes) will perform in “high temperature” and/or caustic environments, with “high tensile strength”, impact-resistant, moisture absorption resistance.
GTherm GEO, Inc. is the developer of the Single-Well Engineered Geothermal System™ (“SWEGS”) for the generation of baseload geothermal power. GTherm GEO SWEGS is a closed system that does not require building a water reservoir and emit zero 6HG.
