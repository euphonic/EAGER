Water Conversation has become a necessity: 
As usage restrictions on our most important natural resource become tighter, conservation is even more important.  Water rates continue to climb as projected and synthetic turf is providing a solution to this growing issue.   The majority of a household’s water usage is used on landscape.  In most communities where water is in short supply and there are restrictions on watering real grass, synthetic turf provides a low maintenance lawn that looks green and healthy year round.
