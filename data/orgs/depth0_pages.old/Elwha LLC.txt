 – The Strong People
The Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe is a sovereign, federally recognized Indian Nation, with its own constitution and 
government
. Not only does the Tribe govern itself, but many Tribal administrative 
departments
 oversee the everyday function of the reservation and provide for Tribal members.
The Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe resides in the Lower Elwha River Valley and adjacent bluffs on the north coast of the Olympic Peninsula just west of Port Angeles, Washington. As recognized by the United States in 1855’s 
Treaty of Point No Point
, the Tribe has lived in this area since 
time immemorial
.
The Tribe’s current landbase was initially acquired by the United States in trust for the Tribe in 1935-36 and these lands were proclaimed as the Lower Elwha Reservation in 1968. Today tribal lands include about 1,000 acres on and near the 
Elwha River
.
​Vision​
To ensure that the Lower Elwha Klallam people can pass on their way of life to their children.
Mission
To build a strong and healthy sovereign nation where Tribal members live their 
values
 and 
culture
.
This means enhancing the lives of our people both physically and spiritually through social well being and economic independence while preserving and enhancing our natural resources and cultural heritage.
