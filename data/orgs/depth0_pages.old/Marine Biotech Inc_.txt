Welcome to ERA-MarineBiotech
Funded under the FP7 ERA-NET scheme, 
ERA-MarineBiotech
 is a consortium of 
national funding bodies
 seeking complementarities between national activities to pool resources to undertake joint funding of transnational projects in the area of Marine Biotechnology.

Cooperation between the funding bodies has been initiated during the FP7 supported ERA-NET Preparatory Action in Marine Biotechnology

(
CSA MarineBiotech
).
This website pools information on both FP7 projects and offers simultaneously a forum for the exchange of information between a broad network of academics, industry researchers and specialists with interests in marine biotechnology.

Ultimately this should raise the profile of European marine biotechnology research and lead to a self-sustainable and long lasting network in the area of marine biotechnology.
