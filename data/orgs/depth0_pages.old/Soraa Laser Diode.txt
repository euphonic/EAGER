Who We Are
SLD is commercializing a new generation of visible laser sources for display, automotive, and specialty applications. SLD's visible LaserLight sources are used directly in single color and R-G-B applications, or integrated into laser pumped phosphor architectures. These sources enable applications in a myriad of vertical markets, including:  general lighting, automotive headlights, projection displays, defense pointers & illuminators, biomedical instrumentation & therapeutics, and industrial material processing & imaging applications.  As an independent spin-off from Soraa Inc. (LED lighting), SLD was founded by several leading global pioneers in solid-state lighting, including Dr. Shuji Nakamura, 2014 Nobel Laureate in Physics, Dr. Steve Denbaars, Dr. James Raring, and Dr. Paul Rudy.  SLD operates fabrication facilities in California's Silicon Valley and Santa Barbara, CA.
