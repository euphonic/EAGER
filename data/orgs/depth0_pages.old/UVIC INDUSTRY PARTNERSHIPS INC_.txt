Partner on research
School children participate in the final planting of a new rainwater system and rain garden at the Oak and Orca Bioregional School. This project was made possible thanks to a partnership between UVic and the community to help teach students about the importance of rainwater management. 
As part of a unique collaboration between the University of Victoria, the Victoria Genealogical Society and the Victoria Police Historical Society, these 19th century police charge books were digitized to be preserved for future generations
