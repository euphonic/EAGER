Our 
AI Surveillance
 (AIS) platform can spot weapons, people concealing their identity, fire, and intruders after-hours, all at a fraction of the cost of a human-only monitoring solution.
Any detected threatening event is handled by one of our monitoring analysts, who immediately contacts your local authorities when the situation calls for it.

 Our family-owned spirits store isn't in the best area. Having a service that can spot threats in real-time is reassuring.

A New Deterrent
It's well known that surveillance systems are a deterrent against crime, but they don't stop it completely. 
Criminals will think twice knowing your business has a service that can spot them immediately.
Having a sign on our door that says the store is actively monitored discourages trouble.

Immediate Response
You want the fastest response when it matters most.
Our analysts will be in touch with you and your local authorites immediately when a threatening situation is detected.
I find the mobile alerts useful when I'm on the go. If someone is in my business after-hours I know about it immediately.
