Newlans has developed the highest Q (Quality Factor) Programmable SOI (Silicon-on-Insulator) capacitor and components for integration into Tunable RFFE (Radio Frequency Front End) solutions. The proliferation of worldwide 4G LTE Bands and the increased deployment of Carrier Aggregation (CA) is forcing Smartphone OEM’s and RFFE Module suppliers to adopt Tunable solutions as a way to break the rigidity of today’s Smartphone RF front-ends while reducing cost, size and optimizing performance.
