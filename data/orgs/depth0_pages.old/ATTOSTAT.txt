Nanotechnology, the manipulation of matter at the atomic and molecular scale, is fundamentally changing our approach to critical problems. Unfortunately, the potential for nanotechnology has been limited by the inability to produce safe nano material in useful quantities--until now. Attostat Inc. has developed a way to produce effective, safe, and scalable nano solutions to help address a broad array of issues, with an emphasis on the anti-microbial and anti-viral applications of nanotechnology. Attostat is currently pursuing partnerships that can make the benefits of this revolutionary technology available to the world.
NANOTECHNOLOGY TODAY
What is Nanotechnology? 
Nanotechnology is the understanding and control of matter at the nanoscale, at dimensions between approximately 1 and 100 nanometers, where unique phenomena enable novel applications. Encompassing nanoscale science, engineering, and technology, nanotechnology involves imaging, measuring, modeling, and manipulating matter at this length scale.
Matter such as gases, liquids, and solids can exhibit unusual physical, chemical, and biological properties at the nanoscale.
 Consequently nanotechnology does not represent just the next step in miniaturization; it represents new possibilities for solving some of the world's most difficult challenges.  Nanotechnology offers new ways to resolve issues on global scale as well as local; to build safer oil pipelines, engineer more effective drugs, and boost the global food supply.
Nanotechnology Challenges 
Nanoparticle science and manufacturing generally face challenges in three areas.
Efficacy: 
Most nanoparticles are not solid metal, can't be manufactured to specific sizes and fall out of solution quickly. This means that for their limited applications, they are less powerful and have a short shelf life.
Toxicity: 
 Most nanoparticles are ionic and use chemical surfactants - both can be toxic to humans and the environment.
Scalability: 
Effective, stable nanoparticles are prohibitively expensive to produce and cannot be manufactured to scale - inhibiting broad market adoption and limiting potential applications.
INDUSTRY APPLICATIONS
