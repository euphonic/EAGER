Taking the Guesswork out of Medicine
Targeted Solutions for Serious Diseases
VBS Pharmaceuticals
Our lead therapeutic candidate, CARSKNKDC (CAR) peptide, represents a new paradigm in targeted therapy. CAR preferentially homes to, and penetrates diseased tissue while selectively augmenting the efficacy of therapies. CAR can selectively boost drug effectiveness and reduce systemic side effects by enhancing the targeted uptake of co-administered therapeutics in preclinical models of pulmonary hypertension and  triple-negative breast cancer. Additionally, CAR has shown promise in accelerating wound healing, enhancing gene therapy, ameliorating cachexia and in improving sepsis survival.

VBS Interventional
Our first interventional product, the endoarterial biopsy catheter, is the world’s first interventional device to obtain a biopsy sample from the inner layers of an artery in a minimally invasive fashion. Endoarterial biopsies will better enable the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of vascular-based diseases, and provide the synergy to develop a wide range of products, services, and pharmaceuticals that target vascular-based diseases.

VBS Molecular Diagnostics

Our molecular diagnostic products and services will provide molecular analysis of endoarterial biopsy samples and provide a comprehensive profile of a patient’s vascular disease. Performing transcriptional profiling of biopsies has long been a hallmark of modern cancer care. At VBS, we extend that paradigm to pulmonary vascular and other diseases.

Our Mission
Vascular BioSciences was founded to develop products that enhance and prolong human life. At VBS, we develop disease solutions as if we were developing them for our own family – because that’s what every patient is, a member of someone’s family. We make interventional catheters to obtain endoarterial biopsies, provide molecular diagnostic solutions, and advance targeted therapies for the treatment of serious and debilitating diseases.
