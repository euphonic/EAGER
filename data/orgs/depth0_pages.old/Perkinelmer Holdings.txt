Harmonising drug-target binding data analytics on a single platform
|

Boston, USA    

In early stage medicines research, measuring in vitro drug-target interaction characteristics is a critical path activity in selecting therapeutic candidates for progression into pre-clinical models. Technologies and instrumentation used in this space are numerous. Bespoke instrument-specific data analysis software make the data handling and result-publishing workflow disjointed. It requires too many manual data handling steps leading to inefficiency and elevated risks to data integrity. In research scenarios such as this, efficient handling, processing and publishing of high volumes of experimental data is critical for objective decision making and selecting optimal therapeutic candidates.. This webinar outlines the fundamentals of a design process where an experimental analytics data workflow is being integrated into a more seamlessly interactive digital platform.. Presenters:. Thil Batuwangala Scientific Leader, Biopharma Molecular Discovery at GlaxoSmithKline . . William J. Yang Global Marketing Leader, Screening Portfolio at PerkinElmer . 11AM EDT / 3PM GMT
