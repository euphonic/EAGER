WE RECYCLE CO2
LINKING SUSTAINABILITY & PROFITABILITY
Kiverdi technology uses all natural microbes, we call them 
Nature's Super Charged Carbon Recyclers
,
 to transform CO2 and other gases into high-valued oils, nutrients and bio-based products. The materials we produce can be used in a wide range of sustainably sourced products and industrial applications. By recycling carbon dioxide, we are bridging the gap between sustainability and profitability,
 enabling 
a future of abundance

TO MAKE HIGH-VALUE OILS

Alternatives to Plant-Based Oils
Between 2000 and 2012, rainforests equaling the size of Ireland were cleared, in Indonesia, to make room for palm plantations. Why? Palm oil is now used in over 50% of consumer products, including shampoos, detergents, cosmetics, and candles. The demand for palm oil to manufacture these and other products grew from 2.5 million tons in 1972 to 58.7 million tons
in 2012. Using palm oil is cheap and easy, but competitive alternatives that are sustainable are urgently needed. What about the higher-value derivatives of palm oil? Or other plant-based oils, such as macadamia oil? 
Kiverdi's technology recycles carbon dioxide into oils with properties similar to plant-based oils and derivatives
, creating sustainable alternatives. This includes palm oil (PALM+) but it also includes higher-value oils such as macadamia oil.
BIO-BASED PRODUCTS
BIO-BASED PRODUCTS
High Value Compounds for Everyday Products
The Kiverdi technology can target a range of bio-based compounds. As an example, limonene is a compound found in citrus fruits, which is commonly used as a 
biodegradable, non-toxic cleaning formulation ingredient
 or as a solvent. Additionally, you'll find limonene predominantly listed as an additive in flavors, fragrances, and cleaning products. However, limonene has a history of price volatility due to the fact that the range supply is vulnerable to weather and other natural issues. Kiverdi's technology can produce a limonene alternative, which isn't reliant on weather conditions or geographic location, and can be manufactured in a much more
 cost effective
 way. 
& COMPLETE PROTEIN
& COMPLETE PROTEIN
Sustainable, Complete Protein
The demand for protein is on the rise. By 2050, there will be an estimated 10 billion mouths to feed, requiring protein production rates to almost double. Modern agriculture cannot sustainably expand to meet this growing demand. It has the same geographical footprint as Africa and South America put together, plus it omits more greenhouse gases than all cars, trucks, planes, and trains combined. Our natural microbes convert carefully selected CO2 into nutritious protein. We use 10,000x less land and 2,000x less water than modern agriculture does, and we have a very small carbon footprint because we recycle CO2, like plants do, instead of emitting it like animals.
