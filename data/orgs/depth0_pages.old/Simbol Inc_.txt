Flag of Algeria
The national flag of Algeria (Arabic: علم الجزائر, Berber: Acenyal n Dzayer) consists of two equal vertical bars, green and white, charged in the center with a red star and crescent.
 The white color represents peace; the green, the beauty of nature; the red, the blood of those killed fighting for independence in the Algerian War (1954 to 1962) and the star and crescent represent Islam.
The flag was adopted on July 3, 1962. A similar version was used by the Algerian government in exile from 1958 to 1962.
