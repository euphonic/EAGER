About Us
solar for tomorrow

                        Cool Earth Solar develops and builds solar power plants that are clean, renewable, and good for the planet! 
We accomplish this in two ways.                    
Commercial Solar
We install solar at commercial and industrial sites, which are ideally suited for solar given their large energy use and expansive roofs and property. We also develop large ground mount solar power plants at farms/ranches or for connection to the Utility Grid. Please see our project page for more information!
Residential Solar
We build solar projects for homeowners and residential properties! Please check out our project gallery below to see some of our recent projects. We can build one for you!
