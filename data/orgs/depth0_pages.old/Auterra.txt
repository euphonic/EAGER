Heavy, Sour Upgrading

Sulfur & Nitrogen Polishing


								More and more crudes are being discounted by high sulfur levels, high viscosity, high nitrogen levels and high acidity.  FlexUP™ can improve the overall quality of your crude oil cost effectively and improve your operating margins.  
								
FlexUP

								Many lighter streams contain sulfur levels that are marginally out of spec compared to valuable benchmarks. FlexULS provides a cost effective sulfur and nitrogen removal process that improves your assay quality.  Petrochemical manufacturers, pipeline operators with transmix issues and hydrogen constrained refiners can use FlexULS to efficiently upgrade qualities of low value feeds.
