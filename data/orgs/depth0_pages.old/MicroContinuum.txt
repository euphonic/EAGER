MicroContinuum
MicroContinuum
  is an advanced materials company that delivers next generation materials utilizing our roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing technology that can be applied to the production of a broad range of useful materials and devices. 
By applying our innovative R2R technology to fields such as flexible electronics, displays, solar energy, photonics, optics and data storage, we can offer competitive advantages through lower cost, higher throughput and larger area production. We work closely with leading technology firms, Fortune 500 companies, universities and the U.S. Government to dramatically improve products and manufacturing processes. 


These are some of the technologies we're involved in. Please click on images in the slideshow to see more.
Transparent Conductors
Low-cost patterned films for electronic devices and OLED lighting.
Flexible Electronics
Thin-film transistors and circuit components on plastic films for rollable displays, electronics and sensor networks.
