 Line of Defense

 Generation ATP monitoring offers a powerful combination of speed, versatility, portability, and accuracy for microbiological testing in any industry concerned with water. All living cells contain ATP regardless of whether they are bacteria, fungi, or any other type of microbe. As such, its measurement is a direct indication of the microbiological content in your sample. All-inclusive results in minutes provide enhanced monitoring capabilities for superior control of microorganisms in your process.

Heterotrophic Plate Count
Traditional culture-based methods are very slow (2+ days to obtain results) and very selective (<1% of total population detected). 2

 Generation ATP measures all cells to ensure that no threat goes unnoticed and results are available immediately.

 Generation ATP
vs.
Suspended Solids
Depending on the application, Suspended Solids measurements (including Turbidity and Particle Counts) may be used to indicate overall loading (wastewater) or perhaps sediment intrusion (water), but they do not isolate microbiological content. As such, are not effective ways to investigate microbiological issues and can sometimes be misleading. 2
nd
 Generation ATP monitoring quantifies the biological content of these samples, enabling the issue to be characterized and optimized much more effectively.

 Say About Us
The ATP testing is going great.  We are effectively using it to help determine if nitrification is taking place in areas of our distribution system.  We typically will see high nitrite levels and have to wait 7 days for our HPC (R2A) results.  The ATP test is giving us results that same day.
Jeff Czarnecki
Laboratory Manager, Greenville Water – Greenville, South Carolina, USA
Aurora Water (Aurora, CO) has been using LuminUltra’s test to measure and monitor Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) in the biofiltration process at the Binney Water Purification Facility (BWPF) since April 2012. This easy to perform test allows BWPF staff to quickly determine ATP levels on the biofilter GAC during start-up of the processes, as well as during routine operation.
Pamela Benskin
Sr. QC Analyst, Aurora Water – Aurora, Colorado, USA
I was amazed at the fact that we could measure total microorganisms in a matter of minutes…
M. Lee Thorton
Thorton, Musso & Bellemin Inc. – Zachary, Louisiana, USA
LuminUltra’s ATP technology as advertised should be considered as the “1
st
 Line of Defense” tool of choice and first primary testing tool for microbial activity.
Johnny D Richard
Owner, Real World Surveillance – Summit, Mississippi, USA
ATP has assisted us in maintaining bioreactor performance.  We recommend this technology to any facility looking to improve process control and plant stability.
Jeanie Grandstaff
Hopewell Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility – Hopewell, Virginia, USA
They are the only ATP test kit manufacturer that has developed a family of test kits – each optimized for a range of applications. They are also the only ATP test kit manufacturer with an ATP method that differentiates bacteria from fungi. They are undoubtedly head and shoulders above other ATP test kit manufacturers.
Frederick J. Passman, Ph.D., CMFS, FASTM, FSTLE
President Biodeterioration Control Associates, Inc.
The decision to use LuminUltra products was easy as they have positioned themselves as the industry leader in ATP testing due to their pioneering techniques and continued level of accuracy.
