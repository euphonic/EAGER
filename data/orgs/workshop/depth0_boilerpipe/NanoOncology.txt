The development of nanomaterials and nanodevices as diagnostics and therapeutics for different forms of cancer.
Advanced knowledge of cancer biology to control metastases
Pay-off
More efficacious diagnostic and targeted therapeutic to control and eliminate cancer cells.
Researchers are studying the ways in which cancer cells migrate from existing tumors to create new ones in the body. By creating the micrometer scaled adhesive islands on gold surfaces, they see individual metastatic cells take on shapes like the star depicted on the front. These shapes provide cues to cancer cell motility.
