At GlucanBio, we know natural resources are precious. And using available natural resources like biomass, as efficiently as possible, is a global game-changer. That’s why we are developing a scalable, cost-efficient technology – to lead the change.
We know what to do.
We’re not taking the typical approach; we’re focused on bio-chemicals and we’re discovering new market opportunities in addition to the existing drop-in furfural market. We’ll travel the globe to convert biomass to renewable chemicals, cost effectively.
We’re ready to do it.
North America is the ideal place to launch a commercial plant to prove our platform.  We’re exploring multiple locations and forming strategic partnerships to make it happen.
