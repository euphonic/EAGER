Medical Applications
The Immunolight platform technology converts non-invasive, penetrating forms of energy into energies capable of activating drugs inside the body, offering a new paradigm for treating cancer and other diseases
Cancer
Our highest priority at Immunolight is to translate innovations in energy conversion, our core technology, into developing new possibilities for targeted therapies to treat cancer.
Disease & Disorders
 Immunolight technology has great potential to impact a wide range of disease and other medical disorders through non-invasive, in-situ activation of bio-therapeutics.

The Immunolight platform technology leverages the latest advances in energy conversion to enable value creation in a wide range of industries including adhesives, electronics, manufacturing, solar and beyond.

Adhesives
A novel method for curing adhesives leveraging energy conversion technology enables non-line-of-sight curing and bonding at room temperature and is applicable across a wide range of industries.
Solar
The conversion of solar energy into electrical energy can be boosted by converting wavelengths of incident sunlight that can’t be trapped by solar cells (UV and IR) into wavelengths that can be converted by the solar cell.

Now Recruiting for Phase II Studies
In collaboration with the NC State College of Veterinary Medicine, Immunolight therapy for canine cancer is now recruiting potential candidates for our Phase II Study. After a successful Phase I Safety Study, the goal of this new research project is to continue ...
