About For over six decades, has provided the healthcare industry with innovative and useful products that help life science researchers accelerate the discovery process and medical diagnostic labs obtain faster, better results.
is among the top five life science companies in the world, providing instruments, software, consumables, reagents, and content for the areas of cell biology, gene expression, protein purification, protein quantitation, drug discovery and manufacture, food safety and environmental quality testing, along with science education. Our products and solutions are based on technologies to separate, purify, identify, analyze, and amplify biological materials such as antibodies, proteins, nucleic acids, cells, and bacteria.
As a leading global provider of in-vitro diagnostics supplies, our diagnostic products and systems leverage a broad range of technologies and deliver high-value clinical information in the blood transfusion, diabetes monitoring, autoimmune, and infectious disease testing markets. These products are used to support the diagnosis, monitoring, and treatment of diseases and other medical conditions.
is the world leader in clinical quality control products, services, and information systems, products that ensure the accuracy and validity of clinical test results.
Leveraging our leadership position in amplification, several years ago we established a presence in digital biology with the introduction of Droplet Digital (ddPCR). Using this technology researchers can partition segments of into thousands of microfluidic droplets and then discretely amplify and analyze each reaction resulting in the capture of highly quantitative digital answers not previously attainable. The versatility of our Droplet Digital technology has found other applications in diagnostics, most notably in the area of oncology and liquid biopsy in which the technology is used for screening and early detection of disease, diagnosis, residual disease monitoring, and therapy guidance.
Throughout our existence, we have built long-lasting customer relationships that help advance our research and development efforts in the introduction of new products and solutions. In 2018, we are in our 66th year of operation. With a global network of operations and over 8,000 employees, we are helping people live longer, healthier lives.
