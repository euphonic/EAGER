Cinemas declares future of cinema is laser and the future is now
Cinemas becomes the world’s largest investor in laser cinema projection
Content 1
​WOKINGHAM, England – (October 5, 2018) – Cinemas has chosen Christie®, a leading cinema technology manufacturer, as its exclusive laser projection partner, as it moves to convert all 700 of its theatres to pure laser technology​ . In a landmark agreement that sees becoming the largest investor in RealLaser™ in the world today, 200 Classic auditoriums will be redeveloped for RealLaser over the next two years.
​Complementing CGR's hugely-successful (Immersive Cinema Experience) theatres, which also utilize pure laser systems, will deliver the premium cinema experience. Christie's proprietary technology uses next-generation pure lasers to deliver the highest levels of brightness, contrast and colour reproduction, fulfilling the long-heralded potential of laser illumination as the preferred successor to lamp-based cinema projection technology.
"Following the premium screen success with our cinemagoers, this investment demonstrates our commitment to offering the best quality experience for our audiences, as we look to keep them coming back to time and time again," says Jocelyn Bouyssy, of Cinemas. "Having experienced what pure laser can do with premium screens, we believe it is the future of cinema, and, having successfully upgraded to projection with 10 years ago, we are delighted to again be utilising the company's latest technology developments."
The first 100 projectors will be installed in 2019, with the remaining 100 projectors to arrive in 2020. To accommodate the variety of screen sizes required to facilitate projection across Cínemas' 73 locations, the projectors will be selected from across Christie's portfolio of pure laser cinema projectors. This portfolio includes the CP4325-, the soon to be released CP2315-and CP2320-models, and further RealLaser cinema projector models to be released in the next 12 months.
"Our trusted relationship with has created an environment where we can continue to lead the way by using the best technology available," says Sebastien Bruel, CTO, Cinemas. "We've worked together since 2007, and in that time, they've helped us to advance our offering and remain at the forefront of the cinema experience. They're breaking new ground once again with pure laser projection , and we're delighted to be offering it in our cinemas."
Cínemas has experienced strong interest in its current premium screen experience, which utilises Christie's first generation of pure laser cinema projectors. As a result, the company has several years of experience and customer data with the technology. believes now is the best time to invest, as Christie's next generation of RealLaser projectors deliver 4K, high frame rate, performance and even higher contrast.
With the support of and Ciné Service (CDS) – the leading French cinema integrator – the company will oversee the upgrade of 200 classic auditoria across its network from lamp technology to pure laser.
"Our relationship with and Cínemas goes back many years." says Adil Zerouali, Senior Sales Director Cinema Europe, Christie. "It continues to flourish. As looks with us to the future of cinema, seeking out the best technologies; first and now pure laser to excite and entertain cinema audiences. And CGR's enthusiasm to do so, makes them a pleasure to work with."
The RealLaser family of projectors offers all the advantages of a high-performance laser projector in a compact 'all-in-one' form factor that eliminates the need for sub-ambient external cooling, while providing a low cost of ownership, excelling in image quality and posting an impressive operational lifetime. RealLaser delivers superior and more consistent brightness levels according to standards throughout the entire lifetime of the projector.
"is strongly committed to developing technologies that add real value for our customers. With RealLaser, we are the first manufacturer to make available the world's first laser illumination technology that qualifies as a true replacement of lamp-based illumination," said Dale Miller, Executive Vice President, Cinema, Christie.
RealLaser offers directors and producers a much-increased colour palette, approaching Rec. 2020 and over 30,000 hours of theatre operation without lamp changes. It is the only laser technology to offer brightness levels above standards throughout its natural life.
