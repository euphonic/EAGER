Policy toward Corporate Governance

In line with this mission, is working to establish a management framework befitting a world-class that operates on a global scale. We are strengthening internal controls, including rigorous compliance and risk management, and establishing a structure to facilitate rapid decision-making that is sound and transparent. Through these initiatives, we will further enhance our corporate governance, thereby maximizing corporate value.
Management Structure
At Takeda, the Board of Directors determines the fundamental policies for the Group, and management and business operations are then conducted in accordance with their decisions. Transparency of the Board of Directors is achieved through audits conducted by Audit and Supervisory Committee. Moreover, as management tasks continue to diversify, the shall establish Executive Team that consists of members who manage and supervise each function of Group under President and Chief Executive Officer, and also establish Business Review Committee (which is responsible for general management matters), Portfolio Review Committee (which is responsible for R&and products related matters), and Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee (which is responsible for internal audit, risk management and compliance matters) that review important matters to ensure systems whereby faster and more flexible work execution and deeper cooperation among the various functions take place.
