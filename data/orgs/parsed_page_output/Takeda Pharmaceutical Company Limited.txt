Through this process we gain a clear picture of long-term trends, in addition to expectations of today and the of the future. This understanding then enables us to implement our programs with full confidence in their effectiveness and sustainability.

has been working to enhance programs focused on improving access to healthcare. Our dedication to promoting “disease prevention to improve health in developing and emerging countries” represents a long-term challenge for which there is no short-term fix. We have committed to providing the necessary funds for three to ten years for each program in which we support. Since 2016, employees worldwide have taken part in an annual vote to select new Global Programs. As of 2018, we have nine programs in operation.
Sustainability underpins all of Takeda’s activities.
Committed to being a good corporate citizen, we seek to promote a sustainable society through all of our activities. Our programs are designed to create value and foster sustainability, and through building trust with society, reinforce our reputation, and contribute to the further development of our business.

Future
Our mission is to strive towards better health for people worldwide through leading innovation in medicine, with patients at the center of all that we do. From our humble beginnings over 235 years ago, to our efforts of today that span the world, our dedication to this mission remains unchanged. This is the center of the global group, where colleagues from around the world gather to work with passion, commitment and creativity towards our shared goal.From the bustling and vibrant Edo period and continuing through to the present day, Nihonbashi has long been instrumental in shaping Japan’s economy and culture. This area is also very important to Takeda, as Nihonbashi-Honcho, home now to our Global Headquarters, has been the base for our operations in Tokyo since the Meiji period. From our founding in 1781, we have been driven by the core values of Takeda-ism (Integrity, Fairness, Honesty and Perseverance). We will continue to embody the spirit, working in harmony with the local community and striving to become a best-in-class global company.

Global Ethics & Compliance
The Global Code of Conduct and Reinforcement of the Global Ethics & Compliance Program
believes that, in addition to complying with all applicable laws and regulations, it is essential for employees and executives to conduct business in line with the highest ethical and moral standards. At Takeda, this is expressed through our Values - “Takeda-ism”, and our four priorities of Patient-Trust-Reputation-Business. 
To set a standard, we established the Global Code of Conduct, which gives us a framework for achieving the ethical and moral standards we aspire to. It sets out the principles we must follow every day and helps us preserve the integrity that is ingrained in our heritage, and which underpins Takeda-ism and our four priorities. The Global Code of Conduct applies to all employees and enables all of us to make everyday decisions in line with our Values.

Efforts toward three contagious diseases in Africa: Initiative 
Since 2010, we have continued to donate ¥100 million for 10 years to training health care personnel in Kenya, Tanzania, and Nigeria through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria
In March 2010, launched the "Initiative", a financial aid program designed to develop and strengthen the capacity of healthcare workers through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (The Global Fund).
Currently, many millions of people die each year from one of the world's three major communicable diseases: HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. This constitutes a major obstacle to development and growth in developing countries; therefore, it is critical that the international community addresses these disease issues. African countries, in particular, suffer from very severe shortages of healthcare workers, which hinders their efforts to deliver the healthcare services needed to overcome such diseases. 
The Initiative aligns with international frameworks, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and United Nations Global Compact, and is positioned as a concrete effort to prevent the spread of the three major infectious diseases of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, which is one of the critical issues in global health.  
■Donations
■Application
Takeda's donations support Global Fund-recommended projects in three countries and are aimed at helping to strengthen health systems, mainly by developing and upskilling healthcare-related human resources 
*The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (The Global Fund):  Donations within Japan are accepted by the Japan Center for International Exchange, which is the secretariat for the Friends of the Global Fund, Japan. 
How our Initiative is formulated
What is the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria?
Based in Geneva, the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (The Global Fund) is a non-profit organization dedicated to raising and supplying funds to help prevent and treat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. The Global Fund was formed in 2002 in response to calls from then Secretary General Kofi Annan and the G8 group of nations, in the wake of the G8 summit held in Kyushu/Okinawa in 2000, at which the Japanese government declared the fight against contagious diseases to be a major international challenge. Since its creation in 2002, the Global Fund is supporting about $ 4 billion annually to projects in over 100 countries and regions, providing treatment for 11 million people, anti-tuberculosis treatment for 17.4 million people and 795 million insecticide-treated nets for the prevention of malaria.
HIV/Situation in Nigeria
Nigeria, Africa’s biggest economy and the most populous nation, has the second largest burdens of both and in Africa and is classified as a high TB, HIV, and MDR-burden country. It has one of the highest burdens in Africa in HIV-mother-to-child transmission, maternal and child mortality. The low coverage of HIV/services presents a formidable challenge. Intensification of efforts to scale up prevention, detection and treatment of the disease is therefore necessary.
Malaria Situation in Tanzania
Malaria is the single most significant disease in Tanzania, and approximately 44 million people (90% of the population) live in areas with prevalent seasonal malaria transmission. Tanzania has been successful in demonstrating significant impact in the fight against malaria; however, malaria remains a major public health problem accounting for 40% of the outpatient cases and about 36% of all deaths in Tanzanian children aged less than five years. The government of Tanzania aims to reduce its malaria prevalence below 1% by 2020. 
Support Programs in Kenya
Steer the Country towards the Achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in Line with the Global Stop Strategy
Tuberculosis Situation in Kenya
Kenya is one of the 30 high-burden countries for that together account for more than 80 percent of the world’s cases. is one of the leading causes of illness and death in the country with a disproportionate impact on women and children. The burden of in Kenya has shown consistent reduction over the years thanks to a strong program and the international funding support. Between 1990 and 2014, Kenya made remarkable progress - the case detection rate increased from 30 percent to 80 percent. However, significant challenges remain and technical and financial support is needed, especially in improving laboratory capacity and strengthening multidrug-resistant treatment.

Risk & Crisis Management
Takeda’s Approach to Risk Management
shares its Corporate Philosophy, which comprises its Vision, Mission, Values and Strategic Roadmap, with the entire Group and promotes the creation of a disciplined and sound corporate culture. Based on the above mentioned principle, has created a risk management system, making risk management an important component of corporate governance, functioning coordinated with internal control: promotes construction of a system in which each group responds adequately to risks and crises and ensures business continuity, and facilitates disciplined management in the Group. With regard to risk management, the “Global Risk Management Policy,” and the “Global Crisis Management Policy” respectively lay out the structure of risk management system including BCPs and crisis management systems of the Group.
Management of Major Risks
The “Global Risk Management Policy” provides a uniform process of identifying, measuring, mitigating and reporting on significant risks with the objective of aligning risk appetite with strategy and improving risk responses. Takeda’s major potential risks include research and development, intellectual property rights, decline of sales due to the expiration of patents, etc., side-effects, drop in prices caused by measures for constraint of cost of medicines, fluctuation of foreign exchange rates, corporate acquisitions, country risks, stable supply, litigation, and security and information control. The person(s) in charge of each function control and manage these risk factors in each area of charge from the aspect of qualitative and quantitative criteria in designing and implementation of mid-range and annual plans and shall take all necessary measures or remedies available to avoid and minimize such risk factors, depending on the degree and content of the risk the is exposed to, in compliance with the countermeasures to cope therewith and any contingency plans.
Approach to Crisis Management
strives to ensure that all possible preventive measures are taken to avoid potential crises in accordance with the “Group Global Crisis Management Policy,” which comprises basic policies, rules and standards for crisis management. The policy also underpins systems and operations we have put in place to respond to each type of crisis swiftly and appropriately. In this way, we aim to minimize any potential harm to employees, any impact on Takeda’s finances, and any effect on society at large in the event of a crisis.
Crisis Management Structure
The Group companies are responsible for establishing their own crisis management systems, implementing preventive measures, and taking appropriate action if a crisis occurs. In the case of a crisis that has a major impact on and requires company-wide action, a “Global Crisis Management Committee” chaired by the President & of coordinates a common understanding of the situation and any relevant information. The Committee directs each to take countermeasures, later following up on the implementation of the countermeasures.

Charity for fighting against cancer: Global Relay for Life
Support the people who fight against cancer with the American Cancer Society.
announced that they will support the projected expansion of the American Cancer Society (ACS)'s Global Relay For Life (RFL) into an additional 20 countries by 2020. The program is a global grassroots movement that unites communities across the globe to come together and honor cancer survivors, remember loved ones lost and provide an opportunity to fight back through raising awareness, fundraising and advocating for policies that help save lives.
According to the World Health Organization, an estimated 14 million people are diagnosed with cancer each year and approximately eight million succumb to the disease. The burden of cancer is expected to grow significantly in the future, and will have a major impact on those in developing countries. To kick-off the global expansion initiative, training for a partner organization started in Uruguay, one of the newly added countries, in September 2016.
■Training Implemented in Uruguay
Members of the American Cancer Society, local partner organization staff, and volunteers participated in a two-day training program in Montevideo, Uruguay.
■About the American Cancer Society
 The American Cancer Society is a global grassroots force of 2 million volunteers saving lives in every community. As the largest voluntary health organization, the Society's efforts have contributed to a 23 percent decline in cancer death rates in the since 1991, and a 50 percent drop in smoking rates. We're finding cures as the nation's largest private, not-for-profit investor in cancer research, ensuring people facing cancer have the help they need and continuing the fight for access to quality health care, lifesaving screenings and more.
For more infomation,please visit American Cancer Society Website.
