wordpress travel themesMichael Cyrus, CEO
Michael has over 30 years of experience in technology development, executive management and international projects.  Michael served as of Inplane Photonics, a venture funded company acquired by CyOptics / Avago. Inplane was a leading practitioner of “glass on silicon” Planar Lightwave Circuit (PLC) technology, which supports complex and versatile photonic integration. At its core, Inplane had a versatile technology which enabled the fabrication of integrated optical circuits for data transmission, distribution, detection, and conditioning on monolithic silicon chips. This allowed the miniaturization of functional components in optical communication networks and the hybrid integration of semiconductor sources and detector devices to achieve monolithic functionality at a subsystem level. Such integration delivers smaller, lighter and more robust solutions than any others available today.
Michael was Executive Chairman of the venture-funded company Kodeos Communications, which was acquired by Finisar (NASDAQ: FNSR). Kodeos’ breakthrough signal processing technologies enable transmission over greater distances while making the overall system more tolerant to dispersion. Additionally, the signal processing algorithms enabled spectral shaping that yielded higher spectral efficiency for greater bandwidth utilization.
Prior to joining Inplane, Michael was the of Defense Group, which provides mission-enabling solutions for top tier defense contractors and system integrators. Defense develops high-performance digital and fiber optic transmission subsystems and networks for advanced air and sea avionics platforms; high-bandwidth technology for optical systems and networks; and advanced Homeland security technologies.
Prior to Defense Photonics, Michael was President and of Cyrospace, Inc., where he was responsible for executive management of a complex core organization and its spin-off activities and initiatives. He has conducted R&initiatives on Plasma Rocket Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating for long duration space flights, Nano Satellites concepts, Alternative Energy technologies, Personal Locator System, Light Bullet technology. Additionally, Michael worked to incubate several start-up companies with unique products.
Prior to Cyrospace, Michael was Vice President of Operations at Lockheed Martin where he performed operational activities of Lockheed’s Space Operations and its programs with 5000 employees. Direct responsibilities included M&Business Integration, Strategic Initiatives, R&D, Manufacturing and Engineering activities. Additionally, he directed Advanced Programs and Lunar/Mars related R&programs.
Allan Bruce, Materials
Allan leads Sunlight’s efforts in manufacturing multi-functional skins and power systems. He has a background in successful small company leadership combined with more than 25 years technical experience in relevant  technologies. He is a recognized expert and  innovator in  new materials and fabrication processes  for optics, and communication systems. Allan was a co-founder of  Inplane and provided business and technical leadership in his capacities as President, and of Business Development from inception through the company’s acquisition by CyOptics / Avago. During his tenure, Allan was instrumental in establishing Inplane as a leader in photonic integration on a Planar Lightwave Circuit (PLC) platform. The company developed business in both defense and commercial markets and provided Highly Integrated Photonic (HIP) products including Erbium Doped Waveguide amplifiers (EDWAs) and lossless (subsystems-on-a-chip) specifically designed to meet customer needs for small, high performance, light, robust and manufacturable devices for communication networks.
Prior to Inplane Photonics, Allan was a Research Scientist at AT&Bell Laboratories, later Lucent Technologies. He was a principal investigator and technical leader on in-house and government funded programs.  His scientific contributions included developing novel “best in class” and a wide range of materials applicable to “multi-delta” PLCs. He worked closely with the Optical Fiber and Optoelectronic Products Divisions on new product implementation.  One of his prominent contributions was the stability enhancement of Lithium Niobate Waveguide Modulators. This was a key differentiator which enabled Lucent/Agere to achieve market dominance from 1999-2001. In 2001 the revenue stream from this product family approached $1B.
Allan was awarded a B.Sc. with first class honors and a Phin Chemistry from the University of Aberdeen, Scotland. He is a fellow of the American Ceramic Society and a past-Chair of its Glass and Optical Materials Division. He has published more than 80 technical papers, edited several books and currently holds many Patents and several European Patents.
Sergey Frolov, Technology
Sergey is leading our design efforts and related technical development programs. He brings his expertise in product design and development, technological know-how and extensive knowledge of optical and solid-state physics to pursue new approaches in developing clean renewable energy sources, particularly those based on solar energy. Most recently, Sergey has been the of Strategic Initiatives at Inplane Photonics, acquired by CyOptics / Avago. In this capacity, Sergey was responsible for exploring new technologies, applications and business opportunities.
Prior to that, Sergey was the Director of Device Design at Inplane Photonics, leading the optical design efforts in integrated planar lightwave circuits (PLCs) and waveguide amplifiers. Sergey was with Inplane from the launch of the company in 2001 and was instrumental in helping Inplane become the international leader in optical waveguide integration and the only company in the world to commercially produce waveguide-based, Er-doped optical amplifiers. Based on its unique technology, Inplane developed a suite of integrated products consisting of a large library of waveguide elements with different functionalities based on different optical materials that can be seamlessly combined on the same optical chip in order to form a miniature optical subsystem. Such subsystems are then able to perform several complex functions and displace a large number of discrete components in an optical network. Inplane team pushed the limits of technology beyond what any other company in the world could achieve today. Among these achievements are first demonstrations of multiple 3waveguide integration, hybrid high-power laser integration and stabilization, manufacturing of amplified reconfigurable optical add-drop modules on a chip and others.
Prior to joining Inplane, Sergey worked at Bell Laboratories of Lucent Technologies as a primary investigator and a member of the technical staff. There, he conducted research on a number of different materials and their applications in telecommunications, electronics and display technologies. Among these were novel organic and inorganic semiconductors such as conducting polymers, ultrapure semiconducting organic crystals, multiple-quantum well lasers, quantum cascade lasers, exotic glasses and organo-metallic compounds. Sergey lead studies of optical and electronic processes in these materials using various advanced spectroscopic tools such as ultrafast laser spectroscopy. He developed a one-of-a-kind laser system capable of probing optical materials by multiple synchronized laser beams with better than 100 fsec time resolution. This system was particularly useful in investigating various opto-electronic conversion processes such as those occurring in lasers, photodetectors and solar cells.
Prior to Lucent, Sergey worked as a research scientist at the John Dixon Laser Institute at the University of Utah and General Physics Institute in Moscow where he studied electro-optical properties of various thin-film semiconductors, including amorphous silicon, fullerenes and amorphous III-materials. Sergey has a degree in Applied Mathematics from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (Russia) and a Phdegree in Physics from the University of Utah. Sergey has authored more than 30 papers and currently holds many Patents and several European Patents.
