About Sustainability 
Sustainability 
Share
GCP’s products and services work together to create safer, more durable and more efficient structures. They improve the performance and efficiency of our built environment – including homes and schools, offices and factories, roads and sidewalks, bridges and tunnels.
Through energy efficiency and a reduction in material use, we lower costs for our customers while reducing their use of natural resources.
Sustainable Buildings
Sustainable design creates buildings that are beautiful and functional, with improved social and environmental performance, while saving money through more efficient use of energy and materials.  Sustainable buildings safeguard human health and safety; minimize negative environmental impacts; exhibit resilience during severe weather; and extend the structure’s useful life.
Many products help to achieve these outcomes. Our Passive Fire Protection products prevent or delay the collapse of steel and concrete structures exposed to fire – providing additional time for occupants to escape and for emergency response.   Air Barriers and Weather Resistive Barriers reduce energy use for heating and cooling and help to prevent rot and mold growth. Roofing underlayments, and below-grade waterproofing help to protect the buildings on which they are installed, particularly during storm activity.
Cement Additives and Concrete Admixtures
products can improve environmental performance for our cement and concrete customers. Our Grinding Aids and Quality Improvers make cement manufacturing more efficient, reducing carbon emissions. Our concrete admixtures reduce the amount of cement needed to achieve a given strength specification.  Other products reduce quarry waste, lower total project costs, and enhance worker safety.
VERIFI® In-Transit Concrete Management System
is at the forefront of using “connected devices” to save customers time and money – while improving environmental and safety performance. Our patented VERIFI® technology uses truck-mounted sensors, advanced data analytics, and automated admixture inputs so that ready-mix concrete moves from the plant to the job site more efficiently and with minimal waste. VERIFI® provides customers with several financial and sustainability advantages: 
Improved quality control enables customers to meet strict performance requirements without the need to over design mixes with unnecessary cement.
More accurate inputs of water and additives reduce the number of rejected concrete loads, and their associated costs and environmental impacts.
Fewer concrete drum rotations on the way to the job site can lead to substantial fuel savings – bringing costs and environmental impacts down even further.

Knowledge: Insights into construction Waterproofing for a green roof
Waterproofing for a green roof
Share
October 15, 2018
Studies abound that green roofs reduce the effects of urban heat islands. They're also far more aesthetically pleasing than a basic, blacktop roof. Green roofs provide shade, comfort and a place to enjoy the greenery in an otherwise concrete jungle.
The answer to "Why a green roof?" seems rather straightforward, then. And, if you’re a waterproofing contractor, you’re likely to see more projects like these on the horizon. There is, however, some nuance to green roof projects. For instance, who is responsible for what? From a waterproofing perspective, you may want to consider the following…
Draw the line between waterproofing and the green layers
First of all, your installation ends before any green roof construction begins. The waterproofing layer is, in fact, usually the last layer to be before the green roof contractor gets to work.
Ensure that the type of waterproofing system you choose is suited for a green roof
green roof system usually includes a root barrier to protect the waterproofing from aggressive plant roots that can penetrate the membrane.
Lay down a strong membrane
If you lay down a strong waterproofing membrane from the get-go, leaks may not become an issue, even under the most aggressive green roof roots. 
SILCOR® 900MP
 and 
SILCOR® 900HA
liquid waterproofing membranes
 meet standard D624—Standard Test Method for Tear Strength of Conventional Vulcanized Rubber and Thermoplastic Elastomers. SILCOR® liquid waterproofing membranes can also endure long exposure times. This is crucial protection in case the green roof contractor experiences delays in installing the fabric, drainage or growth medium layers.
Speak to an expert about using SILCOR® liquid waterproofing membrane on your next project

About Transparency in Supply Chain Disclosure
Transparency in Supply Chain Disclosure
Share
is dedicated to conducting business around the world in accordance with the highest level of legal, and ethical principles, and we have instilled a culture of dignity and mutual respect in our employees worldwide.
strongly believes in socially responsible business practices wherever we operate, as stated in our 
code of conduct
. We expect our suppliers to behave responsibly and to adhere to local laws as well as ensure their commitment to avoid human trafficking and slavery in the marketplace. We recognize that the relationship we have with our Suppliers is critical to our success and expect very high standards from them in the key areas related to 
Human Rights and Labor Standards, Business Ethics, and the Environment. Our expectation is that they be self–monitoring and self-reporting.
This is a summary of GCP’s current efforts towards Transparency in the Supply Chain:
All key Suppliers are expected to sign GCP’s code of conduct or provide their own internal code of conduct. 
	
With over 5,000 Suppliers, we have sequentially introduced this effort, initially targeting suppliers with whom we have a significant annual spend.

Conventional concrete has long been the material of choice for some of the world’s largest building structures. It does, however, come with some headaches (not to mention backaches), due to the intense amount of labor involved with placing and finishing it. To alleviate these challenges, CONCERA® admixtures were created to enable the production of control flow concrete, a segregation-resistant, high flow concrete – enabling faster construction with less labor and equipment to place and finish. Offering a slump flow between conventional concrete and self-consolidating concrete, control flow concrete works well for horizontal slabs, elevated decks, as well as vertical walls and columns.
In this video, Evers Construction shows what control flow concrete is like in action. “We get a high flowing mix that goes around well around anchor bolt settings and rebar and finished well and holds together on slab,” said Randy Evers. “We like the ability to maintain a high slump with very low segregation that allows us to place the concrete without adding a lot of water or other admixtures. It flows very well and fills in voids with minimum vibrating.”
Contact a specialist to discuss using CONCERA® admixtures on your next project.

Knowledge: Insights into construction Control flow concrete for mass pours
Control flow concrete for mass pours
Share
October 01, 2018
Mass pours in 
concrete construction
 have typically been used for foundations, columns, beams, as well as enormous structures like dams and bridges. 
What are mass pours?
Many structural elements, such as shear walls and transfer girders, require large amounts of concrete. Traditionally, jobs were considered mass pours if the cross-sectional dimension of the concrete element was three feet across or more. 
For these massive jobs, there is a concern both about the maximum temperature produced during concrete production and maximum temperature shifts that can occur before the concrete finishes curing. During the cement hydration process, the interior temperature of the concrete rises, while the outer concrete may be cooling. If the external and internal temperatures of the concrete differ too much, the concrete element will crack. 
What is control flow concrete?
In the past, concrete contractors had two types of concrete to choose from in terms of flowability:
Conventional concrete is relatively inexpensive, but is very labor-intensive to place and finish
Self-consolidating concrete has high flow, but is typically more expensive due to its special mix design and requires more intense jobsite quality assurance to ensure the right consistency
Control flow concrete bridges the gap between conventional and Self-consolidating concrete. It offers a higher flow than conventional concrete, using a conventional mix design.

How does control flow concrete help with mass pours?
Improved concrete quality.
 High flowing concrete is very beneficial for mass pours. However, in the past, concrete producers needed high cement content, which would result in higher core temperatures, in order to achieve high flow. Control flow concrete alleviates this problem. It provides high flow and segregation resistance, without requiring high cement content. It is created by adding CONCERA® admixture to a conventional mix design. Sthere’s no need for high cement content to produce control flow concrete, the core temperature of the concrete will be lower. As a result, the difference between core and outer temperature of the concrete will be lower and there will be less likelihood of cracking. Less cracking will help protect against corrosion of the reinforcing steel. 
Reduced labor costs.
 Mass pours require tremendous resources. For example, it took 18 hours to pour the foundation for San Francisco’s largest skyscraper, the Salesforce Tower. Seven boom pumps– along with a small army of workers – moved concrete from the truck to the foundation. Control flow concrete cuts labor hours, sit’s easier to place and finish than traditional concrete. On mass pour jobs, those labor efficiencies are even greater given the number of workers typically needed for the project. 
Faster construction.
 Control flow concrete is extremely workable, which helps accelerate project times. There is minimal need for vibration due to the high flow, as well as its responsiveness to external energy. The concrete moves quickly in response to external energy and can also be stopped quickly when needed. In addition, the admixture extends slump flow life, which helps make placement of the concrete easier.  
More predictable results.
 CONCERA® admixtures have strong water tolerance, so the 
ready mix concrete
 is less likely to have slump flow fluctuations. This helps ensure a consistent quality of concrete from batch to batch.

Control flow concrete construction
Tilt up construction
Top down construction
Precast construction
Mass pours
High rise construction
Bridge construction
One of the latest innovations in concrete construction is the development of an entirely new type of concrete. Control flow concrete was created to bridge the gap between conventional concrete and self-consolidating concrete. While both types of concrete have their advantages, they do have drawbacks for certain applications. For one, there is a vast amount of labor involved with moving and placing conventional concrete. This is a more pressing issue as the construction industry continues to face labor shortages. 
Self-consolidating concrete flows easily to alleviate much of the labor burden. However, it is more expensive to produce due to specialized mix designs, high powder content as well as extra needed at the job site and at the plant.
This is where control flow concrete comes in. It flows more easily but has the same segregation resistance as conventional concrete, without the need for extra Sit is high flowing and highly responsive to external energy, it requires minimal vibration during placement. CONCERA® water reducing admixtures make it possible to create control flow concrete using conventional mix designs. This significantly reduces labor costs on the jobsite.
The slump flows are between that of conventional concrete and self-consolidating concrete.
Concrete type
Slump/ slump flow
Leveling characteristics
Conventional concrete
6-8” slump
Requires vibration for consolidation
Control flow concrete
16-25” slump flow
Requires minimal vibration for consolidation. Does not completely self level, so it can be placed even on small grades
Self-consolidating concrete
Greater than 25” slump flow
Self-leveling and consolidating
Control flow concrete construction
Control flow concrete is a segregation-resistant mix that can have both high compressive strength and high passing ability, meaning it discharges quickly and can be placed more easily than conventional slump concrete. This makes it ideal for many types of concrete construction projects.

Tilt-up construction
This is a popular means of building large structures, such as warehouses, because the work can be performed quickly and usually with lower construction costs compared to traditional masonry construction projects. The building’s walls are poured at the jobsite on the large slab, and then raised into position around the building perimeter. In this environment, the casting surface needs to be flat, with minimal imperfections. It is easier to accomplish this with control flow concrete than it is with conventional concrete, which requires considerable energy to place and finish. Casting the walls is also easier with control flow concrete and in some cases will eliminate the need for a pump.
^ return to top
Top down construction
This construction method allows work to be performed both above ground and below ground concurrently. This saves a great deal of time, particularly on large underground projects like parking structures and transit systems. Typically, there are space limitations in top down construction, and it can be difficult to get large machines in for tasks such as vibrating concrete. In these projects, control flow concrete is beneficial, sit significantly limits the need for vibrating concrete. Control flow concrete also extends the slump life of the concrete, which can come in handy on top down construction projects, as the contractor can pour the concrete in foundation piles and have enough time for steel king posts to be inserted after the pour is completed.
^ return to top
Precast construction
The market for precast concrete is growing due to the appeal of faster construction. Precasters can now use control flow concrete to increase production. This high flow, segregation resistant concrete can be quickly placed into forms, reducing labor and equipment costs. This is especially helpful in molds with complex reinforcement sthe concrete can quickly fill in the gaps. This type of concrete works well for precast concrete beams, columns and underground elements, as well as for architectural concrete.
^ return to top
Mass pours
Major building projects such as foundations, dams and bridges often use mass pours. Often concrete contractors prefer to use high flow concrete for these projects to reduce the labor involved with moving and placing the concrete. However, in the past high flow concrete required high cement content, which increased the concrete’s core temperature. This could be an issue shaving too large a differential between the concrete’s internal and external temperature can cause cracking. Control flow concrete eliminates this problem because it allows for high flow, without additional cement content. 
^ return to top
High rise construction
As new buildings soar even higher, it’s beneficial to have the ability to use control flow concrete sit easily flows across long distances. In addition, it’s important for architects and builders of these iconic structures to have maximum flexibility. This type of concrete offers this flexibility, as it can easily flow around complex support systems.

Another advantage of control flow concrete for high rise construction is that it minimizes the need for vibration in placing the concrete. As noted in Concrete Construction magazine, “because column and wall forms are usually rather high and reinforcing bars are often spaced quite closely, workmen must be careful in depositing and vibrating concrete in this work.” Using control flow concrete minimizes the need for vibrating the concrete, helping to reduce safety risks. 
^ return to top
Bridge construction
In the past, design engineers specified conventional concrete for these jobs. However, it is cumbersome to move this type of concrete through heavy steel reinforcement in the bridge’s supporting columns. Using control flow concrete is a desirable alternative, because it reduces the amount of labor involved with getting the concrete in place. It can also reduce safety concerns sworkers need to spend less time climbing high forms to place the concrete. The concrete easily moves into place with minimal vibration.

Knowledge: Insights into construction Making the most of air entrained concrete
Making the most of air entrained concrete
Share
October 01, 2018
Air entraining agents (AEA) are used to entrain air in concrete when a structure will be exposed to moisture, freeze thaw cycles and deicing chemicals. Concrete is a porous material and water moves through these pores.  When temperatures drop below freezing, water in concrete begins to freeze and the powerful expansive forces of freezing water can damage the concrete. Air entraining agents entrain air by generating millions of stable, microscopic air voids in concrete. These uniformly dispersed air voids provide relief from the expansive freezing water, thereby preventing freeze thaw deterioration.
If concrete exposed to freeze thaw cycling is not properly air entrained, the durability of the concrete will be compromised and the service life of the structure will be shortened.  Some examples of structures that require air entrained concrete in cold regions include parking structures, bridge decks, highway pavements, curbs, and sidewalks. 
Concrete producers, contractors, engineers and specifiers must work together to assure quality concrete practices are followed when using air entrained concrete.  Several best practices include:
Follow concrete specifications for your region.
 For example, in the U.S., air entrained concrete specifications should be clearly written and comply with Chapter 19 of 318R-14 (Building Code Requirements for Structural Concrete). Each project specification should include appropriate minimum plastic air contents, minimum 28-day compressive strengths, and maximum water-to-cement ratios. 
Use appropriate mix designs and quality materials.
 The concrete producer must assure the mix design criteria submitted for each project are achievable and meet the applicable specification for air entrained concrete. For example, most specs include a plastic air content range, typically in the 5-8% range. If the plastic air misses the spec on the low end, the concrete may not be freeze durable. Conversely, if it misses the spec on the high end, compressive strength may be compromised.  In addition, coarse aggregate and all other concrete mixture constituents should be tested and approved for use in freeze-thaw environments.
Another way to improve the quality of concrete is to use CONCERA® admixtures, which reduce the amount of water needed in the mix, while improving workability.
Learn more about CONCERA® admixtures for control flow concrete
Place, finish, and cure properly.
 The resistance of concrete to freezing and thawing cycling is also impacted by placing, finishing, and curing procedures. For example, over finishing or using excessive water on exterior flatwork can significantly degrade the quality of the air void system. Additionally, improper or minimal curing can negatively affect the strength and durability properties of the concrete surface. Refer to 304 (Guide for Measuring, Mixing, Transporting, and Placing Concrete) for details on proper procedures and acceptable practices. 
Test! Test! Test!
  The quantity and quality of plastic air generated on any one given day is dependent on many often-changing variables. These include material (cement, pozzolan, aggregates) variation, ambient/concrete temperature fluctuations, and an array of production and placement techniques. Air entrained concrete should be consistently tested in the field using ASTM-compliant plastic air and unit weight (density) tests to ensure in specification plastic air contents are achieved at the point of placement. Air entraining agent dosage rates should be adjusted at the plant if plastic air contents are out of specification.

Knowledge: Insights into construction How green roofs cool urban heat islands
How green roofs cool urban heat islands
Share
October 23, 2018
You may have heard of the term "urban heat island." It's really just a fancy way of saying that, in certain areas of a city, heat energy concentrates to raise the temperature.
Cities are, for the most part, manmade and thus don't possess the same characteristics to dissipate heat that naturally forming structures and ecosystems enjoy. Typical cities, for instance, don't grow as much vegetation, which provides shade and the cooling effect of evapotranspiration. The materials that constitute a city—concrete, asphalt, etc.—absorb more of the sun's solar energy. They heat up and warm the air around them. The very geometry of most cities is unnatural. These materials that don't dissipate heat very well, also bounce short-wave radiation between the relatively close, tall buildings. And remember: these buildings are filled with people. Anthropogenic heat emissions from heating and air conditioning units, other electrical use, etc. contribute to warmth in the surrounding air. Clear skies and calm winds will only amplify these effects in an urban heat island (UHI).
What can be done to lower these heat elevations? We can't raze the city and start from scratch. We also can't ignore the heightened heat index either.
According to the 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
, elevated summertime temps increase energy demand for cooling. This can lead to rolling brown- or blackouts. The higher energy consumption also leads to more burning of fossil fuels, which release air pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. Heightened temperatures can also result in the formation of ground-level ozone, an unhealthy concoction of noxious gases.
What we can do is adapt.
Green roofs, a growing trend all over the world, are one of the most comprehensive answers to alleviate heat from UHIs. They can grow, flourish atop city roofs and bring the temperature down in the following ways:
Evapotranspiration: Green roofs combine plants' power of transpiration—the process of moving water up from roots to pedals and leaves—and evaporation—conversion of water from liquid to gas—to remove heat from the air. The water sucks up heat energy as it evaporates from plants and soil (growing medium) into the now cooler atmosphere.
Green roofs, soaked and swollen like a sponge after a rainstorm, store large amounts of heat in the retaining water. The heavy moisture regulates temperature fluctuations.
Find a good liquid waterproofing solution for your next green roof project
Green roofs, when dry, act as an insulator, decreasing the flow of heat through the roof. Less heat thus escapes from the building into the air.
Green roofs provide additional benefits, filtering storm runoff and absorbing pollutants like CO
2
. If you think about it, reducing CO
2
 in the air also reduces heat (global warming) in the long run. The absorptive quality of a lush green roof also acts as an effective sound barrier for noisy city streets.
Furthermore, green roofs can optimize the performance of rooftop solar panels. According to 
, the cooling effect of a green roof keeps the surrounding air around panels at a temperature within which the photovoltaics can operate most efficiently.
An elastomeric 
liquid waterproofing membrane
 can help complement a green roof system

Knowledge: Insights into construction Net zero building design and air leakage
Net zero building design and air leakage
Share
October 01, 2018
Is it possible to create a building with a net energy consumption of zero? An increasing number of homeowners and organizations concerned about reducing their carbon footprint are working to achieve that elusive goal.
Put simply, a “net zero” building—or zero net energy (ZNE) building—is one where the total amount of energy used annually is equal to the energy created by the building from renewable sources on site, including solar, wind or hydro power generation. building may not necessarily be “off the grid,” but over the course of a year, it will generate at least as much energy as it consumes from the commercial power grid.
core requirement of net zero construction is an intense focus on energy efficiency in order to minimize energy consumption. This involves a wide range of building design strategies, from site selection and landscaping that reduce heating and cooling requirements, to high-tech building materials and climate control systems. Careful design of the 
building envelope
 is also critically important. Indeed, establishing an airtight building enclosure is one of the core principles for building design.
1
Uncontrolled air leakage across the enclosure can be responsible for much of the energy use for heating/cooling of a building, as well as being the primary source of moisture within the structure.1  continuous air barrier system is essential to minimizing air leakage and  reducing energy loss. 
How much air leakage is too much? One firm specializing in net-zero building design has proposed that air leakage not exceed 1.5 air changes per hour (ACH) when measured under a pressurization test with a 50 Pascal (Pa) pressure differential between the inside and outside of the building.1 By comparison, the 2012 International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) calls for air leakage to be ≤ 3 at 50 Pa for climate zones 3 – 8 (all but the hottest southern regions) and ≤ 5 for climate zones 1 -2 (Florida, southern Texas and part of Arizona).

Minimizing air leakage is just part of the formula for achieving net-zero energy consumption. Other important elements include insulation that exceeds energy code requirements; water and moisture control; siting to benefit from solar, wind or hydro power sources; and high-efficiency mechanical equipment and lighting. The careful selection and installation of a continuous air barrier optimized for the particular building envelope, climate and site is critically important for achieving the goals of net-zero design and construction.

One of the challenges in shipping ready-mix concrete, from the plant to the job site, is the mysterious "mile in the middle," where concrete slump is uncertain.
VERIFI® in-transit concrete management system
 solves for this by way of cloud-connected sensors mounted on the ready-mix truck. They report back to concrete professionals important data about the mixing concrete—slump, temperature, drum rotations on the truck, etc. Never before has there been this heightened visibility into the mixing concrete to truly the ready-mix delivery. The result is loads arriving at the job site within specified slump and ready to pour immediately.

Knowledge: Insights into construction Using control flow concrete for tunnel linings
Using control flow concrete for tunnel linings
Share
October 19, 2018
Concrete linings are a fundamental part of ensuring the structural integrity of tunnels, but pumping and placing the concrete for these jobs is a cumbersome process. Numerous challenges can arise. For example:
Access within the tunnel is very limited, so concrete with very good flow is critical. 
Conventional concrete is not ideal for this application sit does not flow well and it can cause an obstruction in the pump, resulting in costly delays. 
Why self-consolidating concrete is not ideal for tunnel linings
Some contractors have tackled these challenges by using self-consolidating concrete, due to its high flow and workability. However, there can be some difficulties involved with using this type of concrete.
Self-consolidating concrete generally requires a specialized mix design, which adds to the cost.
Producing self-consolidating concrete is a fine balancing act that requires on-site quality control, which gets expensive, particularly given the labor shortages in the construction industry.
Control flow concrete – a solution to these challenges 
Control flow concrete was created to bridge the gap between conventional concrete and self-consolidating concrete. The compressive strengths of control flow concrete and conventional concrete are equivalent. However, control flow concrete offers higher flow at a lower cost than self-consolidating concrete, and it is also segregation resistant, making it a good solution for concrete tunnel linings. 
Concrete discharges quickly, pumps easily and can be placed with minimal energy. This can result in a faster construction schedule with the same or higher quality concrete. 
Using control flow concrete can also help contractors run a leaner operation, shandling the higher flowing concrete requires much less manual labor. 
Control flow concrete is handy in confined spaces like tunnels. It has a wider slump flow range than conventional concrete. It flows well to easily fill the form, creating a smooth, strong tunnel lining.
introduced admixtures under the CONCERA® brand that enable the production of segregation resistant concrete with a flow range of 16-25” (410-635mm) using conventional mix designs.

Knowledge: Insights into construction Foundation waterproofing: When and why to use it? 
Foundation waterproofing: When and why to use it? 
Share
October 10, 2018
In some construction projects, there is a need to apply waterproofing before the foundation concrete is cast. This approach is commonly needed in high water table environments in urban locations and on any structure where the owners are concerned about water infiltration through the foundation slab or confined walls. 
Until the 1990s, there were a range of sheet membranes used for this purpose. However, these solutions were often not ideal for such applications. The problem was the lack of adhesive bond between the membrane and the concrete cast against it. This meant that even if minor damage occurred to the membrane, water could pass between the membrane and the concrete. Once the water found cracks or joints in the concrete it would then enter the building. 
In some cases, waterproof concrete was used for these applications. However, there are 
many variables
 to ensuring that waterproof concrete performed optimally in these environments, and some architects and engineers had concerns about specifying this for more critical projects.
In the mid 1990s, introduced a fully bonded solution called the PREPRUFE® waterproofing membrane to address these limitations. Specifically engineered for below slab and behind confined walls, the PREPRUFE® waterproofing membrane bonds to the concrete that is cast against it. Its adhesive layer creates a tight seal between the concrete and the waterproofing membrane so that even if the membrane gets damaged, water is prevented from bypassing the membrane and migrating into the building.
For the first time, construction and waterproofing professionals could use different depending on whether the waterproofing needed to be pre-or post-(that is, depending on whether the waterproofing needed to be before or after the concrete was poured) and still have a strong adhesive bond to the foundation.
For critical applications where there is low tolerance for water leaks, using the PREPRUFE® waterproofing membrane with a tight adhesive bond to the concrete is a safest choice.

Knowledge: Insights into construction Balancing act: Ensuring good attic ventilation
Balancing act: Ensuring good attic ventilation
Share
October 22, 2018
Good attic ventilation is just one component of a wider strategy for reducing the chance of ice dams, as well as other moisture problems. Whether you’re building a residential or commercial structure, ventilation is especially important in situations where poor air sealing lets heat and moisture from inside the structure get into the attic in the winter.
Learn more about & SHIELD, another component in your wider ice dam reduction strategy
It's common for a contractor to add vent holes to an under-ventilated attic. While this is a good idea, ventilation equipment manufacturers say that this is not always done right. Just punching more holes in the space isn't good enough; the holes need to be in the right place.
You want a balance between intake and exhaust, but if that's not possible, then it's better to have more intake vents. surplus of intake vents will put the attic under slightly elevated air pressure, forcing air out the exhausts on the leeward side of the house.
Another common problem is airflow short-circuiting, which is caused by using different types of vents. For instance, if the attic has a ridge vent and roof louvers, then one will act as an intake and the other as an exhaust, leaving much of the attic essentially unventilated.
In an article in Roofing Contractor magazine, John Nessen of ventilation manufacturer Quarrix Building Products suggest three steps to correcting a short-circuited vent system. 
If the structure has ridge vents, seal all other exhaust vents.
If the structure has roof louvers, seal any gable vents.
If there's a power vent in the roof and you want to keep it, then eliminate all other exhaust vents.
Following these steps will help remove unwanted heat and moisture from the attic, providing uninterrupted airflow across the entire attic space.

Knowledge: Insights into construction Should specify smooth or granular roof underlayments?
Should specify smooth or granular roof underlayments?
Share
November 05, 2018
Peel-and-stick roof membranes with a granular surface first appeared in the 1990s after some contractors complained that the early versions of smooth-surface products were too slick to walk on and that their adhesives were too sticky. The granular roof membrane's sandpaper-like top surface was often marketed as a safety enhancement. The less aggressive adhesive, which could result in back-nailing requirements and other time-consuming steps in cool weather or when adhesion was marginal, was sometimes marketed as “repositionability”.
Smooth-surfaced membranes have sbeen re-engineered with slip-resistant surface coatings to alleviate this safety concern. Some contractors still stick with granular roof membranes due to their low cost. However, there are inherent compromises that come with the lower cost. The main drawbacks are the material's performance and the sandpapery surface itself.
First, overall thickness can be misleading when considering installed waterproofing performance. While granular roof membranes are as thick as 60 mils, their composition is similar to a roof shingle, with a layer of fiberglass material over a relatively thin layer of rubberized asphalt. In fact, the rubberized asphalt layer might only be 10-12 mils, compared to 36 mils for

. Thickness is an important consideration. However, it is not the only criteria. What is more important is the chemical formulation of the adhesive. As most roofing repair contractors have discovered, penetrations are one of the most common sources of leaks, so having the ability to seal around penetrations is critically important for minimizing risk and providing long-term protection. The chemical composition of the adhesive layer is a key consideration in this decision.

Second, a lapping membrane won’t adhere to a rough surface. Although there is a selvage, or non-granular strip at the top of the roll for the overlapping course, that still leaves the problem of how to lap strips end to end or anywhere that a cut has been made. Sealing that connection usually requires use of an asphalt roofing adhesive. This is fine – until all or part of the roof needs to be replaced. Often times, you can’t remove the old roofing materials from the granular surfaced membrane, and if you can, you cannot install a new layer of membrane over the old granular surfaced membrane. 
The best protection for sloped roofs is a fully-adhered smooth-surfaced membrane that bonds tightly to the substrate, seals well at overlaps and seals completely around nail penetrations. This type of protection is essential for critical areas such as valleys, edges and details such as eves.

© 2018The National Ready Mixed Concrete Association's (NRMCA) Sustainable Concrete Plant Certification (the "Certification") provides ready mix plant personnel specific guidance to assess their production practices and implement sustainability strategies that will ultimately lower their overall carbon footprint.
While any good ready mix plant must strive to turn a profit, they're now also tasked with a triple bottom line that addresses not only economic prosperity, but social equity and environmental responsibility.
The benefits seem obvious enough.
"Moving towards a sustainable, environmentally conscious production model not only reduces environmental burdens, but also increases efficiency and places ready mixed concrete plants in a position of industry leadership in the growing green movement," reads the NRCMA's Plant Certification webpage .
The webpage also provides downloads—helpful worksheets and a "Guidelines" 1—for plants to make strides toward sustainability. Plants are graded on a 100-point scale:
Bronze: 30-49 points
Silver: 50-69 points
Gold: 70-89 points
Platinum: 90-100 points
To earn points, plants are assessed by five criteria.
In this article, we'll address how a ready mix plant can earn points in four of these five categories, by incorporating an in-transit concrete management system into its truck fleet.
Material acquisition
Cement content is the most important factor in determining a concrete mix’s embodied energy and carbon footprint. Therefore, if a ready mix producer can reduce their cement use, they will minimize both costs and their CO2 emissions.
Along this vein, the suggests encouraging architects and engineers to specify 56-day strength rather than 28-day. Concrete mixes containing high volumes of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) such as fly ash, for example, will gain 50-80% of their ultimate strength after the 28-day mark and allow the producer to deliver a higher strength concrete with less cement.
In addition, the producer can avoid "overdesign," or adding extra cement to the mix by gaining tightened controls through an in-transit concrete management system. With these systems, water and/or admixture additions are automatically managed by the cloud-based system via sensors and an injection nozzle on each ready mix truck. The ready mix plant personnel doesn’t have to add extra cement or "overdesign" the mix. Without the cloud-based system, producers traditionally have had to incorporate as much as a 5% cement cushion to hedge against water additions that lessen strength while the wet concrete ships from the plant to the jobsite.
Production
For ready mix plants to truly become sustainable, they must assess their use of resources and consumption of energy throughout the entire production process.
When equipped with in-transit concrete management, a ready mix plant can greatly reduce the amount of water added during batching sthe automated system monitors, measures and manages water additions, among other things.
Typically, extra water is added in the batching process to compensate for slump loss that the wet concrete will endure in transit. Conversely, the in-transit concrete management system, which controls water additions automatically on the truck, allows ready mix personnel to batch the concrete on spec at the plant. If loads encounter slump loss while in-transit the system will inject precise water additions automatically to keep that slump within target. System water additions are also tracked and recorded in the cloud.
With this technology, ready mix producers can realistically monitor how much water they are using in transit. They can set benchmarks and then try to improve upon them over time.
Delivery and construction
According to the NRMCA's sustainability guidelines, "improving fleet operation and management through fuel economy, updated and properly maintained vehicles and well-trained drivers will minimize the environmental burdens incurred in the construction phase and streamline the construction process."
An in-transit concrete management system especially aids in improving fuel economy in two main areas: (1) reducing truck idle time; (2) reducing high-speed drum rotations in transit, which can account for up to 23% of a ready mix truck's fuel consumption.
The automated concrete management system reduces a ready mix truck's idle time because more trucks will arrive at the jobsite on slump target. Eliminating slump retests or re-tempering onsite leads to immediate pours and, thus, less onsite wait time. The in-transit concrete management system also records data such as average onsite wait time, cycle times and total time onsite so that ready mix producers can be sure they've shaved valuable minutes from each delivery.
The system also regulates high-speed drum rotations. Sthe truck-mounted sensors constantly monitor the quality of the concrete in transit, the system rotates the drum only as much as the concrete requires to remain within specification. Less drum rotations translate to less energy and less fuel consumed.
Material reuse and recycling
Excess concrete, in both plastic and hardened states, is a primary concern in the ready mix concrete industry. Think of the carbon footprint of one rejected load alone: This includes the truck fuel burnt to deliver and now return it, the wasted cement and other concrete components themselves and the added energy required to now crush and find some low-value alternative use for this rejected material. Return rates average around 5% of production volume, but have been reported as high as 15% in some cases.
The best way for ready mix producers to reduce this percentage is by avoiding rejected loads. An in-transit concrete management system like the VERIFI® in-transit concrete management system is a great tool by which to accomplish this. Sthe ready mix concrete is managed by the automated system, producers can be confident that more of their loads will arrive at the jobsite on slump, in spec and ready to pour immediately.

Knowledge: Insights into construction Making your foundation waterproofing project go smoother
Making your foundation waterproofing project go smoother
Share
October 01, 2018
The below grade waterproofing process often doesn’t get a lot of attention on major construction projects, but there can be major damage and costly delays if the waterproofing membrane isn’t installed correctly. These are some key points to consider to ensure the best performance from your waterproofing membrane – and to get the job done swiftly.
Is your waterproofing applicator trained in the products being installed?
Work with an experienced applicator who is educated by the manufacturer for the specific below grade waterproofing system. This will help ensure the integrity of the 
waterproofing membrane
 and keep the project running on schedule.
What is the substrate made of?
Confirm that the material the substrate is made of can accept the type of waterproofing membrane you plan to use. For example, some waterproofing products require a solid working slab to ensure confinement and others can use compacted earth. Ensuring the appropriate time and expense is budgeted based on the required substrate reduces surprises later in the process. 
How durable is the waterproofing membrane?
Your 
waterproofing system
 doesn’t just need to stand up to the elements. It needs to be durable enough to withstand typical foot traffic as work continues after the installation in addition to the weight of the reinforcing steel. To address this concern, choose a waterproofing system that accommodates these concerns and ensure that all trades are aware of the waterproofing system. Otherwise you could end up with delays if the membrane is damaged by excessive foot traffic or by accidental punctures.
Who is coordinating with other trades?
Ensure that installation of all mechanical, electrical, and plumbing that comes into contact with the waterproofing membrane or will penetrate the waterproofing membrane is coordinated with the waterproofing installer and is properly detailed. For example, utilities need to be installed, spaced, and secured carefully to avoid damage to the membrane. pre-construction meeting dedicated to the waterproofing, with all of the applicable trades present, will be critical to ensure that all parties are educated on the waterproofing system and working together to ensure a successful installation.
Are the various waterproofing systems on the project compatible with one another?
Be sure that the waterproofing systems work well together, and ideally are supplied by a single manufacturer so you can have confidence that the systems are compatible with one another and will be tied in together appropriately. Incompatible systems could end up being vulnerable points for water infiltration.
Do you have a waterproofing expert to call when changes arise in the field?
It’s not uncommon for site conditions to necessitate changes in materials or in the sequence of tasks. Be sure you have a waterproofing professional who can quickly provide guidance to ensure the continuity of the entire waterproofing system.

CONCERA® water reducing admixtures were designed to create high flow concrete that is easier to place and finish compared to conventional concrete, and less labor-intensive than self-consolidating concrete. Argos USA’s Kirk Deadrick recently spoke about the ways CONCERA® admixtures can benefit contractors. leading manufacturer and distributor of building products, Argos produces and markets cement and ready mix concrete throughout its operations in Colombia, the United States, Central America and the Caribbean.

                    "see CONCERA® [admixtures] helping the contractor from a labor perspective because it is easier to put together and they should be able to use less people. 
When we use self-consolidating concrete, we tend to need more people on the job site. With CONCERA® [admixtures], see that the mix is already set. We get the slump we want. 

If a finishing contractor has fewer issues and the concrete is more consistent and is easier to finish, then his final product is going to look better and will make the owner feel better about it."

Sardinia Concrete improves profitability with control flow concrete

With CONCERA® admixtures, ready mix producers can produce higher flowing concrete using conventional mix designs. Dubbed control flow concrete, this new category of concrete has slump flows that fall between those of conventional and self-consolidating concrete, but without the inherent costs of self-consolidating concrete.
The resulting concrete vastly reduces labor costs involved with moving and placing concrete. Control flow concrete can be used for a wide range of projects, such as horizontal slabs, elevated decks, as well as vertical walls and columns. 
Ohio-based ready mix producer Sardinia Concrete has used CONCERA® admixtures to produce control flow concrete for a large basement floor. For this project, using control flow concrete eliminated the need for a pump.

                    "CONCERA® [admixtures] made the project go faster…We put the [admixture] in and the concrete flowed across the entire basement floor. By doing that, it saved the owner a substantial amount of money, and put money back into my company’s pocket."
