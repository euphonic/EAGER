Supply Chain Servicesindustries is a premier distributor of Electronic Components and Fasteners used for production in Aerospace, Communication, Computer, Fabrication, Industrial Equipment, Instrumentation, Marine and Military Industries. We strive to be our customers' sole supplier of electronic components and fasteners by being a local presence, providing exceptional service and offering one-stop-shopping.
In addition to having a broad line we provide unsurpassed customer service.

That is why every inquiry will be directed to a trained sales professional knowledgeable in a specific category, who will be able to quote, give feedback or reference an alternative item within four hours. Our excellence in inventory management enables us to pass down cost savings to our customers. Product managers constantly analyze our stock and usage trends to ensure that we have the parts our customers need in stock, shortening lead times and improving costs.Select Language:
