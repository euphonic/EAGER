We Are Inc.
At LKI, we’ve been creating toys that make smile, and work like magic for over 25 years!

Our mission is to make quality toys at affordable prices                     – so your family can enjoy them across generations.
Why choose LKI?
Play time is essential to children’s growth in so many areas, such as physical, sensory, social, and intellectual development. Play gives                     the opportunity to experiment and try out all the things they are learning in their day to day lives, as well as develop new skills.                     Playing allows children to learn by doing and allows them to directly experience the real world around them. Our toys are designed                     to help learn through play!
