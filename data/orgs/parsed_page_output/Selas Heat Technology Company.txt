Selas, a worldwide manufacturer with facilities in the United States, Germany and Japan, was purchased in 2005 by Lionheart Industrial Group. Backed by strong financial resources, solid leadership and a continuing commitment to designing the very best burners and components, has been repositioned to deliver a comprehensive line of combustion products and excellent customer support.
Soon after acquiring Selas, the Lionheart team began searching for complementary technologies to provide a more well-rounded suite of products to offer its customers. The first acquisition was Pyronics, a well-respected manufacturer of pre-mix and nozzle-mix burners, combustion controls and accessories. In 2012 and 2013, the Red-Ray infrared line and the Ensign ribbon burner products were added to the growing family. And, in 2013, Webster Combustion, a leader in commercial boiler burners, was acquired.
