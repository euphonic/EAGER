Innovating the Aging Experience
Calling all Canadian businesses
MISSISSAUGA, Canada – June 1, 2018 –Canada’s seniors are not afraid of innovation and want the private sector to develop products and services that improve the aging experience, empower their independence and provide more choice. That is what The Report on Innovation and the Aging Experience discovered.

“With the growing aging population in Canada, what we’re finding is that more and more seniors are taking an active approach to defining what they want. This represents a tremendous opportunity for Canadian businesses that choose to focus on innovations for the senior market,” says Thomas Wellner, President & of Revera.
Report
 highlights that market and other researchers tend to overlook the diversity within the senior population. Often, anyone over the age of 65 is categorized as a single group from a market perspective. With Canadians living well into their 80s and 90s, recommends companies rethink how they view the senior market given that a person who is 85-years-old has different wants and needs than someone in their early 70s.

“There’s a tremendous opportunity for companies and startups to take another look at the senior population and come up with innovative solutions to older adults’ concerns about health or losing their independence,” says Trish Barbato, Revera’s Senior Innovation and Strategic Partnerships. “It’s really an exciting sector to be working in.”

conducted a national survey of Canadian seniors and held consultations with its residents across Canada to learn more about how innovation impacts the aging experience. Eighty-seven per cent of respondents agreed innovation would help solve many worries they have about aging, and 84 per cent said the private sector can do more to improve the aging experience.

Seniors are actively seeking products and services that support independence and choice, but there is a gap in what is available to them given innovation efforts are rarely focused on improving the aging experience. The Report on Innovation and the Aging Experience points out that companies that embrace this key demographic have a big opportunity as the Canadian population continues to age and has more wealth than ever before.
Recommendations

The report offers three recommendations for Canadian companies ready to embrace innovation focused on seniors. First, recognize that seniors are a diverse segment and not a single demographic group. Second, adapt current product lines and services to reach the growing senior market. Finally, embrace the opportunity to develop new innovative products and services for older adults who are eager to remain independent as they age.
Survey highlights include:

The Report on Innovation and the Aging Experience identifies that 87 per cent of Canadian seniors agree that innovation would help make them more comfortable with aging

Older adults are not afraid of innovations and are actively looking for products and services that will allow them to live more independently and have more choice as they age.

There is a tremendous business opportunity for Canadian companies to work with and design new innovative products for a segment of the population that is growing, that has wealth, and yet is often overlooked.
Methodology:

held consultations with seniors at 10 of its Retirement Residences and Long Term Care Homes across Canada between December 2017 and February 2018. national poll was also conducted on behalf of by Leger. An online survey of 1099 Canadians aged 65 and older was completed between April 27 to April 30, 2018. The margin of error for this study was +/-3.0% 19 times out of 20.

“Our government is committed to supporting Ontario residents who rely on long-term care homes for their ongoing health and personal care needs. By adding 128 new long-care beds to the redevelopment of Baywoods Place in Hamilton, we are helping more seniors access the care they need in their community, close to family and friends,” said Hon. Dr. Helena Jaczek, Minister of Health and Long-Term Care.

The addition of 128 beds and the development of a new Baywoods long-term care facility will provide Hamilton seniors and their families with increased access to the care they need,” said Fred Eisenberger, Mayor of Hamilton. “Increased access to long-term care beds will also ultimately take pressure off our hospitals and emergency departments.”

Statement Regarding 50 New Long Term Care Beds for London
is proud to be a leader in the move towards redeveloping older long term care homes. We are pleased with today’s announcement by the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care. The allocation of 50 Long Term Care bed licenses, in addition to the existing 78 beds for Elmwood Place, whose license will expire in 2020 if not redeveloped, will allow us to develop a modern, purpose-built home that meets the needs of future generations of seniors.

has worked closely with the Ministry of Health and Long Term Care over the past year and a half to chart a path forward for our 33 Ontario long term care homes in need of development, with specific focus on the homes with licenses expiring in 2020.

We share the Ministry’s belief that the redevelopment of older long term care homes is urgently needed and is the right thing to do. Modernizing to the newest design standards will help us create the right environment to meet the increasingly complex health needs of residents, many of whom are living with multiple chronic conditions, often including Alzheimer’s disease or other dementias.

In addition to caring for seniors living in long term care homes, is committed to the people and communities we serve and to improving the aging experience.
We are the only senior living company in Canada that has a Chief Elder Officer. Our “other” CEO, Hazel McCallion, meets regularly with our residents to discuss their experience in our homes and we take action to improve our operations based on this dialogue.
We are the only company in our sector in Canada that has a Chief Medical Officer. Our new CMO, Dr. Rhonda Collins, works directly with the Clinical and Quality leads in our Long Term Care homes to enhance our offering and our residents’ experience.
We are committed to driving senior-focused innovation to improve the aging experience. We have a $20 million Innovators in Aging Fund through which we are helping to accelerate development of the most promising products, services and technologies and get them to the seniors who need them most.
We have two Resident Innovation Ambassadors who share their perspective on living in our communities and help us identify where innovation is needed, so we can focus our innovation efforts and investments on what matters most to the seniors we serve.
We are active advocates against Ageism, the most socially-acceptable form of discrimination.

We think of the residents who live with us today, and those of the future, when we contemplate the urgent need to redevelop. We are pleased that we now have a path forward in London, and look forward to working with the Government of Ontario to identify solutions for other long term care homes where we have licenses expiring in the short and medium term.

- January 25, 2018 – Inc. and WinterLight Labs today demonstrated a new speech-assessment technology that is funded by Ontario’s 
Health Technologies Fund
 (HTF). 
received funding
 in the first round of Ontario’s $20-million The fund is administered by 
Ontario Centres of Excellence
 (OCE) on behalf of the 
Office of the Chief Health Innovation Strategist
 (OCHIS), and is a part of the mandate to strengthen Ontario’s health innovation ecosystem.

“The Health Technologies Fund is already having an impact in the health system because of the collaborations it has created between health service providers, health technology innovators and patients,” says William Charnetski, Ontario’s Chief Health Innovation Strategist. “We are finding new ways to solve our greatest challenges by harnessing the power of innovation to provide better care while creating jobs in Ontario.”

Representatives from OCHIS, OCE, and WinterLight Labs were on location at Leaside Retirement Residence for a presentation that included highlights of the Health Innovation Teams’ progress to date.
WinterLight Labs
 (winterlightlabs.com) has developed a tablet-based speech-assessment technology that detects and monitors cognitive impairment. The technology can identify Alzheimer's disease, aphasia (language impairment, often related to stroke or other brain injury), and Parkinson's disease with high accuracy.

Regular use of the technology can reassure families that elderly relatives are still able to live independently, with quantifiable updates and the ability to plan ahead.

“These digital health projects demonstrate why investment through the Health Technologies Fund is so important. People are more comfortable than ever using digital technology in their everyday lives and they expect the same kind of interaction with their health system,” says Eric Hoskins, Minister of Health and Long-Term Care. “With these new tools, health care will become even faster and simpler for patients to use in their homes and communities.”

With a proven track record of delivering programs on behalf of the Ontario government, was selected to deliver the and assist in driving the development of made-in-Ontario healthcare technology while supporting economic growth, co-investing to commercialize innovation and fostering partnerships and collaboration in the health system.

“Healthcare is a priority sector in Ontario and globally, so it makes sense that works with publicly-funded healthcare service providers, patients, academia, and industry to find innovative ways to improve patient outcomes and experience by supporting the demonstration of health tech through the Health Technologies Fund,” says Dr. Tom Corr, OCE’s President and CEO.

“is committed to providing the best possible care for our residents. Often changes in cognition go unnoticed during the early stages. The innovative speech-assessment software we are piloting with WinterLight Labs will greatly enhance our ability to identify cognitive changes early in the process and ensure that we have the appropriate resources in place to ensure the best care is being provided,” said Dr. Rhonda Collins, Revera’s Chief Medical Officer.

“Innovation is critical in our health system and we are so pleased to work collaboratively with our partners to support WinterLight Labs, part of our Innovators in Aging program, to be successful,” said Trish Barbato, Senior Vice President, Innovation and Strategic Partnerships, Inc.

“Existing methods for tracking cognitive status are time consuming and provoke anxiety. WinterLight is excited to be partnering with an innovative company like to pilot this quick and stress-free technology for monitoring cognition. Providing an early-warning system for Alzheimer’s disease will help seniors live independently longer,” said Liam Kaufman, & Cofounder, WinterLight Labs.
