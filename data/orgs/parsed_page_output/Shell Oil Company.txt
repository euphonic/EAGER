About Us
Diversity and Inclusion
Diversity and Inclusion
At Shell, working to promote inclusion is not merely a human resources initiative. It is at the very core of how we do business.
We believe that only through many points of view comes true wisdom. And it is the wisdom of many that will be most definitely needed to solve the energy challenges we face today and into the future.
Workforce Diversity
One Shell, many faces.
Finding innovative and responsible ways to secure the world’s future supply of energy can’t be done by few. It’s a monumental undertaking, and it’s going to require the input, knowledge and creativity of people around the planet.
This is why we don’t look at inclusion as an act of corporate goodwill. We don’t see it simply as “the right thing to do.” To Shell, having a diverse workforce is the only way we can accomplish our greatest objectives. Yet, even more importantly, we see it as a matter of global necessity.
The energy challenges we face are enormous – and we’re endeavoring to put the best minds in the world to work on developing the solutions.
At Shell, we have come to affectionately embrace our differences. We rely on diverse perspectives in order to make progress that has the world’s best interests at heart. Through active recruitment efforts we are succeeding in creating an ever more diverse workplace.
But to us that is not the goal, only the result of our approach. The true mark of our success is that inclusion has become embedded in everything we do as a company. It is beginning to define us.
It is securing the future of our company, no doubt. But we also feel that in some ways we are helping to secure the future of society itself. And we believe that is a worthy step in the right direction.
Outreach
Progress is a community effort.
The entire world runs on energy. So it only makes sense to reach out to the world in ways that make real meaningful connections. And we can only do this by having a diverse workforce of individuals naturally acting as our global emissaries.
We constantly connect with our communities from the level all the way to the volunteerism of our individual employees. We have and support several community organizations that work to improve opportunities for women, people of color, people with disabilities and others.
leaders regularly serve on the boards of nonprofit associations. We have built close working relationships with organizations such as the National Urban League and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.
We have found that their goals are intertwined with our own. Working together to create opportunities for a diverse range of people surely strengthens our communities, which in turn strengthens our company.
Our outreach efforts also go beyond what can be done today, and start moving toward what should be done for tomorrow. Solving our future energy challenges is going to require the emergence of brilliant thinkers in the fields of math, science and technology.
We can’t afford to just hope that this will happen, so we’re taking action to steer young people down these paths now and eventually increase the talent pool for the entire industry. We are making a significant investment in education, primarily in urban schools from elementary to the college level.
We have initiated a number of programs, including math and science camps and competitions, career fairs, teacher development, scholarships and internships. All this to get students excited about obtaining the knowledge they will need to be the pioneers of energy’s future.
Employee Networks
team approach
An atmosphere of inclusion cannot be achieved through a corporate directive. It takes real culture change. And we believe is progressing in this every day. We are creating an environment that is open to new ideas, where people are comfortable speaking up and challenging the norm.
This culture of acceptance, self-assurance and mutual respect has led to the formation of several employee networks within Shell. These company-supported networks were first created to advance the best interests and foster the career development of specific groups, such as African American, Asian, LGBT, Hispanic, women employees as well as new graduates and experienced hires.
Yet they have evolved far beyond an internal focus to having great impact on helping accomplish its business goals. In fact, each group must have an approved business plan in place before its annual budget is approved.
These highly accountable networks are extremely valuable to our company. Through new employee orientation assistance, mentoring and formal talent-management programs, our networks actively enhance Shell’s recruiting and retention efforts.
Through charity and business event participation, they help us connect with our surrounding communities. They also give us valuable insight on emerging and niche markets, and provide unique perspective on ways to build our revenue and boost our success.
One might think that having network groups separated by designations such as race, gender and lifestyle would contradict a culture of inclusiveness. On the contrary, having collective special interests represented helps us get very focused on the most important diversity issues, and guides us on taking concrete actions that have a chance to make a real difference.

In 2016, and Penske Corporation look to celebrate their on-going alliance in North America with a number of key milestones and continued successes, on and off the race track.
The alliance, which was forged in 2011, features and Pennzsponsorship of Team Penske entries in the Sprint Cup Series and the Verizon IndyCar Series. In addition, and Pennzcontinue to be the preferred supplier of fuels, lubricants and related products to the entire Penske organization.
For Team Penske, 2016 will be a significant year as they celebrate their 50th anniversary in motorsports. The team waved the green flag on the commemorative activities by displaying an exhibit at the Hall of Fame in Charlotte, in late January with a similar display to debut in mid-February at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum. Each display will showcase cars spanning multiple racing disciplines from 1966 to present. Cars owned and prepared by Team Penske have produced 424 major race wins, 487 pole positions, and 28 national championships in the half-decade.
2015 was a phenomenally successful year on the track for the Shell-supported teams in the Sprint Cup Series and Verizon IndyCar Series.
number of key victories including two of the biggest, the Daytona 500 and the Indianapolis 500, highlighted a year where teams in each series had dominant runs and championship aspirations.
In NASCAR, Joey Logano (No. 22 Shell-PennzFord Fusion) further established himself to be an annual championship contender by scoring a series-high six victories including the biggest race of the year – the Daytona 500. Logano found himself atop the standings most of the season while earning career-best numbers in nearly every statistical category. He was no longer considered a tough competitor and occasional race winner, but was now one of the sport’s true stars and a force to be reckoned with.
Helio Castroneves and team, Indianapolis, IN, - May 10-21, 2015; Indianapolis 500 practice and qualifications
In the Verizon IndyCar Series, Team Penske captured their 16th Indianapolis 500 victory when Juan Pablo Montoya held off teammate Will Power for his second career win in one of the most prestigious races in the world.
Montoya lost the 2015 IndyCar Series title in a heart-breaking tiebreaker at the end of the season after finishing tied in points with another driver.
Three-time Indianapolis 500 champion, Helio Castroneves, carried the V-Power NiTRO+ Premium Gasoline colors for in two IndyCar races last year, and with another successful season in 2015, moved even higher among the ranking greats in IndyCar history.
Helio ranks fourth all-time in pole positions won with 45, is tied for 11th in wins, and second with 38 second-place finishes in the series. Castroneves will carry the famous Pennz“Yellow Submarine” colors on his No. 3 Chevrolet in the 100th running of the Indy500 this year. With a win, Castroneves would join an elite group of only three other drivers to visit victory lane four times at the famous Brickyard in The Greatest Spectacle in Racing.
In 2014, Pennzintroduced PennzPlatinum® Full Synthetic motor oils with PurePlus™ Technology, fully synthetic motor oils formulated from natural gas. PennzPlatinum Full Synthetic motor with PurePlus™ Technology 0W-40 motor is the exact same that Team Penske and all other Chevrolet race teams in the Verizon IndyCar Series use right-out-of-the-bottle in all of their V6 powered race cars.
and Pennzwill also be associate sponsors on all Team Penske cars competing throughout the 2016 season in the Sprint Cup, Xfinity Series and Verizon IndyCar Series.
The Team Penske relationship is an extension of the and Pennzracing legacy. Pennzfirst aligned with Team Penske as part of its IndyCar teams in 1983 and won two Indianapolis 500-mile races (1984 & 1988) with driver Rick Mears.

About Pipeline
Although pipeline leaks are uncommon, they present a potential risk. If you suspect a pipeline has been damaged and might be leaking, you can help protect people, environment and property in your community by reporting it immediately. Call 911 and then your local one call center because even seemingly insignificant damage, such as a scrape or dent, could damage a pipeline’s protective coating and eventually lead to a leak or safety incident if it is not repaired.

About Pipeline LP
95 Years of Meeting America's Needs
Pipeline has helped meet America’s energy needs for 95 years as we trace the beginnings of in the pipeline business back to 1919 through the acquisition of Yarhola Pipe Line Company, later renamed Ozark Pipe Line Company.
We are a proud operator focused on reliability, pipeline integrity, and service to our customers.  We currently own and operate 7 tank farms across the U.S., and transport more than 1.5 billion barrels of crude and refined products annually through 3800 pipeline miles across the Gulf of Mexico and 5 states.  Our various non-operated ownership interests add an additional 8000 pipeline miles to our portfolio unlocking multiple interfaces to share best-practices with other pipeline operators.
We carry more than 40 different kinds of crude and more than 20 different grades of gasoline, as well as diesel fuel, jet fuel, chemicals, and ethylene – products that are fundamental to the American way of life.
Brochures for more information about Pipeline and pipeline safety
For more information about Pipeline and pipeline safety, download our brochures. The Baseline and Enhanced brochures provide information to further your awareness and knowledge about our pipeline operations in your community.

Protecting the Integrity of Our 
Assets
Protecting Pipelines
At Pipeline Company, we take steps to preserve the integrity of our pipelines, storage tanks and facilities to help keep them safe, reliable and environmentally sound.
We conduct risk and integrity assessments by performing scheduled inspections and integrating data from numerous sources.
Using sophisticated computer and telecommunications equipment located along our pipeline system, we monitor our pipelines from our control centers 24 hours a day, seven days a week. If a problem is detected, we take quick action to correct it.
We conduct frequent ground or aerial surveys along our pipeline routes, looking for any excavation activity or ground discoloration that could indicate a leak.
We also periodically reassess our maintenance and damage prevention activities, looking for opportunities to improve them.
Pipeline Transportation
Interstate pipelines deliver over 12.9 billion barrels (542 billion gallons) of petroleum products each year.
About 59% of the petroleum products transported by pipelines is crude (7.6 billion barrels) and the remainder (5.3 billion barrels) is in the form of refined petroleum products.* 
Crude is a raw material for making petroleum products.
Crude pipelines transport crude from onshore and offshore production wells and from coastal shipping terminals to refineries and chemical plants. At refineries, the is processed into refined products such as gasoline, heating fuel, diesel and feed stocks.  At chemical plants, the feed stocks are processed into resins, plastics, chemicals and agricultural products. These base products are then manufactured into hundreds of products used in and around your home.
The Second Part of the Journey
Pipelines also handle the second part of the transportation journey--transporting the refined products to regional and local distribution centers. At the distribution centers, the products are loaded on to tanker trucks for further transportation to airports, service stations and to your home.

Appalachia - Pennsylvania
Appalachia - Pennsylvania
Shell’s Appalachia operations are located in the predominately rural northern and western portions of Pennsylvania, where we drill and produce dry gas from the Marcellus and Utica formations. entered the area in 2010 after acquiring 750,000 leasehold acres from East Resources. We have since grown our acreage leasehold to approximately 850,000 acres primarily in Pennsylvania, with additional acreage in Ohio and New York.
Appalachia Fact Sheet
Operations
We are one of the largest leaseholders and producers over a nine-county area in the Appalachia Basin. Our Appalachian asset is divided into three focus areas: Tioga, Mercer and Bradford. We operate over 300 dry gas wells, predominately in Tioga County and 1,500 shallow wells mainly in the Bradford area.
In 2014 and 2015, discovered that the Utica/Point Pleasant shale was also very prolific. We plan to drill additional wells in 2016, mainly in the Utica acreage.
As part of our Operating Principles, we strive to conduct our operations in a manner that protects air quality and controls fugitive emissions. In Appalachia, we have taken a number of voluntary measures to reduce methane emissions, including the installation of the latest air-emissions reduction technology on 90% of our surface facilities.
is also a founding member of the Center for Sustainable Shale Development (CSSD), an independent organization that developed 15 performance standards, in conjunction with non-governmental organizations and nonprofits, to address air and water concerns. Appalachia was certified in early 2015 for meeting all of the performance standards. 
Contact Us
For questions or concerns about the Appalachia operations area, call 570-662-9415.
For issues in Tioga, Lycoming, Bradford and Potter counties, please call our Community Feedback Line at 570-662-9415.
Community
supports a wide range of social investment programs in the Appalachia area. In 2015, we spent more than $637,000 on community, environmental and educational initiatives. These initiatives promote science, technology, engineering and math education to help develop students to meet future workforce needs through the Tioga County Foundation. is also a major sponsor of the Pennsylvania Envirothon, an academic competition designed to cultivate a desire in students to learn more about our natural environment. As a proponent of health and safety, we also have partnered with local first responders to provide training and equipment and have supported road safety initiatives.
Public Awareness 
What are pipeline markers? Why are they located where they are?
Pipeline markers provide useful information concerning nearby pipelines.
These markers or signs indicate the approximate – not the exact - location of the pipelines, which may or may not run in a straight line between any two markers. As a result, they cannot be relied on to provide information on pipeline location. You can obtain information about Shell’s pipelines by calling 1-800-922-3459.
It is against the law to willfully and knowingly deface, damage, remove or destroy any pipeline sign or right-of-way post.
Who do call to locate Shell’s pipeline or facilities on my property?
State law requires you to call 811 (the National “Call Before You Dig” number) or your local One-Call Center at least 48 hours, excluding weekends and holidays, before you begin any digging project, large or small, within a pipeline easement area; some states require 72 hours notice. The One-Call Center will notify the companies responsible for locating the facilities within their area.
Why should call 811 before every dig?
It’s the law - and it's the smart thing to do. Whether you're a homeowner or a professional excavator, you are required to call 811 before you dig.
Knowing where underground utility lines are buried before you dig will help protect you from injury and prevent damages to utilities, service disruptions and possibly even fines and repair costs. Whether you're planting a tree or shrub or installing a deck or pool, every job requires a call, even if you've called before for a similar project.
I've called my local "Call Before You Dig" number before. Will 811 replace this service?
No, 811 will not replace your local One-Call number. The national number was put in place to enhance and improve the one-call process. With more than 62 local One-Call numbers across the country, 811 eliminates the confusion about what number to call in your area.
How far in advance do need to call?
State laws vary from 48 to 72 hours, most excluding weekends and legal holidays. Call 811 directly, and the customer service representative will provide specific information.
Do the colors of the paint and flags indicate anything in particular?
Yes. The colors indicate what type of underground facility is buried belowground.
Red – electric
Orange – communications, telephone/CATV
Blue – potable water
Green – sewer/drainage
Yellow –  gas/petroleum pipeline
Purple – reclaimed water
Pink – temporary survey marker
White – pre-marked site of intended excavation
How often does monitor its pipelines?
adheres to strict federal laws that require pipeline operators to continuously monitor and maintain pipeline segments in areas where the consequences of their failure could be significant.
We monitor our entire pipeline network from our control center 24 hours a day, seven days a week, using computer and telecommunications equipment located across the system. These centers continuously monitor flow, pressure and other data that indicate the condition of the pipeline system.
Does inspect its pipelines?
Yes. As part of our comprehensive safety program, we inspect and test our pipeline systems regularly.
We monitor pipelines by air and/or ground to identify and prevent any unauthorized activity.
We inspect pipeline rights-of-way for unusual changes in vegetation that might indicate a leak.
We test, inspect and monitor the cathodic protection system on our pipelines that helps prevent corrosion.
We use various tools and technologies to help ensure that our pipelines are sound and fit for purpose.
We inspect and test valves on the pipelines.
When pipe is exposed for any reason, we inspect the condition of the pipe and its coatings and, if necessary, make repairs.

Modernization Project
has a track record of delivering novel technology solutions and supporting large-scale, complex projects in some of the world’s most challenging locations to help meet rising energy demand. To continue advancing the development and deployment of vital innovation and technology, underwent extensive expansion and renovation, completed in 2012.
The modernization project, which added 150,000 square feet and improved two-thirds of the existing space with major renovations, brought together upstream research and technology from the Bellaire Technology Center and downstream research and development and engineering support from the Westhollow Technology Center to create the Technology Center Houston.
Creative Thinking Drives Innovation
STCH’s expansive complex combines upstream and downstream technology groups to create unique synergies in the search for technologies to meet future energy demand. Innovations can come to fruition more effectively here, where the focus is on encouraging different ways of thinking, perceiving and working together in order to effectively communicate, exchange knowledge and combine disciplines to drive innovation.
Sustainable Design
The modernization improves energy efficiency, reduces energy consumption by approximately $2.0 million a year and reduces environmental impact through Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Certification. Improvements generate a 30% reduction in CO2 emissions and a significant reduction in chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Consolidation to one site also significantly reduces the environmental footprint.
At the Heart of the Community
gives back to the greater Houston community. and its employees support programs that not only help society thrive today, but also meet the needs of tomorrow through two primary types of initiatives. One is designed to grow innovative minds and build a strong workforce through education.

Supplier Diversity
About Supplier Diversity and U.S.
About Supplier Diversity and U.S.
Supplier diversity is a business program that encourages the use of: minority-owned, woman-owned, veteran-owned, LGBT-owned, service disabled veteran-owned, historically underutilized business (HUBs), and defined small business enterprises (SBEs) as suppliers. 
What is Supplier Diversity?
What Does Supplier Diversity Mean at Shell? 
For Shell, Supplier Diversity means working to make the profile of our supply chain reflect the profile of the communities in which we live and work, and encouraging these businesses to grow into the kind of suppliers will need to meet the energy needs of the future. Our energy goals for the future require the best resources we can gather from a broad spectrum of innovative, service-oriented businesses. Many of these businesses are owned by members of minority groups and by women.  
“firmly believes in getting involved in the communities where we live and work. That means rolling up our sleeves and doing what it takes to improve the lives of others through our volunteer efforts, financial support and the strong partnerships we foster with organizations and individuals throughout the community.”
Marvin Odum, President of Priority
Note from Debra Clark Stewart, Director, Supplier Diversity, Workforce Development and Community Outreach
Creating a diverse supply chain has been a priority at since the earliest days of corporate supplier diversity. The energy industry, as a major force in our economy, must continually challenge itself to stay on the cutting edge - creating dynamic new approaches that actually result in real opportunities and a higher level of diversity success. has accepted the challenge and our new diversity strategy is 100% focused on results.
 The energy industry, and corporations overall, must improve at helping suppliers find their fit within the supply chain:
When we work with suppliers who meet our criteria, we must be more proactive, more focused on opportunities that really exist and helping suppliers navigate the procurement process.
We must be more clear and direct about our priorities and real opportunities so suppliers can decide where to focus their energy and resources.
We must take a more integrated approach with our prime suppliers to make sure we are on the same page in terms of working with diverse suppliers.
We need to have a stronger capacity building approach and structure it as a long term investment, helping smaller M/WBEs find the resources and giving them time to grow into substantial suppliers.
We will be more focused on transparency and accountability for us and all our partners, prime suppliers and M/WBEs.
We will support our prime suppliers in achieving accountability and transparency in working toward their diversity goals.
We support and challenge our advocacy partners to work with more collaboration to create approaches across organizations that help small, minority and woman-owned businesses succeed.
We need M/WBEs to become laser focused on finding their fit. While we will be constantly refreshing our resources to help them with that search, we will expect them to be self-directed and diligent in creating and articulating value for Shell.
It is something of a paradigm shift, moving away from a more traditional supplier diversity model into a more proactive, transparent, and frankly, demanding approach. This website will be a primary outlet for information and tools to keep us all on the same path. We know we're asking a lot of all the players. is up to the challenge. Are you?
Best regards,
 Debra Clark Stewart

The innovative showdown teaches students about using team work to solve science challenges. It gives teachers and parents practical information on careers at and in the in the energy industry.
The showdown, held on the campus of the University of New Orleans, gave students from five Louisiana schools the chance to dream big about careers in energy.

Students from Eleanor McMain High School, Hammond High Magnet School, McDonogh 35 College Preparatory, Scotlandville Magnet High School and St. Joseph’s Academy built a working model crane from PVC, then used math skills to send a programmable robot through a complex maze.
During each competition, students learned the value of working together to solve complex problems. The College Captains learned project management skills, something they will soon use working in science.
St. Joseph’s Academy was the top winner and was awarded a $3,500 grant from to develop or enhance a Club. Runner up Hammond High Magnet School received a $1,500 grant to do the same. These clubs are another way is supporting its commitment to education and the community.
special session held for teachers and parents gave insights into education and available careers. Teachers learned new ways to make science interesting, and parents learned how to support and encourage students to study careers.

Global And Local Companies Offer Expertise to More Than 1,000 Students Competing For Energy-Efficiency Crown At Sonoma Raceway and Sponsor Free Activities for Visitors
Houston, April 12, 2018 – has enlisted 11 strategic partners for next week’s Make the Future California Festival and Eco-marathon Americas student competition at Sonoma Raceway. The event, which will be held on April 19-22, 2018, is expected to draw more than 1,000 student participants from 99 high schools and universities across the Americas. The event is free and open to the public to see and experience innovative solutions for more and cleaner forms of energy.
Eco-marathon is a unique and challenging competition featuring student-designed and built, ultra-energy-efficient vehicles. Visitors can experience a tour of the paddock area, where bright young students prepare their vehicles to see who can go the farthest on the least amount of energy, with some achieving more than 3,500 miles per gallon. Other activities popular with Festival-goers include free virtual reality experiences, hands-on science experiments and a hydrogen and electric vehicle ride and drive.
The Eco-marathon Americas competition features teams from Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru and the United States. Shell’s Festival and Technical partners, many of whom actively use the event as a recruitment ground, include: Agility, Altair, Delta, Honda, HP, Linde, O’Reilly, Toyota, Sonoma Raceway, Southwest Research Institute (SwRI), and United Airlines.  
2018 marks the 12th edition of Eco-marathon in the Americas and the return to California where the inaugural Eco-marathon Americas student challenge took place in 2007 with less than 25 teams competing on the inside track of the California Speedway in Fontana.
“At Shell, we find some of the best ideas come from working together, and that’s why the Make the Future Festival exists – to drive conversation, collaboration and innovation around cleaner, smarter energy solutions,” said Pamela Rosen, general manager for Eco-marathon Americas. “Our partners are the backbone of the Make the Future Festival, and their incredible support and shared purpose will ensure that Make the Future California is a rewarding and inspiring event for the Eco-marathon student participants and visitors who attend.”
Held for the first time at Sonoma Raceway, this year’s event includes several exciting elements for visitors, made possible by Shell’s dedicated partners. In addition, many of these partners will be participating in the “Meet the Expert” activation, during which they will serve as a knowledgeable resource to answer questions and share expertise on their respective focuses.

Make the Future Festivals is Shell's global platform for conversation, collaboration and innovation around the world's energy challenges. With events hosted in countries around the globe, they aim to provide an opportunity for multiple stakeholders: including students, entrepreneurs, businesses, governments and the public, to experience, test and contribute bright energy ideas.
About Eco-marathon
Eco-marathon is a global program built to offer students hands-on opportunities to develop ideas and technology, knowledge and skills, within an arena of competition.
Currently held in Asia, the Americas and Europe and made up of two key competitions: Eco-marathon Mileage Challenge, and Drivers' World Championship, students from countries across their respective regions use innovative problem-solving skills to design and build their own cars. Looking at every aspect of design and technology, students compete to prove that their bright ideas will produce the most energy-efficient vehicle when tested on the track.
Eco-marathon began in 1939 at a research laboratory in the United States as a friendly wager between scientists to see who could get the most miles per gallon from their vehicle. In 1985 in France, Eco-marathon as we know it today was born. In April 2007, the Eco-marathon Americas event was launched in the United States, and in 2010, the inaugural Eco-marathon Asia was held in Malaysia, up until 2013. In 2018, Eco-marathon Mileage Challenge and Drivers' World Championship competitions will be held in Singapore, California and London, with London hosting the Drivers' World Championship Grand Final.

Why does my monthly payment amount vary?
Many factors may cause your payment to vary, including but not limited to market conditions, suspended payments, adjustments (including any overpayments or underpayments), fluctuating commodity prices, regulatory or contractual changes, production volumes, seasonal conditions and routine maintenance or operating issues which may affect the volumes produced from a well during a given time period.
Why does my payment differ from others in my family?
This can occur because ownership between family members may not be equal. Family members may be on a different payment schedule. This may occur because one party has not provided with required information (i.e. missing tax information) or some family members may own interest in other properties in addition to those commonly owned. Other factors possibly causing variances between family member check amounts may be related to stale dated checks, returned checks and/or address changes.
What should do if do not receive my revenue check?
Due to potential postal delays, a revenue check may arrive a few days late on occasion. If you have not received a check by the 10th business day following the date of the check, please contact Lease Owner Relations. You may also sign up for Direct Deposit (EFT) to eliminate these kinds of delays.

Louisiana’s first Oyster Recycling Program
Louisiana’s first Oyster Recycling Program
2015-11-20
employees volunteer to help shape a sustainable energy future in Louisiana.
On November 20th, 27 volunteers from and Dickie Brennan and Co. traveled to Buras, LA, to start bagging the more than 1,300 tons of oyster collected as part of the Coalition to Restore Coastal Louisiana’s Oyster Recycling Program.  The bagged oyster will be used to build a half mile long reef in the Biloxi Marsh during the spring or summer of 2016. 
“Louisiana produces roughly one third of the nation’s oysters, but currently 60% of the oyster removed is not returning to coastal waters,” said Jimmy Frederick, Communications Director for “The Biloxi marsh is a high energy area, meaning that wave action causes a tremendous amount coastal erosion. Creating this oyster reef will help lessen the damage caused by the waves, help mitigate storm surge and provide a good environment for baby oysters to attach and grow.”
-Jimmy Frederick, Communications Director for CRCL
donated $1 million to the in 2013 to help launch and support Louisiana’s first Oyster Recycling Program as part of the Social Investment strategy for the Mars project. 
“When developing Mars B, we were looking for opportunities to give back to Louisiana and the communities where we operate in a meaningful way and the Oyster Recycling program was a natural fit,” said Rick Tallant, Asset Manager for the Gulf of Mexico East, “It's wonderful to see the success of this program and am thrilled that employees are out there volunteering to help shape a sustainable energy future for Louisiana alongside our great partners from Dickie Brennan and Co. and the CRCL”. 
25 restaurants in the Greater New Orleans Area participate in the program and, after one year of collecting oyster shell, it has become the largest oyster recycling program in the United States. 
“knew this program would be successful. But what didn’t know was that right out of the gate it would become the largest oyster recycling program in the country, “ said Dickie Brennan, Managing Partner of Dickie Brennan & Co. “It’s great to be a part of it.”
Participating restaurants separate the used from other waste and put them in purple bins that are collected and taken to Buras, LA, to cure for roughly 6 months before being used to build a new reef. 
More information about the Oyster Recycling program and upcoming volunteer opportunities can be found on the CRCL’s website 
Shell’s Social Investment program awards grants to nonprofit organizations that are primarily focused on environmental protection and restoration, education and community development.  Consideration for grants is based on a number of criteria including prioritizing charitable contributions to eligible nonprofit organizations with projects in communities where operates and that align with our business drivers and specific project needs. You can learn more about Shell’s commitment to safely and responsibly developing energy resources by reading Shell’s 2014 Sustainability Report.

New medicare option added for retirees
New medicare option added for retirees
Beginning January 1, 2018, will introduce the Medicare Advantage plan, available nationally to eligible Medicare retirees and their eligible Medicare dependents. This new medical plan will provide broad national coverage like our traditional Medicare Complementary plan, but at lower premiums and with convenient copay-based coverage for many health care services.
will introduce a group Medicare Advantage plan for 2018 that will provide broad national coverage like our traditional Medicare Complementary plan, but at lower premiums and with convenient copay-based coverage for many health care services.
The new plan, insured by UnitedHealthcare
®
, provides all the benefits of original Medicare (Parts and B) and includes:
lower out-of-pocket costs with no annual deductible; coinsurance is replaced with fixed-dollar copays for many services such as physician office visits, inpatient hospitalization and urgent care;
access to UnitedHealthcare’s broad national network of Medicare Advantage providers;
the ability to see both in- and out-of-network providers and pay the same cost share (as long as they accept the plan and have not opted out of Medicare);
access to registered nurses to address your health concerns 24 hours a day; and
additional health and wellness programs, such as SilverSneakers
® 
, not currently covered under the Medicare Complementary plan.
Retirees and dependents who are currently enrolled in the Medicare Complementary plan and who meet Medicare’s eligibility criteria for enrollment into a Medicare Advantage plan will automatically be enrolled into the new Medicare Advantage plan for 2018. Note that prescription drug coverage under the plan will be administered through SilverScript
®
 and is the same as the coverage available today.
To learn more, plan on attending an education meeting in October (
Education Meeting Invite
), and read the 
announcement brochure
 and 
frequently asked questions
 that were mailed to eligible retirees and dependents.

Hydrogen for fuel cell electric vehicle and heavy-duty trucks 
Hydrogen for fuel cell electric vehicle and heavy-duty trucks 
2018-10-03
Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEV), powered by hydrogen, provide long range and fast 3-minute refueling with zero emissions. They are an attractive option for many customers and will play a role alongside battery electric vehicles in a global low-carbon mobility future. Hydrogen fuel cell technology is also highly suited to heavy-duty applications where weight of the powertrain is an important factor. 
Collaboration Brings More Hydrogen Stations
currently operates two hydrogen refueling stations in California, located in Newport Beach and Torrance. Additionally, in collaboration with Honda and Toyota, is bringing seven new hydrogen refueling stations to the state; three in the city of San Francisco, and one in each of Berkeley, Sacramento, Citrus Heights and Walnut Creek. The hydrogen refueling stations will be installed in strategic locations within the existing network of Shell-branded retail stations, offering existing and future fuel cell electric vehicle drivers high-quality service with simple and straightforward car refueling in minutes. 
Hydrogen for Heavy Duty Transport
For heavy-duty transport, is working to develop hydrogen-truck refueling stations in California at the Port of Long Beach and the Port of Los Angeles.
and Toyota are developing the first hydrogen-truck refueling station at the Port of Long Beach. and Toyota expect the facility to encourage the use of zero-emission hydrogen fuel cell electric trucks in and around Long Beach, one of the world’s largest freight hubs. will build, own and operate a hydrogen station at the Toyota Logistics Services location at the Port of Long Beach, fueling Toyota’s Project Portal heavy-duty fuel cell proof of concept truck and public fleets. will source its hydrogen from Toyota’s adjacent Tri-Gen facility, which produces hydrogen from 100 percent renewable biogas.
Honda and Toyota working with At the Port of Los Angeles, Shell, Toyota and Kenworth are collaborating with the port to develop a fuel-cell-electric technology network for freight transport to move goods from “Shore to Store.” The project provides a large-scale “shore to store” plan and a hydrogen fuel-cell-electric technology framework for freight facilities to structure operations for future goods movement. The initiative will help reduce emissions by 465 metric tons of Greenhouse Gas and 0.72 weighted tons of NOx, and PM10. Two new large capacity heavy-duty hydrogen fueling stations will be developed by in Wilmington and Ontario, California. The new stations will join three additional stations located at Toyota facilities around Los Angeles to form an integrated, five-station heavy-duty hydrogen fueling network.
Together, they will provide multiple sources of hydrogen throughout the region, including over 1 ton of 100 percent renewable hydrogen per day at the heavy-duty station to be operated by Shell, enabling zero-emissions freight transport. The stations will be supplied by Air Liquide at Toyota Logistics Services in Long Beach and the Toyota Technical Center in Gardena will serve as an important research and development location.

Global Robotics Competition in Mexico Tackles Energy Challenges
Global Robotics Competition in Mexico Tackles Energy Challenges
2018-09-04
was a Silver sponsor of the 2018 Global Challenge in Mexico City, where global teams came together to solve energy challenges in an Olympics-style robot competition.
was a Silver Sponsor of the 2018 Global Challenge, which invited teams from across the world to come together in Mexico City to compete in an Olympics-style robot competition.
Robot alliances may sound like a thing of the future—but this year, at the 2018 Global Robotics Challenge in Mexico City, they were very much a reality.
was a Silver Sponsor of the 2018 (“For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology”) Global Challenge, which invited teams from across the world to come together in August to compete in an Olympics-style robot competition. The mission of the Global Challenge reflects how science and engineering, in an environment of collaboration, communication and teamwork, can solve many of the challenges humanity faces.
This year’s theme was “Energy Impact.” Students aged 14 to 18 and their mentors were challenged to spend three days developing robots to improve energy efficiency across the value chain. National teams then established alliances of three and competed to deliver various types of fuel to power plants and build resilient transmission networks. Teams accrued points for their robot’s functional success, but also won cooperation points if they successfully collaborated with other robots within the alliance to achieve the collective goal.
Alberto De La Fuente, Country Chair Mexico, who attended this year’s Global Robotics Challenge, remarked, “has long supported programs that enable young people to pursue Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education. These skills are at the very heart of our company, and they help equip future generations to lead the energy transition and bring fresh talent and ideas into our industry.”
Shell's presence in Mexico has grown rapidly over the last 12 months. Looking ahead, the plans to invest more in the country, through both its Upstream and Downstream organizations. Since September 2017, has opened more than 150 retail stations in nine states in Mexico.
“Mexico is going to be an important part of Shell’s future, with expected strong growth in our retail business and potential to become another heartland for our deep water business. Sponsoring the Global Robotics Challenge shows we are taking an active role as a community member and supporting the development of skills that will enable future generations here in Mexico and abroad.”

Workforce Development & Diversity Outreach Helps to Build Future Technical Workers
Workforce Development & Diversity Outreach Helps to Build Future Technical Workers
2018-04-04
Every day, engineers shatter the meaning of impossible. Our chemists formulate industry-leading products, while skilled workers in every trade operate our rigs and refineries safely. Accountants, experts and other pros keep our businesses running
All of these diverse workers have one thing in common: strong technical training. The question is, will today’s students be prepared to step into these roles tomorrow?
To make sure the answer is “Yes!”, Shell’s Workforce Development and Diversity Outreach (WDDO) group has already participated in several proactive programs this year. The activities are part of an ongoing, multi-faceted strategy that encourages a diverse range of students to follow technical career paths, according to manager Frazier Wilson
“Not enough students are studying science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) subjects. And many of those who do choose a career path take their skills to other industries,” Wilson explains. According to a 2017 study, 62% of today’s students find a career in and gas unappealing. disproportionate number of these are women.
To maintain a pipeline of future talent for Shell, the group partners with businesses and with numerous organizations that are working to reverse these trends. Most programs target middle and high school students, who are often pressured to make uninformed education choices that will profoundly affect their lives. Last year, the group’s programs reached 1 million students, 90,000 parents and 145,000 teachers.
Students danced with excitement to the tunes of Shell’s Make the Future video during a presentation by Susan Moore, Project Delivery Manager – Vito, SIEP
Here’s a look at some activities so far this year:
Helping Kids Make the Future
As a major sponsor of the DiscoverFuture City Competition national finals in Washington, D.C., delivered a clear message to budding engineers: Students who develop their skills can help overcome today’s energy challenges and make a better future.
​DiscoverSusan Moore
Students danced with excitement to the tunes of Shell’s Make the Future video during a presentation by Susan Moore, Project Delivery Manager – Vito, Susan, who also sits on the DiscoverLeadership Council, has served as an inspirational role model for aspiring female engineers at the event for three years.
More than 40,000 middle-school students from 1,350 schools participated in this prestigious engineering challenge. But the group used social media to reach students beyond the immediate audience. Susan’s talk streamed live on DiscoverE’s Facebook page and website. She also promoted the program in a video. Updates via twitter helped keep students engaged even after the competition.
The Shell-sponsored Trailblazer recently rolled in to Kermit, Texas
Blazing Trails in Texas
The Shell-sponsored Trailblazer recently rolled in to Kermit, Texas, the epicenter of Shell’s Permian Basin activities. Built and operated by volunteer engineers for the Texas Alliance for Minorities in Engineering (TAME), the 40-foot mobile trailer showcases career opportunities for the next generation. About 145 middle school students and 120 4th graders explored the hands-on exhibits in the trailer. Local volunteers teamed up with high school students to serve as guides.
At the end of the school day, Scott Scheffler and Laura Snyder from the External Relations visited the club at Kermit Junior High School, where students were building solar ovens and programming robots. sponsors the after-school program through the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) National Educational Services Centers.
Encouraging Curiosity
Science projects have the power to spark imaginations and inspire a lifelong interest in subjects. Showing a project at a science fair can be life-changing. Perhaps remembering their own early beginnings, 16 professionals (including eight with PhD’s) eagerly volunteered as judges for the 59th annual Science Engineering Fair of Houston.
Held at the University of Houston, the event is the largest science fair of its kind in Texas and one of the largest in the world. Last year, 1,367 students from 135 middle and high schools displayed their projects in several categories, ranging from animal science to mathematics. These represented the best of more than 35,000 projects that were entered in preliminary competitions.

Helping Hispanics Connect with College
volunteers and their families once again rallied to support education at the Houston Hispanic Forum’s 32nd Annual Career and Education Day. Some served as panelists while others staffed the booth. All served as role models to the estimated 13,000 students and their families who poured into the George Brown Convention Center in Houston.
signature program for the Hispanic Employee Network (SHEN), the event connected students and their parents with all the resources they need to prepare for college. Representatives from more than 100 colleges, universities and trade schools explained the admission process. Experts helped students apply for financial aid on the spot. Meanwhile, teachers attended workshops to help them prepare students for higher education.
Students who visited the booth learned about career opportunities by playing the Career Quiz. Many of those who donned virtual reality goggles to play Shell’s Hydrocarbon Hunt game said it changed their perception of the and gas industry.
How important is this event?
Official counts aren’t in yet, but 80% of the students who attended last year said the Career and Education Day persuaded them to go to college.

Lafon Performing Arts Center Receives $5 Million Gift From Norco
Lafon Performing Arts Center Receives $5 Million Gift From Norco
2018-08-28
Norco has committed to providing a $5 million legacy gift for the Dr. Rodney Lafon Performing Arts Center in Luling. Norco General Manager Brett Woltjen announced the legacy gift at the new center’s ribbon-cutting ceremonies held on Saturday, August 25, 2018. The gift will be made over the next several years to establish an endowment for sustainability of current and future programs dedicated to the center.
Norco General Manager Brett Woltjen receives standing ovation from school system officials after announcing legacy gift to the Lafon Arts Center.
Woltjen addressed St. Charles Parish School Board members, St. Charles Parish Public School administrators and faculty, government officials, parents, students, the Lafon family and members of the community who attended the formal opening ceremonies.
“This state-of-the-art facility will serve as an educational and cultural hub for students, the community and the region,” Woltjen said. “It is a pleasure for to continue its support of the St. Charles Parish Public School System. This gift speaks to the confidence has in the public school system and school board to carry out the common goals we share. We all want the best for our children and the best for our community as well as an enhanced quality of life now and in the future.”
Emphasizing Shell’s long history in Norco and in St. Charles Parish, as well as its commitment to supporting education and investment in the area’s youth, Woltjen noted the company’s belief in the importance of education.
“The roots of success originate in educational excellence and the ability to prepare today’s children to enter tomorrow’s workplace,” he said. “Recognizing that the children of our employees, our neighbors and their families will utilize this facility for generations to come, we wanted to identify an opportunity to be part of this endeavor.”
St. Charles Parish Public Schools Superintendent Felecia Gomez-Walker expressed gratitude for Shell’s contribution.
"want to personally thank for the tremendous gift it has given the school system. The partnership between St. Charles Parish Public Schools and Norco over the years has always been strong. The funding of an endowment for the Lafon Performing Arts Center is unmistakably the most significant contribution from industry that has ever been made to the school system. It also has special meaning to our school system and community as it elevates arts education and appreciation. We are extremely proud of this facility and the opportunities it provides for our students and citizens. can be proud and confident that its purpose and presence will be clearly evident," said Gomez-Walker.
According to Woltjen, the endowment represents a commitment of a $5 million sponsorship of the Dr. Rodney Lafon Performing Arts Center to the St. Charles for Parish Public School System over a five-year period.
Ideally, Shell’s initial contribution to this endowment will prompt an annual fundraising campaign where by others will help to grow the fund, resulting in positive impacts to the center.
Through the endowment gift, the 1,304-seat theatre within the Dr. Rodney Lafon Performing Arts Center will be named ‘The Theatre’ for an initial 20-year period. At the end of the twentieth year, a minimum annual promissory gift of $50,000.00 will be made to the endowment maintaining the naming rights in perpetuity.
The $34 million, 69,000 square foot facility, named in honor of former St. Charles Parish Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Rodney Lafon, was constructed as part of a bond issue approved by St. Charles Parish voters in 2015.
In addition to the 1,304-seat Theatre, the Dr. Lafon Performing Arts Center features a 200-seat black box theatre, a large dance studio, educational wing inclusive of multiple visual art and ensemble rehearsal studios, a television production suite, piano lab, and digital and interactive media labs.

Powering Progress Together: News & Events
Refinery Employee Celebrates 44 Years of Service
Refinery Employee Celebrates 44 Years of Service
2018-06-04
Puget Sound Refinery’s longest-serving employee Boyd Wells never imagined that he’d work at the for over 44 years. But after nearly 10 roles and hundreds of teammates later, he’s happier than ever. Why? For Boyd, it’s all about the people.
We sat down with Boyd to learn more about how the refinery has changed over time, what he’s most proud of, and why safety hits close to home.
Tell us a bit about your childhood.
grew up in Coupeville, and was one of five kids. was very close with my dad, and we spent many hours exploring the outdoors together. He was probably the most importance influence over the course of my life. Following high school, spent two years at a community college studying business.
What did you want to be as a kid when you grew up?
wanted to own a Christmas tree farm!
When did you start working at Shell’s Puget Sound Refinery?
I’m now in my 44
th
 year, which is hard to believe! joined the site part-time in 1974 working in the storehouse, and then transitioned to a full-time role in accounting about five years later. After a five-year stint there, moved to business planning for nearly 10 years. From there, became a processing unit foreman for 14 years.
moved to Convent, in 2005 to work in the reliability group at Shell’s Convent Refinery, but came back to the Pacific Northwest two years later since my sister was battling cancer. When returned to Puget, served as a production supervisor on the west side of the refinery for nine years before becoming an infrastructure lead.
What do you like most about working at the refinery?
That’s easy – it’s all about the people. have worked with so many incredible folks from all backgrounds, races, ages and experiences, and we’ve had a lot of fun over the years. The common bond between us is that we want to do our best work, and we want to do it safely so everyone goes home to their families the same way they arrived. We’re all one team here.
Show all questions
Boyd and his wife have five kids and 10 grandkids. He says that his family is his ‘guiding light.’
How has the site changed since you joined in 1974?
The amount of modernization that has done here is phenomenal, and the increased focus on process safety is best-in-class. deeply embedded safety culture exists across all departments and levels now, which is critical since we have many more units with very complex operating processes.
Why is safety important to you?
Safety is everything. Without it, we don’t operate. remember the fatalities that we had here at the site in the late 1990s, and never want to feel that way again. Safety really hit home for me during those two incidents since we lost lives…someone lost a husband, mother, sister, brother, etc. on those days.
The culture here now is safety first at all times – it’s not a ‘make money at all costs’ type of mentality in any way. At the end of the day, we must be able to make money safely in order to achieve success inside and outside of the plant. We owe that to ourselves, our teammates, our families, our environment and our communities.
Why are you proud to work here?
I’m proud of the people I’ve had the opportunity to work with over the years, and I’m even prouder of what we have accomplished together for our families and our communities. The jobs here change lives and strengthen communities, and I’ve experienced that firsthand.
What’s your life like outside of work?
live in Oak Harbor, WA, and I’m married with five kids and 10 grandkids. My family is my guiding light, and am so fulfilled by watching my loved ones succeed and thrive. My hobbies include hunting, camping, fishing and hosting barbecues with our neighbors and friends.
What’s something that most people don’t know about you?
In the 1970s before joined the refinery, fished in Alaska off Kodiak Island. remember all kinds of situations, from pulling a distressed fishing boat away from hitting the rocks in rough seas, to towing a distressed fishing boat across the Gulf of Alaska south of the Cook Inlet in very high seas. Check out the photo below for a shot of a compass that found in an abandoned fishing boat that was half-sunken on the rocks going into Old Harbor on Kodiak.
Show all questions
Boyd found this compass in an abandoned fishing boat near Kodiak, AK.
Do you have any plans to retire soon?
No way! Even after 44 years with the company, I’m still learning new things and receiving opportunities to work on unique projects that challenge me in different ways. Plus, what would do with my time if retired? can’t just sit around and twiddle my thumbs! really want to give back to the site at this point in my career, and I’m finally in a position to do that. This refinery is truly my second home.
What type of legacy do you want to leave when you eventually retire?
want people to say that they genuinely enjoyed working with me and that they always felt like their voice was heard. hope they view me as a team player as well.

The vision of Leadership Skagit is to develop leaders at all levels across Skagit County, and Shell’s Puget Sound Refinery has partnered with the program since 2008.
It’s Shredding Time
For Puget Sound Refinery Operator Dan Donnelly, snowboarding is a way of life. While he no longer ‘shreds’ every day as a professional snowboarder, his experiences in the backcountry gave him a deep appreciation for safety and what it truly means to have someone’s back.
