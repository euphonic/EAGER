produces the industry’s lowest-cost solar silicon while delivering performance on par with silicon produced via the standard “Siemens” method.
While both the Siemens and processes begin with metallurgical-grade silicon (MG-Si) and end with purified silicon for solar cells and modules, it’s what happens in between that sets apart.

MANUFACTURING
Polysilicon manufacturing can be one of the most environmentally hazardous product processes in the solar value chain, partially because the Siemens method requires large amounts of volatile trichlorosilane gas. By contrast, Silicor’s process requires no handling of hazardous gases, improving safety for both workers and the surrounding environment.

is a global leader in the production of solar silicon. The company is headquartered San Jose, California with a Research and Development team located in Berlin, Germany.
The organization was founded as a development company in 2006 under the name Calisolar, with the goal of manufacturing low-cost photovoltaic (PV) solar cells from silicon designed specifically for the solar industry (“solar silicon”) rather than electronic-grade polysilicon. Among the company's founding members is solar energy pioneer Dr. Eicke Weber, Director of the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE.
Supported by venture financing from Hudson Clean Energy Partners, LP, Advanced Technology Ventures and Globespan Capital Partners, the company built its management and engineering teams; in 2009, construction was completed on a 60 cell production facility, consisting of a vertically integrated ingot, wafer and cell manufacturing line in Sunnyvale, California.
6Silicon Acquisition and Early Manufacturing Success
In 2010, acquired its primary upstream solar silicon supplier, 6Silicon (“6N”), based in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. The acquisition enabled the company to secure access to a single, reliable solar silicon feedstock for its cell and wafer processing and further improve its cost position by eliminating the profit margin on purchased solar silicon.
Nearly 700of solar silicon was manufactured in 6N’s Vaughan facility through 2012 – roughly half of this material was sold and shipped global to solar wafer, cell and module customers, while the balance was used to produce more than 20 million cells on Calisolar’s manufacturing line in California. These cells are currently in operation in solar modules around the world.
In 2012, having proven the viability of its solar silicon to manufacture cells with performance equivalent to those made with electronic grade polysilicon, the company divested its California cell manufacturing line and officially changed its name to Materials. Today, the company focuses exclusively on delivering the industry’s highest quality solar silicon that could help improve margins for global cell and module manufacturers.
Manufacturing Challenges
In 2012, selected Lowndes County, Mississippi as the location of its first large-scale solar silicon manufacturing plant. Unfortunately, it was also during this time that a global solar industry trade battle began to escalate, with the and ultimately imposing hefty tariffs on cells and/or modules exported from China. When Chinese regulators in turn announced they would review silicon imports from the U.S., South Korea and EU, it became clear that the resulting tariffs could seriously impact Silicor’s ability to provide its material to the world’s largest region for solar manufacturing. In light of this significant risk, made the difficult decision to withdraw its plans for the Mississippi facility and explore alternative sites outside the This decision proved to be in the best interests of all involved – in September 2013, the Chinese government issued provisional tariffs on silicon imparts from the U.S., ranging from 53.7% to 59.5%. remains hopeful that this dispute will one day see resolution, allowing the company to site a future plant in the U.S.
In July 2014, announced the selection of a location in Iceland for its next facility, with a nameplate capacity of 16,000expects to begin production at this facility in 2018, will full production in 2019.

and Technical Solutions Close $8.9Project Management Contract
August 10, 2016
JOSE, Calif. -- 
Materials, Inc., a manufacturer of high-quality solar silicon and aluminum by-products, today announced the signing of a contract with 
Technical Solutions (AMTS)
 – a construction and project management and facility solutions firm for the high tech markets – for the project management of Silicor’s first commercial-scale plant in Grundartangi, Iceland. The project is expected to break ground before the end of 2016 and be fully operational by 2019.
The companies will work together over the next 36 months to complete the 121,000 square-meter production facility, which will supply photovoltaic (PV) cell and module manufacturers around the world with at least 19,000 metric tons of solar silicon each year. Under the terms of the agreement, worth more than $8.9USD, is responsible for overseeing and executing the project’s strict timeline and controlling the budget throughout the construction process.
“We pride ourselves on our ability to bring projects to completion under budget and in a timely fashion – and look forward to doing so with Materials’ first commercial-scale facility,” said Sandeep Davé, Chief Business Officer of “AMTS’ goal is to deliver excellent results for at impressive scale, recognizing that this facility will place among the world’s top six solar silicon producers by volume.”
Silicor's solar silicon is a lower-cost, environmentally friendly alternative to traditional polysilicon, allowing manufacturers to reduce production costs with no impact to product performance or quality. The material, which currently powers more than 20 million cells around the world, is produced through a proprietary metals-based process that consumes significantly less energy than traditional methods.
“With over 20 years of experience in the high tech building and project management space, is uniquely qualified to bring Silicor’s first commercial-scale facility to life in an ambitious timeframe,” said Terry Jester, of Materials. “will help make a huge impact on renewable energy. Once we are running at full capacity, Silicor’s flagship facility in Grundartangi will produce enough silicon annually to make solar panels for 800,000 homes.”
selected the Austin, Texas-based because of the company’s international experience and strong track record managing the construction of complex high tech facilities. will integrate the civil construction and process equipment elements of the project.
This news comes on the heels of Silicor’s equipment contract with Siemag as well as its construction contract with Højgaard.
