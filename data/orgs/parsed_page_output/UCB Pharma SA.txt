was created in Brussels by Emmanuel Janssen in the 1920s. The company expanded and entered the market in the 1930s. Our scientists’ first therapeutic breakthroughs came in the 1950s, followed in the 1960s by visionary research into the field of biotechnology.
The increasingly research-based company was growing. To keep up with its ambitions, expanded its R&networks, establishing a state-of-the-art facility in Braine-l’Alleud, Belgium in 1972.
significant breakthrough came in the 1980s when registered Zyrtec® – a novel antihistamine product. blockbuster was born, helping to further raise the profile of the company. second blockbuster – Keppra® – was launched in the 1990s, spurring further global growth.
In the early years of the 21st century, began to transform into a pure biocompany. Significant milestones included the acquisition of Celltech, a British biotech firm in 2004, and then German company, Schwarz Pharma, in 2006.
At the same time, also filed its first biologic treatment and reshaped the organisation to ensure it was fit for the future. As the decade ended, our company was delivering strong results thanks to our innovative products. UCB’s core medicines have driven growth ever since.
Looking ahead, we are building on this position of strength and preparing the next wave of future medicines and solutions, driving future growth and creating value for patients.

WorldwideGreen Strategy
At UCB,  we take our responsibility to the planet very seriously. Our  goal is to  develop and produce medicines for people with severe  diseases in the  most environmentally sustainable way possible.
applies a precautionary approach in innovation and in the development of new products. We consider not only the benefits of our products but also the potential health and environmental risks in a scientific and transparent manner.
To reduce our impact, we work in 7 key areas:
Ensuring legal and regulatory compliance
Using natural resources responsibly
Promoting green chemistry
Actively managing waste streams
Sustainability and Stewardship
is committed to improving its carbon footprint, energy efficiency, water conservation and waste control. This benefits our company both environmentally and economically, creating a positive result for local communities. The commitment is illustrated by a transparent reporting system and growing engagement with suppliers and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs).
Saving energy
Cutting carbon emissions is central  to our green strategy. Our ambition to become carbon neutral by 2030  relates in first instance to the activities we control directly.  However, more than half of our total carbon footprint is produced by our  suppliers and contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs). That is why  we work closely with these partners to ensure they are transparently  reporting energy use and making every effort to reduce energy  consumption.
Our production sites consume a lot of energy. We  view thian opportunity to make a meaningful impact on our CO2  output. Last year, reduced overall energy consumption by 5%; usage  of gas and electricity was reduced by 9% and 4% respectively. These absolute reductions were partly due  to divestments.
Changing our energy consumption
Overall energy consumption ↓5%
Gas usage ↓9%
Electricity usage ↓4%
Energy  saving initiatives in 2017 saved 7 135 GigaJoules. Energy saving  projects were completed at the sites in Bulle (Swizerland), Braine  l’Alleud (Belgium) and Zhuhai (China).
How?
Key contributors were an optimization of the Multicolumn Continuous Chromatography (MCC) equipment used at the chemical production plant in Bulle and energy efficiency gains in the distribution of fluidthe chemical production plant in Braine l’Alleud and in the microbial inactivation procesthe bioplant in Bulle.
In 2017, 92% of the electricity consumed by originated from renewable sources, with six sites relying fully on  electricity generated from renewable sources, i.e., Bulle (Switzerland), Monheim (Germany), Atlanta (U.S.), Slough (U.K.) Braine-l’Alleud and Brussels (Belgium). Electricity sources include solar, wind and hydropower, as well as, biomass.
generated 2 336 GigaJoules of electricity through solar panels installed in Braine-l’Alleud and Bulle, an increase of 52% compared to 2016 due to the installation of additional solar panels in Braine l’Alleud.
In addition, we are working with our employees to achieve significant savings on business travel and  to reduce commuting.
Carbon compensation
To complement our efforts to reduce energy consumption and  to use as much as possible energy generated from renewable sources, embraces carbon compensation.
Forests are natural ‘sinks’ for carbon, absorbing tons of greenhouse gases every year. By investing in forestry, we can help to balance our overall carbon  impact.
Conserving water
Water is a precious resource. It playvital role in our production process and in climate control for our  products. Water consumption at facilities decreased by 6% in 2017 and we will continue to strive for greater efficiency.
Reducing waste
In 2017, waste generated at the facilities decreased by 19%. globally managed to recover 91% of its waste, predominantly through recovery of waste as a fuel to generate energy, and the recovery and regeneration of solvents. This percentage of recuperated waste steadily improved by more than 5%, when compared to 2010.Top of this page

Disclosure of payments
In everything we do, we always start by asking ourselves “How can we create more value for people living with severe diseases?"
In our effort to create more value for people living with severe diseases, we work in partnership with various stakeholders including healthcare professionals, healthcare organisations and patient organisations.
Our ongoing collaboration with healthcare stakeholders is essential to deliver solutions for patients’ unmet needs and to improve the overall quality of treatment.
We also actively support patient organisations’ initiatives which contribute to the improvement of patients’ health and quality of life.
We are committed to operate with the highest ethical standards and to ensure transparency on these engagements and associated 
transfers of value.

Tutto ciò che facciamo inizia con una semplice domanda: Che differenza farà nella vita delle persone che soffrono di malattie gravi?
È fondamentale per noi lavorare a stretto contatto con operatori sanitari in grado di offrirci la conoscenza e l’esperienza necessarie per fornire soluzioni in grado di migliorare la vita dei pazienti. Questa rete di relazioni ha già reso possibile fino ad oggi un significativo miglioramento della vita di numerosi pazienti. 
Desideriamo continuare a coltivare queste relazioni e, al contempo,  intendiamo mantenere elevati standard etici in tutte le nostre interazioni. Siamo fermamente convinti che garantire trasparenza nei rapporti tra e gli operatori sanitari sia essenziale per conservare e far crescere ulteriormente la fiducia dei nostri pazienti.
pazienti devono potersi fidare dei loro medici, certi che le prescrizioni, le cure somministrate e i trattamenti effettuati siano stati definiti unicamente a partire dalla loro competenza e da attendibili evidenze cliniche.
In quanto membro di (European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry and Associations) e di Farmindustria, si impegna a soddisfare i requisiti minimi di trasparenza definiti da questi enti e quindi anche a segnalare i trasferimenti di valore effettuati nei riguardi di operatori sanitari e di organizzazioni sanitarie.

alt vi gjør, starter vi alltid med å spørre oss selv ”Hvordan kan vi gi mennesker som har alvorlige sykdommer et bedre liv”?
Det er i pasientenes interesse at vi samarbeider med tett helsepersonell og helseorganisasjoner. Dette gir oss uvurderlig ekspertkunnslik at vi kan finne løsninger som bedrer pasientenes liv og behandling. Så langt har denne relasjonen bidradd til betydelig innovasjon innen helse, og har gitt mange positive endringer i livskvaliteten for mange pasienter.
Vi streber etter å opprettholde høy standard for etikk og integritet når det gjelder samhandling. Vi mener at det å sikre åpenhet med hensyn til finansielle relasjoner med helsepersonell er viktig for å øke pasientenes tillitt. Det er viktig at pasientene kan stole på at legen anbefaler, forskriver og gir riktig behandling, og at kun er basert på kliniske bevis og erfaring.
Som et EFPIA-medlem (European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry and Associations), er selskapet derfor forpliktet til å oppfylle kravene om offentliggjøring i henhold til Disclosure Code, og av den grunn rapportere verdioverføringer som gjøres til helsepersonell og helseorganisasjoner.
Dersom du har spørsmål om tiltak eller rapporter som offentliggjøres, ta kontakt med

Dette samtykket innebærer ikke tillatelse for andre som finner informasjon via vår webside, eller via annen nasjonal plattform, til å foreta ytterligere bearbeiding av personopplysningene om helsepersonell. For å få en god forståelse av informasjonen som publiseres anbefaler vi å lese metodenotatet som beskriver formål og innhold av de rapporterte verdioverføringene.

In everything we do, we always start by asking ourselves “How can we create more value for people living with severe diseases?".
In the interest of patients, it is crucial for us to collaborate closely with healthcare professionals and organisations, who offer us invaluable and expert knowledge to provide solutions improving patients’ lives and treatments.  This relationship has delivered significant innovations in healthcare so far and has made positive changes to the quality of life of numerous patients.
We aspire to maintain high standards of ethics and integrity in our interactions.  We strongly believe that ensuring transparency in our financial relationships with healthcare professionals is essential to increase patients’ trust.  Patients need to know that they can trust their doctors to recommend, prescribe and administer appropriate care and treatments based solely on clinical evidence and experience.
Member Company (European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry and Associations), we are therefore committed to meet the transparency requirements of the Disclosure Code and to report our transfers of value to healthcare stakeholders accordingly.

Vad vi än gör börjar vi alltid med att ställa oss själva frågan “Hur kan vi skapa mervärde för personer med svåra sjukdomar?".
Med tanke på patienternas bästa är det mycket viktigt för oss att ha ett nära samarbete med hälso- och sjukvårdspersonal samt organisationer, eftersom vi på så sätt får värdefull och sakkunnig information som vi behöver för att kunna erbjuda lösningar som förbättrar patienternas liv och behandlingar. Samarbetet har hittills åstadkommit betydande innovationer inom hälsovården och förbättrat livskvaliteten för ett stort antal patienter.
Vi strävar efter att i vårt samarbete upprätthålla en hög standard i fråga om etik och integritet. Vi är övertygade om att det är mycket viktigt att säkerställa att våra värdeöverföringar till hälso- och sjukvårdspersonal är transparenta för att öka patienternas förtroende. Patienterna bör kunna lita på att läkaren rekommenderar, förskriver och administrerar lämplig behandling uteslutande baserat på kliniska bevis och erfarenhet.
Som ett medlemsföretag i den europeiska branschorganisationen (European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry and Associations) har åtagit sig att följa transparensreglerna i EFPIA:s uppförandekod och att rapportera värdeöverföringar till aktörer inom hälso- och sjukvården i enlighet med dessa regler.  
Om du har frågor gällande transparensinitiativet eller rapporteringen kan du gärna kontakta oss på 
.

Syftet med publicering av värdeöverföringar till mottagare är att rapportera värdeöverföringar (monetära eller andra förmåner) till (hälso- och sjukvårdspersonal) eller (hälso- och sjukvård) som vårt företag samarbetar med eller har relationer till, enligt de mål och bestämmelser som ingår i tillämplig uppförandekod. Enskilda mottagare har gett sitt samtycke till rapportering på individnivå ‑ sådant samtycke har getts för att möjliggöra att publiceringarna överensstämmer med de uppförandekoder som vårt företag har undertecknat.
Dessa publiceringar ger inte ett allmänt tillstånd för dem som har tillträde till vår webbplats eller till nationella plattformer att ytterligare bearbeta hälso- och sjukvårdspersonalens data.
För en god förståelse av rapporten som publicerats på denna webbplats hänvisar vi till metodbeskrivningen som klargör betydelsen och innehållet av de rapporterade värdeöverföringarna.

В усьому, що ми робимо, ми завжди розпочинаємо  з питання до себе: “Як ми можемо створити дещо більш цінне  для людей, які живуть, страждаючи від тяжких хвороб?"
В інтересах пацієнтів вирішальною для нас є тісна співпраця з професіоналами з надання медичних послуг та з організаціями, які пропонують  нам безцінне та експертне знання для забезпечення рішень щодо поліпшення життя та лікування пацієнтів. Цей взаємозв’язок на даному етапі вніс значні інновації у надання медичних послуг та призвів до позитивних змін якості життя численних пацієнтів.
Ми прагнемо підтримувати високі стандарти етики та чесності у наших взаємовідносинах.  Ми рішуче віримо у те, що гарантування прозорості наших фінансових взаємовідносин з професіоналами з надання медичних послуг є необхідним для збільшення довіри з боку пацієнтів.  Пацієнтам потрібно знати, що вони можуть довіряти своїм лікарям, коли ті рекомендують, приписують, та здійснюють  відповідний догляд та лікування на підставі виключно клінічних фактів та досвіду.
Як компанія-член (Європейської федерації фармацевтичних виробників та асоціацій), ми прагнемо задовольнити вимоги Кодексу розкриття і відповідно звітувати про наші передачі коштів перед зацікавленими особами,  зайнятими наданням медичних послуг.
Якщо у Вас є будь-які питання щодо ініціатив із дотримання прозорості або стосовно звітів, будь ласка, зверніться до місцевої поштової скриньки.

Kaikkea toimintaamme ohjaa itsellemme aina ensin esittämämme kysymys: “Miten voin luoda enemmän arvoa niille, joilla on jokin vaikea sairaus?"
Tiivis yhteistyö terveydenhuollon ammattilaisten ja organisaatioiden kanssa on meille ehdottoman tärkeää potilaiden edun vuoksi: näiltä toimijoilta saamme mittaamattoman arvokasta ja asiantuntevaa tietoa, jonka perusteella voimme tarjota potilaiden elämää ja hoitoa parantavia ratkaisuja. Tähänastinen yhteistyö onkin jo synnyttänyt merkittäviä terveydenhoidon innovaatioita ja kohentanut lukemattomien potilaiden elämänlaatua.
Haluamme peruyhteistyömme korkeisiin eettisiin periaatteisiin ja lahjomattomuuteen. Uskomme vakaasti, että läpinäkyvyyden varmistaminen terveydenhuollon ammattilaisten kanssa solmittavissa taloudellisissa suhteissa on välttämätöntä potilaiden luottamuksen lisäämiseksi. Potilaiden on voitava luottaa siihen, että lääkäri suosittelee, määrää ja antaa asianmukaista hoitoa vain kliiniseen näyttöön ja kokemukseen perustuen.
on Euroopan lääketeollisuusliittojen kattojärjestön EFPIA:n (European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry and Associations) jäsenyrityksenä sitoutunut noudattamaan EFPIA:n taloudellisten suhteiden läpinäkyvyyttä ja julkistamista koskevia ohjeita ja raportoimaan niiden mukaisesti terveydenhuollon toimijoille antamansa taloudelliset etuudet.
Jos teillä on kysyttävää taloudellisten suhteiden läpinäkyvyyttä koskevista asioista tai etuuksien raportoinnivastaamme mielellämme sähköpostiosoittee.

Bármit is teszünk, először mindig ezt kérdezzük magunktól: “Hogyan teremthetünk mind több értéket a súlyos betegségekben szenvedő emberek számára?”
betegek érdekében nagyon fontos számunkra, hogy szorosan együttműködjünk az egészségügyi szakemberekkel és szervezetekkel, akik felbecsülhetetlen értékű szakmai tudást biztosítanak számunkra ahhoz, hogy olyan megoldásokat találjunk, amelyek javítják a betegek életminőségét és ellátását. Ez a kapcsolat már eddig is jelentős újításokhoz vezetett az egészségügyben, és pozitív változásokat eredményezett sok beteg életminőségében.
Arra törekszünk, hogy az együttműködéseink során folyamatosan etikusan, következetesen és tisztességesen járjunk el. Szilárd meggyőződésünk, hogy az átláthatóság biztosítása az egészségügyi szakemberekkel folytatott pénzügyi kapcsolataink során alapvető fontosságú a betegek bizalmának növelése érdekében. betegeknek tudniuk kell, hogy bízhatnak abban, hogy kezelőorvosuk a megfelelő ellátást és kezeléseket ajánlja, írja fel és alkalmazza náluk, kizárólag a klinikai gyakorlatban szerzett bizonyítékok és tapasztalatok alapján.
Az (Európai Gyógyszergyártók és Egyesületek Szövetsége – European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations) egyik tagvállalataként elkötelezettek vagyunk az iránt, hogy megfeleljünk az Transzparencia Kódex (Disclosure Code) átláthatósági követelményeinek, és abban, hogy ennek megfelelően nyilvánosságra hozzuk az egészségügyi partnereinknek nyújtott juttatásainkat.
Ha bármilyen kérdése van a transzparencia kezdeményezésekkel, illetve a közzétételi jelentéssel kapcsolatban, kérjük, írjon az alábbi e-mail címre:

Adatvédelmi tájékoztatás
Az az Transzparencia Kódex célja és rendelkezései értelmében nyilvánosságra hozza az egészségügyi szakemberek és egészségügyi szervezetek számára nyújtott pénzbeli és természetbeni juttatásai részleteit. Mivel az elkötelezett az iránt, hogy a megfelelő adatvédelmi törvények betartásával járjon el, az egyéni kedvezményezettek neve alatt történő közzététel esetén az biztosítja, hogy az aktuális közzététel előtt megkapja az érintett egészségügyi szakemberek egyéni hozzájárulását.
Az egészségügyi szakemberek és egészségügyi szervezetek számára nyújtott pénzbeli és természetbeni juttatások nyilvánosságra hozatala az weboldalán, illetve egyéb nemzeti weboldalakon nem jogosítja fel az oldalra látogatókat arra, hogy bármilyen egyéb módon kezeljék az egészségügyi szakemberek és egészségügyi szervezetek közzétett adatait.
jelen weboldalon közzétett adatok megfelelő értelmezése érdekében kérjük, tájékozódjon az Módszertani Leveléből, amely részletes magyarázatot biztosít a közzétett juttatások természetére és tartalmára vonatkozóan.

In tot ceea ce facem, începem întotdeauna prin a ne pune întrebarea: „Cum am putea crea o valoare mai mare pentru persoanele care trăiesc cu boli severe?”
În interesul pacienților, este crucial pentru noi să colaborăm îndeaproape cu profesioniștii și organizațiile din domeniul medical, care ne oferă cunoștințe valoroase și de specialitate pentru a furniza soluții care să îmbunătățească viața pacienților și tratamentele acestora.  Această relație a dat naștere până în acest moment unor inovații semnificative în domeniul medical și a generat schimbări pozitive în ceea ce privește calitatea vieții unui mare număr de pacienți.
Aspirația noastră este menținerea unor standarde înalte de etică și integritate în cadrul interacțiunilor noastre.  Credem cu tărie că asigurarea transparenței în relațiile noastre financiare cu profesioniștii din domeniul medical este esențială pentru a crește nivelul de încredere din partea pacienților noștri.  Pacienții trebuie să știe că pot avea încredere în faptul că medicii lor le vor recomanda, prescrie și administra îngrijirea și tratamentele adecvate, bazate exclusiv pe dovezile și experiența clinică.
Prin urmare, în postura de companie membră a  (Federația Europeană a Industriilor și Asociațiilor Farmaceutice), ne luăm angajamentul să îndeplinim cerințele de transparență ale Codului de Transparență și să raportăm în mod corespunzător transferurile de valoare către părțile interesate din domeniul medical.  
Dacă aveți orice fel de întrebări legate de inițiativele sau rapoartele privind transparența, vă rugăm să contactați

Zij bieden ons immers expertise van onschatbare waarde in onze zoektocht naar oplossingen om de levenskwaliteit en de behandeling van patiënten te verbeteren. Deze samenwerking zorgde reeds voor belangrijke vernieuwingen in de gezondheidszorg en droeg bij tot een stijging in de levenskwaliteit van talrijke patiënten.
Bij zulke interacties streven wij naar het behoud van integriteit en hoge ethische standaarden. Om het vertrouwen van de patiënt te bevorderen geloven we dat het essentieel is om transparantie te garanderen in onze financiële relaties met beroepsbeoefenaren in de gezondheidszorg. Patiënten moeten er ten volle op kunnen vertrouwen dat hun arts zich uitsluitend baseert op het wetenschappelijk bewijs en de klinische ervaring bij het aanbevelen, voorschrijven en verlenen van de juiste zorg en behandeling.

alle vores handlinger, starter vi altid med at spørge os selv ”Hvordan kan vi skabe mere værdi for mennesker, som lever med alvorlige sygdomme?”.
Af hensyn til patienterne er det afgørende for oarbejde tæt sammen med sundhedspersoner og organisationer, der tilbyder os uvurderlig ekspertviden for at tilvejebringe løsninger, som forbedrer patienternes liv og behandling. Dette samarbejde har indtil videre resulteret i væsentlige nyskabelser i sundhedsvæsenet og har medført forbedringer i livskvaliteten hos mange patienter.
vores interaktion med andre stræber vi efter at opretholde høj etisk standard og integritet. Vi er overbeviste om, at det at vise gennemsigtighed i forhold til vores finansielle relationer med sundhedspersoner, er afgørende for at øge patienternes tillid. Patienterne vide, at de kan stole på, at deres læges anbefalinger, ordinationer, administration af passende pleje samt behandling udelukkende er baseret på klinisk evidens og erfaring.
Som medlem af (European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry and Associations) er vi forpligtede til at møde gennemsigtighedskravene i EFPIAs kodeks, herunder at indberette betalinger til sundhedspersoner.
Hvis du har spørgsmål til initiativerne omkring gennemsigtighed eller indberetninger, kan du kontakte

Het uitgangspunt bij al onze activiteiten is steeds: “Hoe kunnen we een meerwaarde creëren voor mensen die leven met ernstige ziekten ?”.
In het belang van de patiënt is het cruciaal dat we nauw samenwerken met beroepsbeoefenaren en organisaties in de gezondheidszorg.  Zij bieden ons immers expertise van onschatbare waarde in onze zoektocht naar oplossingen om de levenskwaliteit en de behandeling van patiënten te verbeteren. Deze samenwerking zorgde reeds voor belangrijke vernieuwingen in de gezondheidszorg en droeg bij tot een stijging in de levenskwaliteit van talrijke patiënten.
Bij zulke interacties streven wij naar het behoud van integriteit en hoge ethische standaarden.  Om het vertrouwen van de patiënt te bevorderen geloven we dat het essentieel is om transparantie te garanderen in onze financiële relaties met beroepsbeoefenaren in de gezondheidszorg. Patiënten moeten er ten volle op kunnen vertrouwen dat hun arts zich uitsluitend baseert op het wetenschappelijk bewijs en de klinische ervaring bij het aanbevelen, voorschrijven en verlenen van de juiste zorg en behandeling.
Als lid van de (Europese Federatie van de Farmaceutische Industrie en Verenigingen), verbindt ons bedrijf zich ertoe om de transparantieregels van de ‘Disclosure Code’ te implementeren en onze betalingen aan stakeholders in de gezondheidszorg openbaar te maken.
Als u vragen heeft omtrent het transparantieproject of de openbaarmaking ervan, kunt u ons contacteren via:

De publicatie van de betalingen aan stakeholders richt zich op het openbaar maken van betalingen (geld of in natura) aan beroepsbeoefenaren en organisaties in de gezondheidssector waar ons bedrijf mee samenwerkt/relaties mee heeft. Dit gebeurt volgens de doelstellingen en bepalingen die opgenomen werden in de Disclosure code. De individuele openbaarmakingen werden toegezegd door de individuele begunstigden. Deze toestemming tot openbaarmaking werd gegeven om te kunnen voldoen aan de van toepassing zijnde codes die door ons bedrijf ondertekend werden.
Deze publicaties geven geen algemene toestemming aan diegenen die toegang hebben tot onze website of de nationale platforms, om extra verwerking van de gegevens van de beroepsbeoefenaren in de gezondheidszorg te ondernemen.

aims to make every element of our businesgreen as possible. That is why we are rethinking 
our approach to packaging
.
Until recently, our efforts were focused on being compliant with regulations and improving the user experience. We are now shifting our approach, giving greater importance to sustainable design and materials. 
recognises that improving our product packaging, through collaboration with patients and users, presentopportunity to enhance the sustainability of our operations. Packaging design iimportant part of delivering value to patients while reducing our products’ environmental footprint. 
Listening to public feedback on our products, including their packaging, is a central part of our commitment to improve what we do. The message we hear is that the production, transport and packaging of our products should minimise the use of plastics and maximise recyclability. 
We are rising to the challenge of creating packaging that is greener, compliant with on-pack labelling requirements, includes measures to combat counterfeit drugs, meet cost constraints, and fulfils the need to make an emotional connection with patients, while enhancing patient compliance. This is a work in progress and we are committed to getting it right. 
Greener by design 
Along with improving the user experience, this collaborative approach is helping us to make packaging more environmentally friendly. We are prioritising the use of recyclable materials, responsible sourcing, resource recovery (recycling), efficient transport and distribution. 
For example, by reducing the pack size while maintaining the same amount of medicines we can use less material and transport more products on each pallet. Reducing the weight of packaging also translates into lower use of fuel in transport. 
In collaboration with patients and design experts, we have reduced the plastic content of the packaging on some of our leading medicines by as much as 85% and reduced the carboard content by 41%. By using recyclable materials and ensuring the packaging components can be segregated for recycling, we are applying the best in design thinking to optimise our packaging. 
Collaborative design  
As some of our products are self-administered by patients with severe conditions – such as rheumatoid arthritis or Parkinson’s disease – the distinct needs of the user must be considered carefully. 
For example, our new auto-click prefilled pen, used to deliver rheumatoid arthritis medication in Japan, was developed based on market research and input from users. Research showed us that ease of drug administration was a key concern for users and that patients in Japan valued simple, crisp packaging design. 
By consulting patients and patient representatives, we will collaboratively develop best-in-class package designs that meet the needs of users while removing inefficiencies. 
continues to make sustainability and usability key priorities in the design of our products and packaging.  By making sustainability a design priority, we will further reduce our carbon footprint and our impact on the environment.
