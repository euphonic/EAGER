TODAY
Nanotechnology is the understanding and control of matter at the nanoscale, at dimensions between approximately 1 and 100 nanometers, where unique phenomena enable novel applications. Encompassing nanoscale science, engineering, and technology, nanotechnology involves imaging, measuring, modeling, and manipulating matter at this length scale. 
Matter such as gases, liquids, and solids can exhibit unusual physical, chemical, and biological properties at the nanoscale. Consequently nanotechnology does not represent just the next step in miniaturization; it represents new possibilities for solving some of the world's most difficult challenges.  Nanotechnology offers new ways to resolve issues on global scale as well as local; to build safer oil pipelines, engineer more effective drugs, and boost the global food supply.
Nanotechnology Challenges 
Nanoparticle science and manufacturing generally face challenges in three areas.
Efficacy: Most nanoparticles are not solid metal, can't be manufactured to specific sizes and fall out of solution quickly. This means that for their limited applications, they are less powerful and have a short shelf life.
Toxicity:  Most nanoparticles are ionic and use chemical surfactants - both can be toxic to humans and the environment.
Scalability: Effective, stable nanoparticles are prohibitively expensive to produce and cannot be manufactured to scale - inhibiting broad market adoption and limiting potential applications.

Mark Harris - Board Executive ChairmanScalable Product Supplier
Attostat’s patent-protected production process is fast and consistent, enabling reliable and scalable production.  The laser ablation process creates spherical nano material that is consistent and in size, shape and stable in suspension without the use of chemicals (i.e. surfactants). The result is specific-sized non-ionic nanoparticles produced at the necessary concentration to be effective in a given application.  It takes minutes to produce liters of material that can be stored and shipped without concern of particle agglomeration or fall-out.

The Process
Attostat’s laser ablation process establishes a new standard of production providing scalable manufacturing in order to meet consumer volume demands.  This process makes nanotechnology economically accessible to provide healing, protection and enhancements to your products in serving your consumers.
Step 1
Selecting and Purifying Material
Specific materials unique to the application desired are selected and put through a refining process to eliminate any impurities—insuring all materials are 100% pure.
Step 2
Breaking it Down
Attostat’s proprietary laser ablation production process breaks down elemental material to create spherical particles of a very specific size. The narrow size distribution is critical to the effectiveness and non-toxicity of the nanoparticles.
Step 3
Quality Control
verifies the size and shape of every sample with state-of-the-art analytic tools. Attostat’s narrow size distribution reduces waste, helping the environment and costs. Attostat’s perfectly round particles allow them to stay suspended in solution and don’t require any surfactants.
Step 4
Testing
Tests are done to check for effectiveness and safety. spends a significant amount time in research and development to discover new applications and ensure the safety of those products.
