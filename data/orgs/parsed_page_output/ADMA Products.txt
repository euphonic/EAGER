Our innovations are changing the face of the metals industry.
US
produces cost effective metal of the highest quality. We manufacture powder metallurgy from titanium, zirconium, niobium and other advanced materials and alloys.  Since 1985 has been at the forefront of advanced materials research and development.  We have taken our processes to a new level by developing aerospace approved powdered metallurgy titanium parts.  Our trademarked are better, lower cost and take less time to manufacture.
What Makes Us Unique
​
We start our low cost process by taking titanium tetrachloride and making hydrogenated titanium powder. Next we consolidate this powder with cost effective techniques, like room temperature die pressing, direct powder rolling and cold iso-static pressing.  Then we sinter the preforms into a fully dense product.  
Our final product has qualities that meet or exceed those of conventional ingot titanium.  We can make it faster and better.
Leading the Way in Advanced Material Powder Production

If you have any questions about our powders, please contact us today.  We are happy to discuss your specific requirements.
Hydrogenated Titanium Powder
Our patented hydrogenated titanium powder is remarkably low cost, high purity and is approved for critical applications.
Titanium Alloy Components
​
Starting from our hydrogenated titanium powder, we make these parts via low cost room temperature consolidation. This means that we can die press, cold isosatic press or direct power roll the powder and then sinter it immediately.  In other words, we avoid the enormous hassle of multiple vacuum melts, as needed by conventional ingot processing.
Our process saves costs and energy, all while meeting or exceeding and property requirements.
TiAl component for aircraft applications
Intermetallic Components
These Gamma Titanium Aluminides (TiAl) have been hailed because of their specific strength and stiffness, as well as their excellent corrosion, creep and oxidation resistance.  They are lighter than titanium alloys and can withstand much higher temperatures. 
Ask us about our innovative, cost-effective proprietary process for producing flat TiAl sheets.  We meet and exceed specification requirements at significantly lower costs than conventional ingot metallurgy.
Titanium Metal Matrix Composite Components (MMCs)

Ti Alloy Components from Pre-alloyed Powders
manufactures pre-alloyed powder metallurgy components for critical applications.  Our ti alloy parts are fully dense, cost-effective and have mechanical properties that match or exceed those of wrought titanium alloys.  In other words, they're higher quality at lower costs.
​
Pre-alloyed powder metallurgy ti alloy components have really picked up speed in the industry.  What sets apart is our know how for making very complicated shapes.  Ask us about how we can create the part to fit your needs.
Porous Media
makes porous plates, tubes and other porous media from titanium, zirconium, niobium, nickel, stainless steel and other metals. 
Our porous plates are perfect for: water cracking units, energy storage systems, water generation, water removal for dehumidifying systems and for cleaning fracking water that's been used in shale and oil production.  They are superb filters.
​
We've made life support systems for the Navy, Air Force and  Our technology can be used in ethanol production, natural gas dehydration, dehumidifiers, water distillation, water removal, water generation and purification, just to name a few of the possibilities.
Ask us about how we can fulfill your porous media needs.
PS/Powders and Components
Developed by scientists, coating powders and components are self-lubricating and can seal materials at very high heats. These bushings can handle trips to Venus, but we're equally impressed with what they can do here on Earth.
​
We believe these parts are the wave of the future and are pleased to produce them under license from Please ask us about our PM/Series 200, 300, 400 and how they can meet your high temperature needs.
