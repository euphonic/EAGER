Helping the world work smarter, play more spontaneously, and communicate more efficiently.
Our team of visionaries and trailblazers has redefined innovation — designing and building advanced memory and semiconductor technologies that transform what’s possible.
Our History of Innovation
Is Founded
started as a four-person semiconductor design company in the basement of a Boise, Idaho dental office. Micron’s first contract was for the design of a 64memory chip for Mostek Corporation.
Engineers Finalize 64Design
While not the first company to make 64DRAM, Micron’s engineers created a newer, smaller version that was lauded as the smallest 64design in the world. This innovative design led to high-volume manufacturing of the company’s first 64product in 1981.
Ships its First 64Product
Micron’s 64was the first product manufactured at the company’s newly completed fabrication facility in Boise, Idaho. sold its 64into many of the first mass-produced personal computers, including the Commodore 64 home computer.
Unveils World’s Smallest 256Chip
In addition to being introduced as the world’s smallest 256die, this chip also represented an industry milestone in density. By using bigger and easier-to-read memory cells, the 256was a springboard to future efficiency and profitability for the young memory startup.
Brings 1-Megabit to Market
milestone in density, the 1Mb became a staple for main memory in PCs and graphics cards during the late 1980s and 1990s. Micron’s 1Mb enabled high-capacity modules that supported PCs equipped with Microsoft’s new Windows OS.
Introduces First Video and Fast Static Products
The introductions of 256video and fast static broadened Micron’s product portfolio beyond traditional DRAM, enabling to become a player in differentiated memory types.
16-Megabit Enables PCs With New Windows 3.1
milestone in density, the 16-megabit replaced Micron's mainstay 4-megabit lineup. These higher capacity chips coincided with Microsoft’s release of Windows 3.1, which drove minimum requirements to 1 megabyte.
Produces Industry’s First DRAM
Micron’s demonstration of the Samurai double data rate (DDR) chipset proved that memory could deliver performance equivalent to the competing Direct solution, but at a much lower cost. Ultimately, would become the undisputed industry-standard interface for high-performance DRAM.
Micron's Quad Data Rate Doubles Memory Bandwidth
Micron’s innovative quad data rate (QDR) architecture effectively doubled the bandwidth for communication applications such as switches and routers. This unique design used two ports to independently run at a double data rate, resulting in four data items per clock cycle.
Demonstrates Industry's First 1Gigabit on 110nm Process
Micron’s 1Gb was built on the most advanced process in the world (110nm), outpacing semiconductor giants Intel and who were still on 130nm. This chip established as the memory industry leader in both density and interface performance.
Develops 1.3-Megapixel Image Sensor
Micron’s entry into image sensors established the company as an innovator capable of making with image quality rivaling charge coupled device (CCD) sensors. Today, sensors are the standard in digital cameras of all types, from smartphones to high-end professional gear.
Unveils Pseudo-Static for Cell Phones
Pseudo-Static (PSRAM) delivered the high bandwidth, capacity and low power necessary to replace in mobile devices. Micron’s leadership in paved the way for future low-power products that are used in mobile devices today.
Develops the Industry’s First 6F2 Cell
developed an entirely new 6F2 cell architecture to replace the industry’s 8F2 cell standard, enabling approximately 25% more bits per wafer. This higher-density design enabled to reclaim the title as the industry’s most cost-competitive memory producer.
Introduces High-Capacity, Low-Power Mobile LPDRAM
Micron’s 16— built on a tiny 33mm2 die — enabled higher capacity and lower power in a small footprint. As cell phones transitioned from simple voice to multimedia, requirements increased dramatically, a trend that continues in smartphones today.
Develops Mongoose Tester for Improved Accuracy, Lower Costs
This internally-developed tester is used exclusively by to increase test throughput and accuracy. continues to evolve this tester platform to meet new and future memory standards.
Unveils the World's Highest-Density Server Memory Module
Micron’s 16DDR2 module served the fast-growing server memory footprint of the 2000s as the rise of virtualization packed multiple applications onto single servers. These high-density server modules are a trend that continues today.
Develops Industry’s First Pitch-Doubled NAND
Pitch-doubling was introduced as a lithography technique for increasing bit density without a lithography change. This method involved the separation of bit lines into first and second metal layers, allowing to deliver a 16Gb device on existing 50nm technology.
Advances Low-Latency, Low-Power 2 Memory
Originally designed for networking, this high-performance quickly became the solution of choice for an unexpected application: DLP-based TVs and projectors. While density has increased over time, reduced latency remains a staple in networking applications today.
and Intel First to Deliver Sub-40nm Flash Memory
This multi-level cell (MLC) flash device was the industry’s first monolithic 32Gb NAND, which enabled high-density solid state storage in very small form factor devices, including digital cameras, personal music players and digital camcorders.
Ships RealSSD™ C300, Industry’s Fastest Client SSD
At the time of launch, the C300 was the industry’s fastest for notebook and desktop PCs. With support for the interface, this delivered 6 Gb/s which significantly boosted throughput speeds for data transfers, application loads and boot times.
and Intel Announce World’s First 20nm NAND
This 128Gb memory could store 1Tb of data in a single fingertip-size package with just eight die, setting a new storage benchmark. Additionally, this memory was the first to use an innovative planar cell structure that overcame the scaling constraints of standard floating-gate NAND.
Debuts Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) Architecture
Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) is a revolutionary architecture that combines high-speed logic with a stack of memory die using through-silicon via (TSV) technology. Learnings from continue to be applied towards future, emerging memory technologies.
Produces Industry’s First 2.5-Inch PCIe Enterprise SSD
This solution combined a high-performance Express interface with a hot-swappable 2.5-inch form factor and custom controller, creating new options for enterprise performance scalability and serviceability.
Creates New Low-Power Category for Ultrabook™  Devices
DDR3L-memory established a new category of “reduced-power” solutions, enabling longer battery life for a new generation of high-performance, ultrathin devices like laptops, tablets, and Ultrabook systems.
*Ultrabook is a trademark of Intel Corporation or its subsidiaries in the and/or other countries.
Delivers World’s Smallest 16nm Flash Device
Micron’s 16nm process delivered 16of storage on a single die, the highest-density planar flash memory ever developed. Using this process, a single 300mm wafer can create nearly 6of storage.
Leads Industry With First Monolithic 8Gb DDR3 SDRAM
This single component provided a significant density increase to 1 gigabyte on a single chip. This higher density enables cost-effective, high-capacity solutions optimized to support large-scale, data-intensive workloads.
and Intel Unveil 3NAND, the Highest-Density Flash Ever Developed
3marks a significant inflection point in the future of semiconductors. By stacking layers of data storage cells vertically, 3delivers three times higher capacity than planar technology.
and Intel Announce Breakthrough 3XPoint™ 3XPoint represents a major breakthrough in memory process and is the first new memory category in decades. This non-volatile memory is up to 1,000 times faster and has up to 1,000 times greater endurance than NAND.
