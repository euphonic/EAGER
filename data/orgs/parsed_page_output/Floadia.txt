provides scalable, cost effective and high quality eIPs.
All products share the concept of “LEE”, which stands for Low cost and Easily Embedded.
Products
products all use “tunneling” mechanism for program and erase operation, which will result in very low power therefore very short test time as you can program the whole memory area at once.
They also allow very short baking time to further cut cost down.
All of products are capable of handling high temperature for automotive grade requirement.
Low Cost solution for a few KBytes requirement.
Simple Low Cost Flash. Available in affordable 90nm foundry process.
Few masks and short test/bake.

The Beauty of SONOS
Floadia’s G1 and G2 are based on memory architecture, which has many advantages over widely used Split Gate memory architecture.
High Speed NV-RAM
Like no other embedded Flash solutions available today, Floadia’s G2 has very unique feature supporting “read operation” with VCC, where normally high voltage is required.
3. Targeting zero defect in Mass Production
Floadia's eproducts cover wide range of applications, from where the highest quality is required to the lowest power consumption is mandatory.
About is a team of experienced engineers who were developing embedded memory for more than 20 years.
Floadia’s development team comprises not only with memory engineers and circuit designers
but also people with deep knowledge in the manufacturing process and quality assurance to provide full range of service, like no other vendors.
