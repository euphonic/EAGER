welcome letter from Chairman, President and CEO, Ian Cook
As we head into 2018, Colgate will continue to care for the well-being of people and their families, be a steward for the planet and its resources and do business with the highest level of integrity.
Colgate People all around the world take pride in our and the business, social and environmental performance we deliver each year. They care about the future of our Company, the communities we serve, and the planet we share.
At the heart of our efforts are our commitments to our shared global values, ethical behavior, and ambitious sustainability goals that touch most everything we do. Our focus remains on five global sustainability commitments:
Helping Colgate People and Their Families Live Better
Contributing to the Communities Where We Live and Work
Delighting Consumers and Sustaining Our World With Our Brands
Making Every Drop of Water Count
Reducing Our Impact on Climate and the Environment
This report details our current progress and our commitments to future progress. am especially pleased to highlight developments in these three critical areas:
Water Conservation Colgate is uniquely positioned to lead in water conservation: Water is intrinsic to our products and how they are used. Conserving water reflects our value of Caring for people and the planet, as our brands, found in more households than any other in the world, are trusted by billions of people. So we have both an extraordinary opportunity – and a clear duty – to help preserve this vital resource. Momentum is building around our #EveryDropCounts campaign, and this year we will reach people in 70+ countries with engaging messages to turn off the tap when brushing.
Palm Oil We recognize our responsibility to work with industry groups, suppliers, governments and others to ensure we source palm oil and its derivatives in ways that do not damage the environment or exploit workers. Our goal is to reach 100 percent sustainable palm oil which we expect to achieve in 2018. This year we also expect to disclose 100 percent of the mills that supply us directly from our four largest palm oil suppliers, which together account for more than 80 percent of our purchases. Looking ahead, we will extend this program to additional suppliers as we work toward our goal of full disclosure and traceability.
Plastic Packaging Plastics can contribute to environmental concerns, including pollution of the world’s oceans. We are committed to reducing our use of plastic in our packaging, using more recycled plastic, and increasing the recyclability of our plastic packaging. We have made significant progress, including reducing our use of plastics – 98 percent of our packaging is free of this hard-to-recycle plastic. Now we have raised the bar with a new commitment: 100 percent recyclability of the plastic we use in our packaging across all categories by 2025.
am grateful to all the Colgate People who contribute to our sustainability success year after year, as well as to the suppliers and other partners we work with to achieve our goals. Our progress is being recognized; including placement on the Water List and Climate List, making the highest ranked based in our industry.
Together, we are Building a Future to Smile About
Thank you,

Save Water
Water conservation starts at home.
We use water every day when we brush our teeth, bathe or shower, wash our hands and wash dishes. Together let’s make every drop of water count. By making small changes, we can have a big impact!
Brush for 2 minutes twice a day, but turn off the faucet
The American Dental Association recommends brushing your teeth for two minutes twice a day. Turning off the faucet while brushing your teeth can save up to 3,000 gallons of water per year – that’s the equivalent of 50,000 glasses of water!
Reduce showers by 2 minutes
Reducing your shower by 2 minutes saves both water and energy. In one year, you can save up to 1,800 gallons of water and enough energy to power a 13-watt compact fluorescent light bulb for approximately 2 years.
Turn off the faucet while washing the dishes
Turning off the faucet when washing the dishes by hand for two minutes saves both water and energy. In one year, you can save up to 1,600 gallons of water and enough energy to charge a cell phone for almost 3 years.
Turn off the faucet when washing hands
Turning off the faucet for 10 seconds while washing your hands can save both water and energy. In one year, you can save up to 400 gallons of water and enough energy to power a 13-watt compact fluorescent light bulb for over 2 months.
