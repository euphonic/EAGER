is an engineering research and development firm that specializes in finding innovative, streamlined solutions for fluid-related industrial problems. PAX's streamlined technologies offer improved equipment design with streamlined fluid movement that provides competitive market advantages:
better      management of turbulence and reduced friction and drag
reduced noise      and increased energy efficiency for fluid-handling equipment
improved heat      transfer and reduced pressure for thermal management products
has licensed a number of companies to commercialize these technologies. There are several ways to work with companies to achieve these benefits:
Joint      development programs allow clients to work closely with our engineering      team to achieve desired improvements in the application. The clients can      then license the resulting design.
For      established applications designs, we consider exclusive and master      licenses on a case-by-case basis. We also work with the licensees to      optimize the application's design to their specifications.
For certain      applications, we identify strategic investment or corporate partners to      launch market-specific subsidiaries or joint venture companies to      commercialize technology designs.
