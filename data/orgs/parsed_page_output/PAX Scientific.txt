is a fluid
dynamics research and design firm. 
Our understanding of natural
fluid flow allows us to design industrial equipment and other technologies that
are highly efficient and innovative. We then license these designs to
manufacturers in a variety of industries.
Copyright, Scientific, Inc.  All rights reserved.  |   415-256-9900   |   is an engineering research and development firm that specializes in finding innovative, streamlined solutions for fluid-related industrial problems. PAX's streamlined technologies offer improved equipment design with streamlined fluid movement that provides competitive market advantages:
better      management of turbulence and reduced friction and drag
reduced noise      and increased energy efficiency for fluid-handling equipment
improved heat      transfer and reduced pressure for thermal management products
has licensed a number of companies to commercialize these technologies. There are several ways to work with companies to achieve these benefits:
Joint      development programs allow clients to work closely with our engineering      team to achieve desired improvements in the application. The clients can      then license the resulting design.
For      established applications designs, we consider exclusive and master      licenses on a case-by-case basis. We also work with the licensees to      optimize the application's design to their specifications.
For certain      applications, we identify strategic investment or corporate partners to      launch market-specific subsidiaries or joint venture companies to      commercialize technology designs.
The company
Scientific's focus is research and development of intellectual property related to the Streamlining Principle as well as support of its subsidiaries:
Fan commercializes Scientific's fan designs in the industrial, domestic, computer, and automotive markets.
Water Technologies  commercializes technologies for water and wastewater management.
Mixer markets industrial mixing technologies (other than water or wastewater mixers), and researches atmospheric mixing.

Most fluid-handling devices (fans, mixers, pumps, turbines, propellers), as well as those that move through fluids (boat hulls and aircraft fuselages) face significant limitations, such as drag resistance, low output, inefficient energy usage, excessive noise, or component wear. The Streamlining Principle  employs natural flow geometries to improve upon these existing limitations and provide the following benefits:
Increased Efficiency: Decreased      noise, increased output, decreased power usage
Optimized Flow Pattern: Drag      reduction, controlled directional thrust/flow, low shear/cavitation
Decreased Manufacturing and      Maintenance Cost: Optimized material usage, reduced motor size,      increased structural integrity
Our R&team studies the fundamental mathematics and fluid dynamics underlying the Streamlining Principle  using both numerical methods and analysis. We also use in-house and external experimental testing by independent research facilities to validate our methods and ensure that performance is fully optimized.  We then optimize streamlining geometries for targeted fluid-handling applications.
Through PAX’s subsidiaries, we are currently commercializing the following technologies:
