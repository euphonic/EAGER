Digital Policies Matter
They matter because digital transformation is changing the way we work, do business and live in a more fundamental way than the previous waves of digitalization. We are at a point where cloud computing, internet of everything, gigabit connectivity, wireless technologies, artificial intelligence, big data are becoming pervasive and truly transformational. They matter because government regulations, public investments and procurement decisions determine the success of this transformation and shape the business environment. 
We at Huawei aspire to help support better digital policy making with evidence, analysis, and technology insights. We believe that governments and businesses should engage in strategic partnerships to make digital transformation a success for all. This Website is a contribution to this partnership. Here we will increasingly share our knowledge, studies, best practices from around the world, industry opinion and provide tools.
This section will cover a range of policy issues, amongst them:
Mobile Communication, Spectrum, 5G
investment, innovation and competition

Huawei is a leading global provider of information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure and smart devices. With integrated solutions across four key domains – telecom networks, IT, smart devices, and cloud services – we are committed to bringing digital to every person, home and organization for a fully connected, intelligent world.
Huawei's end-to-end portfolio of products, solutions and services are both competitive and secure. Through open collaboration with ecosystem partners, we create lasting value for our customers, working to empower people, enrich home life, and inspire innovation in organizations of all shapes and sizes.
At Huawei, innovation focuses on customer needs. We invest heavily in basic research, concentrating on technological breakthroughs that drive the world forward. We have more than 180,000 employees, and we operate in more than 170 countries and regions. Founded in 1987, Huawei is a private company fully owned by its employees.
What do we offer the world?
We create value for our customers. Together with telecom carriers, Huawei has built more than 1,500 networks, helping connect over one-third of the world’s population. Together with our partners, we serve government and public utilities, as well as enterprise customers in sectors like finance, energy, transportation, and manufacturing. We help organizations and industries go digital by providing them with open, flexible, and secure infrastructure platforms that promote greater synergy between devices, networks, and the cloud. We also provide enterprise customers with stable, reliable, and secure cloud services that evolve with their needs. With our smartphones and other smart devices, we are improving people’s digital experience in work, life, and entertainment.
We promote industry development. Huawei advocates openness, collaboration, and shared success. Through joint innovation with our customers, partners, and peers, we are expanding the value of information and communications technology in service of a more robust and symbiotic industry ecosystem. Huawei is an active member of more than 360 standards organizations, industry alliances, and open source communities, where we work together on mainstream standards and lay the foundation for shared success. We have also joined forces with industry partners to innovate in emerging domains like cloud computing, software-defined networking (SDN), network functions virtualization (NFV), and 5Together, we are driving the industry forward.
We drive economic growth. Huawei generates tax revenues, provides local employment opportunities, and stimulates the development of the value chain in every country where we operate. Furthermore, we deliver innovative solutions that drive the digital transformation of all industries, fostering economic growth and greatly improving quality of life.
We enable sustainable development. As a responsible corporate citizen, Huawei has made a significant contribution to bridging the digital divide, leaving our mark in places as remote as Mount Everest and the Arctic Circle. We are keenly aware of the importance of telecommunications in emergency response situations. Having faced Ebola-affected areas in West Africa, nuclear contamination after the Japanese tsunami, and the massive earthquake that struck Sichuan, China, we hold fast to restore communications networks and ensure the reliable operation of essential telecoms equipment in disaster zones. To further promote sustainability, we prioritize low-carbon and environmental protection throughout all planning, design, R&D, manufacturing, delivery, and O&activities, providing our customers with top-of-the-line products and solutions that save energy and reduce environmental impact. As for people, we help develop the next generation of local talent with our global Seeds for the Future program, where we work with young talent across 108 countries and regions to transfer knowledge, cultivate understanding and greater interest in the industry, and encourage broader involvement in the digital community.
We provide dedicated people with a strong growth platform. Inspiring dedication is one of Huawei’s core values, and it manifests itself in many ways. We assess employees and select managers based on their contribution, as well as the extent of their responsibilities. We provide our teams with a global development platform, giving young team members the opportunity to shoulder greater responsibilities and accelerate their careers. In this way, we have enabled over 100,000 Huawei people to yield ample returns and gain memorable life experience.
What do we stand for?
For the past 30 years we have maintained an unwavering focus, rejecting shortcuts and easy opportunities that don't align with our core business. With a practical approach to everything we do, we concentrate our efforts and invest patiently to drive technological breakthroughs. This strategic focus is a reflection of our core values: staying customer-centric, inspiring dedication, persevering, and growing by reflection.
The digital era has been generous. We will make the most of this historic opportunity, and boldly forge ahead to build a fully connected, intelligent world.
