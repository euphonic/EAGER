Our Vision
To create fun, lasting experiences for everyone in the world through our products and services.
Happy Consumers
Creative and professional teams delivers innovative, functional and exceptional products with the goal of bringing fun and memorable user experiences to consumers.
Happy Employees
Create a work environment in which our employees can develop their skills, build their careers and cultivate and pursue their professional interests.
Happy World
Emphasis on corporate sustainability and aim to minimize the impact on the environment.  Actively investing in and pursuing more efficient alternative energy sources and material recycling initiatives.
Recycling
Whether post-production scraps or post-consumer returns, we collect all scrap material. Using our in-house machinery, we sort, grind, wash and separate the returned products or process scraps into pellets which can be reused in our manufacturing.
We are committed to continuous improvement in technical knowledge, automation, and mechanization in the manufacturing system with an eye to always maximize our production efficiency.
Our manufacturing plant in Nantong boasts 23,000 square meters of solar panels, generating 4 million 700,000 kwh of electricity, equivalent to about 8% of our annual energy consumption at our Nantong plant. Plans to continue to expand the roof area for new installation of solar panels are in the works.
In 2016, we participated in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). Alongside 5,600 suppliers worldwide we reported our current energy use, carbon emissions and projects implemented to improve our company footprint. was awarded the "Best China Supplier" for our energy related efforts among 400 Chinese manufacturers who participated in CDP’s report and program. www.cdp.net
product safety compliance managers in Shanghai, Europe, and North America are actively involved with European and American Standards Committees.
We participate in drafting technical and safety standards for above ground pool and spas with the European Standardization Committee. Safety requirements for all of our products comply with international and regional laws and regulations, and obtain the test report and certifications issued by a qualified third party international professional testing organizations, such as GS, or ETL.
Our central laboratory in Shanghai has played a key role in ensuring the safety of our products. It has received a number of domestic and international accreditation and certifications such as:
• National Accreditation Board of China
• TÜRheinland group (International Electrotech nical Commission) customer testing laboratory for electrical product safety
• Consumer Product Safety Commission's firewall third party testing laboratory
We have the only laboratory in China that has received all of the above approvals.
Retention
Happy employees are the driving force of Bestway’s successful operations. We value our employees and create an environment in which employees are able to develop their talents and pursue their professional passions. And it shows. This is especially true in China, where our manufacturing facilities are located in our sites in Shanghai, and Nantong and Yancheng in the Jiangsu province in the inland eastern region of China, all within driving distance of each other in the Yangtze River Delta region and within driving distance of each other along the same highway for efficiency and logistical purposes. Up until recently, it was the norm for Chinese workers to migrate to cities such as Shanghai and Beijing only to return inland to their homes for the Chinese New Year. This "tide of return" began after the 2009 financial crisis, during which approximately 20 million migrant workers found themselves without work and were forced to return home. Since then, stimulus packages including investment in inland transportation development and increases in employment opportunities have made large interior cities increasingly attractive places to work for people from those regions, since they no longer need to make the personal sacrifices of leaving their families too far behind. With these incentives in place, has attracted more employees to retain over the past five years. Add that to the important fact that believes in promoting from within and you have a recipe for successful and happy employees.

Solar Sustainability
In addition to recycling, utilizes one of the largest resources available to aid in creating more energy efficient manufacturing processes – the sun. Solar electricity is green, renewable, and doesn’t release any harmful carbon dioxide or other pollutants. We installed 23,000 square meters of solar panels in the rooftop of our manufacturing facility in Nantong, which generated 4.7 million kilowatt-hour of energy,which is equivalent to approximately 8 % of the annual energy consumption of our Nantong manufacturing facility. We plan to install 22,000 square meters of solar panels in our manufacturing facilities in Nantong by September 2017.
Sustainability
In 2016, we participated in a public disclosure program organized by Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP’) by reporting our sustainability efforts along with over 5,600 manufacturers globally, including information on energy use, emissions and wastes.
We were awarded the Best Chinese Supplier on climate change measures. Approximately 400 Chinese manufacturers participated in the program and reported their sustainability efforts, with over 5,625 companies responding in 2015. www.cdp.net .
