WithdrawalAbout research
Notable research
At Bosch, research forms the basis of our products and services. That means it plays a key role in the success of the brand.
Check out some of the milestones in the history of Research
Research has a long tradition at Bosch. The first patent filed under the name of was issued in 1897 for an oscillating sleeve for the company’s magneto ignition device. Early on, and his colleagues made a commitment to deliver outstanding levels of quality. They made their mark by identifying the latest trends and manufacturing new products from core technologies.
Ever since our company was founded, we have sought to play our part in making the world a better place, one small step at a time. Our conduct and business activities are guided by a brand promise: even before we create a product, we will always put an emphasis on quality in our research and in the results of that research. We understand that conducting research involves a responsibility to both our partners and the wider world, and we endeavor to fulfil that responsibility at all times. That’s how we create inspiring products. And that’s how we create technology “Invented for life”.
We conduct research in an international network
Our goal is to forge alliances with the best research institutes around the world. In addition, every location is expected to act as a kind of radar for Research by scanning its respective region to detect megatrends.
Our worldwide research and advance engineering locations
Currently, 12 locations actively contribute to Corporate Research. Each location fulfils a specific role.
Boston
Boston
The Research Center in Cambridge, MA, is where our engineers develop cutting-edge methods for modern and future technology. We are located in Kendall Square, which Boston Consulting Group called "the most innovative square mile on the planet." In close proximity to Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology, we also collaborate with top research groups at these world-renowned universities.
The Research and Technology Center in Bangalore, India, is part of the international Corporate Research community dedicated to using technological innovations to solve the problems of tomorrow. Here, the associates investigate various challenges on the path toward a connected, smart, and energy-efficient tomorrow. We focus our research along three main themes: advanced data analytics for Ioapplications, computer vision and numerical methods, and algorithms for real-time embedded systems. Our research solutions and prototypes not only cater to the wider global business but also focus on solving regional challenges pertaining to India. Our main motivation comes from our belief that the technologies we develop today will enable the products necessary for achieving a smarter, better connected, and more energy-efficient future.

Moscow
Moscow
The headquarters in Russia is sustained in the best traditions of the company, with every centimeter literally breathing "Invented for life."

Our business sectors
Mobility Solutions
Mobility Solutions
Its main areas of activity are injection technology and powertrain peripherals for internal-combustion engines, diverse solutions for powertrain electrification, steering systems, safety and driver-assistance systems, technology for user-friendly infotainment as well as vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, repair-shop concepts, and technology and services for the automotive aftermarket. The sector combines the group’s expertise in three mobility domains — automation, electrification, and connectivity — and offers its customers integrated mobility solutions that allow cars to interact with other means of transportation such as bicycles, trains, and buses. At the beginning of 2018, the sector restructured itself by bringing its Gasoline Systems and Diesel Systems divisions, as well as the electromobility unit, together under one roof in a new Powertrain Solutions division. This will allow it to serve its customers with the optimum combination of technologies, since even with electrification increasing, efficient gasoline and diesel engines will continue to play a significant role for a long time to come. In addition, the newly-formed Connected Mobility Solutions division brings together the connected mobility solutions and services that had previously been spread across various units within the Mobility Solutions business sector.
Industrial Technology
Industrial Technology
The sector includes the Drive and Control Technology division, whose portfolio includes customized drive, control, and linear motion solutions for factory automation, plant construction and engineering, and mobile machinery. It also offers a comprehensive range of services, carries out large-scale international projects, and is a leading user and provider of connected manufacturing solutions. The Packaging Technology division provides process and packaging solutions for the pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs industries. Its range includes stand-alone machines, systems solutions, and an extensive service portfolio. In addition, the new Connected Industry business unit has been part of the Industrial Technology business sector since the start of 2018. It combines the software development and projects relating to Industry 4.0 that had previously been spread across different units.
Consumer Goods
Consumer Goods
Its Power Tools division is a supplier of power tools, power-tool accessories, and measuring technology. In addition to power tools such as hammer drills, cordless screwdrivers, and jigsaws, its comprehensive product portfolio also includes gardening equipment such as lawnmowers, hedge trimmers, and high-pressure cleaners. One of the division’s focal points is convenient, high-performance cordless tools, and increasingly also web-enabled tools and services. The Consumer Goods business sector also includes Hausgeräte GmbH, which offers a broad range of modern, energy-efficient, and increasingly connected household appliances. Its product portfolio ranges from washing machines and tumble dryers through refrigerators and freezers, stoves and ovens, and dishwashers, to small appliances such as vacuum cleaners, coffee makers, and food processors.
Energy and Building Technology
Energy and Building Technology
Its Building Technologies division (formerly Security Systems) has two areas of business: the global product business for innovative security and communications solutions, and the regional integrator business. The latter offers solutions and services for building security, energy efficiency, and building automation in selected countries. Both units focus on commercial applications. The product portfolio encompasses video-surveillance, intrusion-detection, and voice-alarm systems, access-control and software management systems, as well as professional audio, conference, and fire-detection systems. The Thermotechnology division supplies energyefficient heating products and hot-water solutions, primarily in Europe. With a view to functions such as remote diagnosis, webenabled devices are becoming increasingly important. The Global Service Solutions division offers outsourcing for business processes and services. Within Bosch, it also provides shared-service functions. Smart Home brings Bosch’s smart-home products and services together under one roof, including the associated systems and software expertise.
 Ownership structure and organization 
 Since 1964, Bosch’s majority shareholder has been Stiftung GmbH, a charitable foundation. The Stiftung carries on the charitable and social endeavors of the company founder in contemporary form. It sees itself as a foundation that pursues its objectives both with programs and institutions of its own, and by supporting suitable projects and initiatives proposed by others for tackling the tasks faced by society.

Spotting trends, improving existing products, and coming up with new ideas – this seems the best way to sum up the successful strategy that is the common thread running through the history of research and development at Bosch. It applies to the company’s very first product, the magneto ignition device, which would never have been successfully installed in a motor vehicle without the ingenuity of the people working in the new company. The specialists working for Bosch’s chief engineer Gottlob Honold came up with many technological highlights that paved the way for the company’s success.
Research and development provide the technical basis for overcoming the major challenges of the future.
Volkmar Denner
1886 - 1900
Courtyard trials – Early days in the workshop
Everybody starts out small. Things were no different for in November 1886. With just one master craftsman and an errand boy, the “Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering” was a modest little affair in a courtyard-entrance building in Stuttgart. What we now envisage as research and development was practically unimaginable back then. At that time, did not have its own product portfolio, so there was not even a starting point for research and development activities. As far as business was concerned, would later describe this period as “a shambles”. Individual orders kept his head above water. In 1897 however, the company had already applied for its first patent – an oscillating sleeve for magneto ignition devices.
1901 – 1925
Honold’s spark of genius – First steps
After a series of ups and downs, the small company run by gradually expanded its workforce to 37 by 1900. built his first factory the following year, creating space for 200 associates in a modern reinforced concrete building complete with ventilation systems and large windows. However, the new factory did not yet include a research and development department. had 200 associates by 1904 and as many as 1,000 by 1908. This rapid growth was all thanks to the high-voltage magneto ignition system for motor vehicles, developed by Gottlob Honold, his first chief engineer. It was Honold as well who drew the logo still used today, the double-armature, in 1918. In addition to absolute thoroughness and an early promise of uncompromising quality, and his associates distinguished themselves above all by recognizing trends and creating new products from basic technologies.
1926 - 1932
More irons in the fire – New businesses
When Walter Dorn began work in the physics department of the senior laboratory team in 1924, he wondered “why wanted me at all. In my naivety, thought physicists were there to invent things. But everything was making had already been invented. So why did they need another physicist?” But they did in fact need physicists, because was then facing a period of profound upheaval. The sales crisis in the automotive market in 1925-1926 led to diversify its products. In this context, a department was established in 1930 to clarify “through preliminary investigations” which new products were suitable for inclusion in the company’s production program.
1933 - 1945
Troubled times
At first, research and development activities barely changed at all under the Nazi dictatorship. was able to continue its development projects in its established lines of business. But it was not long before the Nazi regime’s military plans began to have an impact on a number of research and development activities at Bosch, including gasoline injection for aircraft engines and television technology.
1946 - 1964
Venturing into the unknown – From stop-gap products to electronics
The Allied victory in the spring of 1945 ended the reign of terror imposed by the Nazi regime in Germany. Every helping hand available was needed and at first, the primary goal was to simply produce very simple products. It was essentially the development of individual semiconductor elements as the first electronic components for the automotive sector at the end of the 1950s that paved the way for a promising new area of business.
1965 - 1982
On solid ground – Reorganization
The 1960s brought fundamental changes for Bosch. With the company growing rapidly, the old centralized structure was replaced by the division-based organization still in place today. These far-reaching changes were also evident in more concrete terms. By 1964, the site in Stuttgart had become far too small and decided to relocate corporate headquarters and corporate research activities to a building complex on the “Schillerhöhe”, a wooded ridge around ten kilometers from the city center. This complex was completed in 1969. The innovations of the 1960s and 1970s, such as Jetronic and the anti-lock braking system, fitted in very well with a leitmotif for the development work that issued under the pressure of the first global oil crisis in 1973, namely to make driving safe, clean, and economical.
1983 - 2005
Developed for every market – Groundbreaking innovations and globalization
During the last two decades of the millennium, researchers and developers were confronted with an increasingly rapid pace of development across the globe. responded to the challenges this posed with technologies to meet new customer needs, a global R&organization, new focal areas such as micromechanics, and new future-proof approaches in established areas, such as common-rail diesel injection. In 1983, for example, the system, short for “Electronic Traffic Pilot for Motorists”, which laid the foundations for today’s vehicle navigation, was presented to the public. In autumn 1993, the Central Research and Advance Engineering Division, now known as Corporate Research, was established. There, research was to begin as usual with brainstorming and, if possible, end with prototype production before it was transferred to the respective division to start volume production.
2006 - 2015
Into the connected world – Energy efficiency and connectivity
When it comes to demonstrating the importance research and development has assumed at over the last four decades, the statistics speak for themselves. Between 1970 and 2000, the R&budget increased roughly 15-fold, and its share of sales rose from 5.4 to roughly 8 percent. And since 1970, the total number of associates across all areas of research and development has increased from 5,500 to 59,000. Today, it is more and more a matter of presenting the right ideas and products derived from correctly identified megatrends and not developing them without social or technological prospects for the future. The Research and Advance Engineering Center in Renningen near Stuttgart, which opened in 2015, also illustrates the innovative orientation of the company and provides creativity with room to grow, along with guidelines for the development of market-oriented products – so that an idea can really be developed into a success story! With the founding of the Center for Artificial Intelligence in 2017, was again preparing to meet the new challenges of the future.

More detailed information about the development of employment figures can be found at our annual report 2017, p.45ff.
102-9 Supply chain
Climate change and the scarcity of finite resources are among the challenges that faces within the framework of its sustainability management activities, which involve all levels of the supply chain. These levels include procurement, research and development, production, order processing, distribution logistics, sales and marketing, and aftersales.
Two examples: In production, the company’s global CO2 target and 14001 certifications ensure that locations continuously improve their environmental performance. In aftersales, the successful eXchange reprocessing program contributes to improving the company’s carbon footprint throughout the product life cycle. Used car parts are industrially refurbished, and 2.5 million parts are reinstalled each year. As a result, 23,000 tons of CO2 can be saved compared with the production of new components.
Wherever possible, also influences its stakeholders’ sustainability activities. With targeted product information and the sale of energy efficient products, the company helps its customers save energy. By the same token, involves its business partners in sustainability management: contracts include environmental standards that has defined. also promotes the environmental awareness of its suppliers with training seminars.
Social issues related to the supply chain are another aspect of sustainability that is committed to, among them the consistent observance of labor rights and occupational safety standards. meets these challenges in several ways, for instance by making its “Code of Business Conduct” and “Principles of Social Responsibility at Bosch” mandatory for suppliers. This includes respecting human rights, ensuring wage negotiations, rejecting forced and child labor, fighting discrimination in the workplace, and preventing corruption.
As a result of the high number of suppliers and subcontractors, is unable to monitor and control all parts of the supply chain. Since does not have any contractual agreement with subcontractors, it does not have any legal recourse. However, the company does instruct its suppliers to raise awareness among subcontractors and demand that they respect certain standards (written agreements, Quality Assurance Agreement (QAA)).
102-10 Significant changes to the organization and its supply chain
Year on year, changes in the consolidated group affected sales to the tune of some 140 million euros. They relate especially to Engineering, which was consolidated for the whole of 2017. The sale of the Starter Motors and Generators division will not have an impact on revenue figures until 2018.
102-11 Precautionary Principle or approach
102-16 Values, principles, standards, and norms of behavior
With comprehensive sustainability management and clear responsibilities, ensures that sustainability is a firmly established part of the company’s approach to doing business. In addressing sustainability-related topics, three bodies cooperate closely with one another:
1. The sustainability office is run by the Group’s sustainability experts. It is in charge of identifying the topics that are relevant for the company and recommending measures accordingly. In addition to this, the office handles internal and external queries and stays in touch with important stakeholders and organizations, such as Transparency International, the econsense Forum, and the Compliance and Integrity Forum.
2. The sustainability council addresses the stakeholders’ CSR-related questions and discusses their relevance for Bosch. On this basis, it develops recommendations for the steering committee. In addition to this, it evaluates the sustainability office’s work. The council comprises the heads of corporate departments such as purchasing, production, and environment, as well as the heads of various divisions.
3. The chairman of the board of management sits on the sustainability steering committee, as do other members of upper management and permanent members of the sustainability council. The committee ensures that the Group’s strategic direction maintains the right balance between economic, ecological, and social topics. In addition, it sets sustainability-related focal points and targets for the specialist departments and divisions. During an annual management review, the steering committee assesses whether set targets have been met.

102-40 List of stakeholder groups
The commitment to a healthy social environment is based on its special ownership structure, which differs from other companies: the Stiftung holds a 92 percent stake in the share capital of GmbThe foundation is thus a decisive stakeholder, and share dividend it receives is used exclusively for charitable purposes. In other words, with its long-term profit-oriented business strategy, provides the funding for the Stiftung’s social projects. There are representatives of the family and the Stiftung on the supervisory board of GmbH.
Other important stakeholders for include:
Associates
Customers
Suppliers
Other stakeholders include people who live in the surroundings of locations worldwide, politicians, non-governmental organizations in the environmental and social sectors, banks, insurance companies, the media, churches, as well as the representatives of public authorities. Wherever needed, engages in discussions and exchanges with these stakeholders.

102-41 Collective bargaining agreements
In Germany, the majority of employees are covered through collective and works agreements.
102-42 Identifying and selecting stakeholders
See 102-40.
102-43 Approach to stakeholder engagement
Via its sustainability office, actively participates in a number of committees to make sure that sustainability-related topics are addressed and that measures are developed accordingly. For instance, in 2015, the company contributed to revising the 14001 standard. What is more, representatives also delivered keynote speeches, moderated workshops, and acted as panelists at several international sustainability conferences. is also an active member of business associations such as econsense and It is also a member of Transparency International, the Compliance and Integrity Forum, and of the Global Compact. also supports the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) as a Gold Member.
Associates – exchanges take place through ongoing dialogs and regular feedback meetings with supervisors. In addition to this, conducts a global associate survey every two years. Among other things, the associates are surveyed about their working conditions, the extent to which they identify with the company’s values, and the balance between their personal and professional lives.
Customers – has intensive and regular exchanges with its automotive industry customers, who show a high interest in sustainability-related topics. We are involved in a number of joint ventures, especially in the area of automated driving, for instance with Daimler AG.
Suppliers – We conduct contract negotiations as well as environmental and social audits (see 4) with many of our suppliers. We also discuss environmental and social topics with them. For example, we cooperated with four other companies to found the Resproject in China, which is funded by the Germany Ministry of Education and Research. The aim was to systematically reduce our suppliers’ use of resources. In addition to comprehensive analyses and the resulting measures, the cooperation included training sessions on topics such as resource efficiency and safety in the workplace.
Universities and research institutes – Here, supports research in areas that are relevant for the company, including energy efficiency, renewable energies, and powertrain electrification. At the same time, offers students and graduates opportunities to write their bachelor’s or master’s theses, or even their Phdissertations on practical sustainability-related topics.

Currently the report content does not meet the requirements of the standards completely. gradual approach towards the standard is planned for the near future.
102-47 List of material topics
With the help of a comprehensive analysis, defines the dimensions of sustainability upon which its activities are based. It applies a management system approach that examines and assesses all sustainability-related topics. For each dimension under examination, the analysis assesses whether a global policy is in place, as well as whether there are measurable targets, suitable indicators, and topic-specific training measures. Moreover, the analysis examines the extent to which each dimension plays a role in external reporting.
The analysis is part of comprehensive assessments conducted in cooperation with the respective specialist departments. The results are then evaluated in cooperation with the sustainability office. On this basis, the sustainability council recommends potential focal points and sustainability targets, which the sustainability steering committee then approves.
The following graph shows which dimensions and its stakeholders consider relevant within the context of the defined areas of activity.

Focus and Strategy
At Bosch, reliability, credibility, responsibility, fairness, and legality are the main pillars of success.
We promise only what we can deliver, accept agreements as binding, and respect and observe the law in all our business transactions" says the company’s "We are Bosch” mission statement. To underscore the importance of this maxim, the company has clearly summarized its commitment to meeting legal requirements in its "Code of Business Conduct”. Since 2008, the Code of Business Conduct has set the rules of behavior for all business transactions.
also has a global compliance management system (CMS) with a chief compliance officer, who reports directly to the board of management, a central compliance department, as well as compliance officers at the divisions and in the different regions. There are also other departments that focus on compliance-related issues.
has a comprehensive compliance training program that is accessible to all associates and mandatory for some. With its Compliance Dialog , has introduced a tool that enables a regular and open exchange between supervisors and their associates on compliance-related topics.Other preventive measures include job rotation in sensitive areas, internal control processes, as well as monitoring procedures. Internal audits are also conducted on a regular basis.
What is more, has a global whistleblower system. In addition to speaking directly to their supervisors or the compliance department, associates can also report violations – even anonymously – at any time. Business partners and third parties can also do this. Incoming reports go to the compliance department, which follows up on them.
To communicate the importance of responsible and legal behavior beyond the walls of the company, has also formulated a code of conduct for suppliers.
revises its on a regular basis to ensure that its own rules and processes meet new legal and technical requirements in a rapidly changing environment. These revisions include risk analysis and, wherever necessary, defining and introducing the corresponding measures. What is more, began compliance assessments of its business partners in 2017. Wherever irregularities are detected, appropriate measures are taken.
has been a member of Transparency International since 1995, and was the first corporate member of Transparency International Germany.

Approach for sustainable production
is meeting this challenge by, among other things, having concrete sustainability goals, using the "Design for Environment" approach to sustainable product design, taking environmental measures at locations (e.g. the successful introduction of environmental management systems at all plants), and consistently monitoring our sustainability activities.
At Bosch, environmental monitoring is coordinated by the department for health, fire and environmental safety. Experts gather and evaluate the key figures on site. In its observations on water supply, for example, distinguishes between the public supply and its own water supply. As regards waste, the company looks separately at waste for recycling, waste for disposal, construction waste, and hazardous waste. Our figures on energy requirements are broken down by energy sources: electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, liquefied gas, district heating, coal, coke, and renewable sources. To systematically conserve energy and resources in line with understanding of sustainability, we consider the environmental impact of our business activity throughout the entire product lifecycle - from the development phases to recycling potential.
Product development
products across all divisions have continuously become more eco-friendly in recent years. The systematic "Design for Environment" (DfE) approach has contributed significantly to this success. Since its introduction in 2000, has made it a rule to optimize products in the development process based on four key criteria:
How can the consumption of energy and raw materials be reduced (energy and raw material efficiency)?
Can emissions and immissions be reduced (emissions and immissions efficiency)?
Can the amount of materials used be reduced, and can materials that are less harmful to the environment be used (materials efficiency)?
How can maintenance be improved (waste management efficiency)?
The aim of Dfis to improve a product in environmental terms over the course of its life cycle. Specially trained Dfcoordinators advise and support the respective units on meeting current requirements to ensure environmentally sound product development. Meanwhile, a training module with comprehensive documentation for seminars and self-study programs ensures that associates involved in product development (e.g. from purchasing, development and distribution) have the requisite background knowledge.
The environment and safety portfolio is another sustainability-related feature at Bosch. It comprises products and services that contribute to protecting the environment and conserving resources. It also includes products that promote good health or contribute to making life safer. Before products are included in the environment and security portfolio, internal environmental experts test them according to a set of specific criteria and sustainability indicators. Each year, increases spending on research and development for its environmental and safety (54 percent of R&expenditure in 2017). The share of total sales is also calculated and published in the sustainability report (41 percent share of group sales in 2017).
Procurement
In 2012, began to expand its definition of environmentally sound design. The goal is to uncouple growth and resource consumption. As sales rise, aims to systematically reduce the relative amount of raw materials used. To this end, the company is active in the Resource Alliance, an industry-funded exchange and consultancy platform that analyses developments in raw materials markets, among other things. Using scenario analysis, the Resource Alliance supports participating companies with evaluating future developments and their impacts and developing appropriate solutions.
Production
Economical and sustainable use of natural resources not only makes ecological sense. Globalization has made the raw materials used in industry scarcer and, as a result, more expensive. In order to systematically conserve resources, an environmental management system operating to 14001 standards has been introduced at all locations. During implementation, various local best-practice initiatives emerged, which have been shared with the entire community environment Wiki and created several imitators. has also defined sustainability management rules and processes for its suppliers. All contracts with suppliers make observance of the International Labor Organization’s (ILO) core labor standards and general environmental standards mandatory. These include, for instance, bans on the use of environmentally hazardous substances, and obligations to declare. monitors whether suppliers are aware of and complying with these requirements through supplier audits. It also expects its 500 preferred suppliers to apply a certified environmental management system.
also has detailed knowledge of the nature and volume of raw materials used in its products, which is summarized in so-called materials data sheets and made available throughout the supply chain. In the automotive industry, a detailed list of the raw materials used is part of the customer-specific requirements that manufacturers demand of their suppliers. meets these requirements in full.
Using & reusing
is committed, both at the divisional level and through on-site initiatives, to recycling materials wherever possible. Two examples:
In the eXchange program, used car parts are industrially recycled. Refurbished starters, alternators, and ignition distributors are, for example, used in vehicle repairs and are up to 40 percent cheaper than the equivalent new parts. Around 2.5 million parts are reused each year. Recycling saves 23,000 tons of CO2 compared with the production of new parts.
Under the "Zero to Landfill" program, the plant in Worcester, England takes back old boilers and recycles them. About one ton of plastic is recovered weekly and used, among other things, for the production of garden sheds for a local project.

302-Energy
At Bosch, electrical power and heat for machines and production equipment, the ventilation of buildings, and the operation of ovens and foundries account for most of the company’s energy consumption. makes continuous efforts to reduce its energy consumption, as this also makes a decisive contribution to reducing CO2 emissions and conserving resources. To standardize this commitment and ensure that its energy-saving activities are continuously expanded, applies an environmental management system based on 14001. In 2017, 54 production locations already had a certified energy management system in place, a share of 19 percent. Apart from this, monitors energy consumption and CO2 at all its large production and development locations. The divisions then plan detailed measures to put energy efficiency and energy saving measures into practice in their respective areas of responsibility. Moreover, in cooperation with researchers and universities, the GoGreen initiative develops energy-saving technologies in joint research projects.

302–5 Reductions in energy requirements of products and services
is committed to continuously making its own products and services more eco-friendly across divisions and business sectors. Since 2000, the company has thus taken the systematic “Design for Environment” (DfE) approach, which ensures that ecological concerns are considered throughout the product development process. From the earliest stages of development, closely monitors the potential use of hazardous substances and resource efficiency. It also carries out a life cycle assessment that examines the use of new and recycled materials, recycling capability, emissions, and energy consumption.
At each division, trained Dfcoordinators support supervisors in meeting current legal, customer, and company requirements related to eco-friendly product design. training concept with detailed documentation for seminars and self-learning modules also ensures that all associates involved in the development of a product – from purchasing and development to sales – have the right background knowledge.

305-Emissions
As part of its social responsibility, aims to promote climate protection and support the Paris climate agreement of 2015, which seeks to limit global warming to a maximum of two degrees Celsius by reducing emissions. is thus making efforts to reduce the greenhouse gases produced at the company. In 2008, it set itself the aim of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions relative to value added by 20 percent by 2020 over the 2007 reference year. Since then, the company has made major progress and thus set a more ambitious goal: by 2020, now aims to reduce its CO2 emissions by 35 percent compared with 2007.
With the aim of reducing CO2 emissions systematically, has introduced an environmental management system based in the 14001 standard at all its large production and development locations. Until now, 221 locations have received external certification, a share of 76 percent. The company has made a great deal of progress thanks to intelligent technical solutions, especially in energy efficiency. At all locations of the consolidated companies, uses a company-wide approach to energy and CO2 monitoring. In addition, is applying the 50001 environmental management system to standardize its commitment to energy efficiency. Until now, 54 locations (2017) have received external certification based on this norm. This represents a share of 19 percent. The aim is to achieve a 90 percent share of 14001 certification within the next three years. In addition to this, there are company-wide initiatives and activities that promote the aim of reducing CO2 emissions. One of them is the GoGreen initiative at Rexroth. With several measures, more than 150,000 tons of CO2 have been saved since the project was launched.
By the end of 2017, had reduced its greenhouse gas emissions relative to value-added by 32.8 percent.
In 2017, achieved an A- at the Supply Chain Climate Score. Companies scoring an A- find themselves within the 6% highest scoring companies, and within the 3% highest scoring companies in their sector. Please find further information here.
In the next step of its climate strategy, is planning to switch to an absolute CO2 target, in line with the Science-Based Targets method.

306-Effluents and waste
To further reduce its waste and conserve resources, aims to step up its recycling activities. Compared with 2015 levels, the company aims to reduce waste by six percent relative to value-added by 2018. In 2017, had already achieved a 4.1 percent reduction. To meet this goal, the company has initiated activities both at its divisions and locations that aim to reuse materials wherever possible. For instance:
• Within the framework of the eXchange program, used car parts are industrially refurbished. For instance, revamped starters, generators, or distributors are used to repair cars, and are 40 percent less expensive than new parts. Some 2.5 million components are reinstalled into vehicles each year. Compared with new products, this saves about 23,000 tons of CO2.
• With the “Zero to Landfill” program, the plant in Worcester, England, takes back old boilers and recycles them. The plant gains about a ton of plastic a week as a result of this process. Among other things, the material is used to build garden sheds for a local community project.
Water is also a central focus of sustainability initiatives. In 2015, the company aimed to reduce water use by six percent relative to value added by 2018. In 2017, it had already achieved a 10.2 percent reduction.

Please click on the topics on the top to find detailed information.
In the Principles of Social Responsibility, management and associate representatives profess to respect human rights, equal opportunities, and fair working conditions, and to uphold global standards in occupational health and safety. ensures the latter with a health and safety management system that is based on the internationally recognized 18001 standard, which has been rolled out at all locations. Around 126 locations have been certified by an independent certification organization.
The Principles of Social Responsibility are based on the core labor standards developed by the International Labor Organization (ILO). The heads of the various business divisions, regional subsidiaries, and locations are responsible for their implementation. Every associate is informed of the substance of the principles and has the possibility to report violations. The same goes for violations of the Code of Business Conduct, which builds on the Principles of Social Responsibility and includes legal provisions and internal company regulations, in particular in the area of compliance. The Code of Business Conduct is aimed at associates and business partners worldwide.
is also committed to compliance with social standards at the supplier level. Bosch’s purchasing conditions state: "The supplier commits to complying with the relevant regulations on dealing with employees, environmental protection, and safety in the workplace, and to work to limit any adverse impact from its activities on people and the environment." The basis for Bosch’s requirements for suppliers are the ILO’s labor standards, with their four basic principles: freedom of association, abolition of forced labor, elimination of child labor, and prohibiting discrimination in employment or occupation. Furthermore, has been a member of the United Nations Global Compact since 2004. In its annual progress report, the company details how these principles and measures are helping to guarantee workers' rights, both within the company and among its suppliers.
Bosch’s social activities have always been oriented toward the common good, in particular the promotion of equal opportunity through education. At nearly all locations worldwide, there are initiatives that enable associates to volunteer for social projects. To provide both targeted and long-term aid, has set up foundations in different countries. These non-profit organizations are currently implementing educational and social projects in China, Brazil, India, and the US.
supports this commitment for two reasons. First, the volunteers reflect values by working for a cohesive society, and second, they demonstrate team spirit and develop creative solutions to problems - skills that contribute directly to the company’s innovative strength. This is why supporting a local social enterprise in the implementation of a project is part of the program for up and coming executives in Germany.

403-Occupational health and safety
is committed to helping its associates stay healthy, and it has taken several measures to do this. For instance, the company has a comprehensive health management program that supports associates with preventive measures and helps them recover from periods of illness. With its "befit" program, offers health-related support that promotes the health and well-being of its associates across the company. In addition to regular check-ups, ergonomic workplace checks, childcare, sports and nutrition programs, also offers an agency service for care services, as well as seminars on stress management and mental health. The company draws on the latest scientific findings, as well as on the experience of company doctors, workplace designers, social workers, and fitness experts. Thanks to cooperation between the different specialist departments and partnerships with external actors, associates can get quick and professional support for any health-related issue.
also helps maintain the health of its associates with an occupational safety system at its production and development locations around the world. In 2007, introduced an occupational safety management system based on the global 18001 standard. The system simplifies occupational safety processes and aims to reduce the number of accidents in the workplace. It focuses on detecting potential accident and health risks for associates and introducing preventive measures at an early stage. The system has been implemented at all production and development locations, and 126 locations had received external certification by the end of 2017. This represents a share of 44 percent. Within the next three years, the aim is for over 90 percent of locations to receive 18001 certification. In addition to this, has launched the global “Safety Basics” initiative, which is based on six principles that were defined by safety experts. The aim is to help associates and their supervisors further reduce the number of accidents in day-to-day work. The six rules are now included in the occupational safety measures. At Bosch, safety has become part of management culture: it must be included in standard processes, and supervisors and associates are expected to share their knowledge with their colleagues.

404-Training and education
Demographic change and the resulting lack of specialists mean that not only has to attract up-and-coming talent, it must also take measures to build associate loyalty. Lifelong and continuous learning is the key to being an attractive employer and securing the company’s further development. In particular, the fields of digital transformation, Industry 4.0, Internet of Things (IoT) and electrification call for high-quality education and qualifications, and must see to it that its associates are at the top of their game. This is why the company takes the “Learnagility” approach, which makes it possible to build on knowledge efficiently and quickly. The approach is based on systematic skills and training management. With a broad range of traditional training sessions and webinars, web-based training, videos, and virtual classrooms, associates can keep abreast of the skills they need to carry out their tasks. The training formats focus on both specialist knowledge and soft skills. With target group-specific programs, associates receive training at least once a year and can choose from a broad range of additional courses. In 2017, 560,000 participants took part in 671,000 days of training in seminars and webinars. In addition to this, some 509,000 online learning programs were completed (WBTs, learning material).
To make associates fit for the requirements of the digital transformation, is expanding its traditional training catalog to include “Digital Learning” and the “Learnagility Toolbox”, which promote independent learning. The former includes easily accessible further training opportunities in the form of communities, videos, virtual classrooms, and e-universities. The Working Out Loud program is one example of the self-learning approach: over a period of twelve weeks, teams of five associates meet online to tackle a challenge together that they have selected themselves.

405-Diversity and Equal Opportunity
sees diversity as a decisive part of its long-term success, and embraces its associates’ different ways of thinking, experiences, and ways of life. The company strongly believes that mixed teams often come up with better results, and that an appreciation of individuality promotes a healthy work environment. This is why diversity is an integral part of corporate strategy. makes sure that all associates around the world – regardless of sex, age, or background – can contribute their individual strengths and experiences to the company’s success. To this end, has implemented a diversity management program that focuses on age, gender, internationality, and work culture.
One of the ways in which promotes mixed-age teams is with senior experts: former executives who continue to act as consultants for the company after they have retired – for instance to help build new locations or contribute to quality assurance at plants. In 2017, some 1,600 senior experts were on the roster. Inter-generational tandems and the 50plus@associate network also promote cross-generational exchanges for and its associates.
When it comes to gender equality, aims to achieve a 20 percent share of women in management positions by 2020. In 2017, the figure was 16.1 percent. What is more, the company supports women with the women@associate network. More than 3,000 female associates in 20 countries meet at a broad range of events and activities around the world to build and share knowledge. There is also a mentoring program for women.
also has associate networks that promote international cooperation: with networks such as afric@bosch, For abroad, Türkisches Forum Bosch, and Chinese@bosch, the company pools cultural expertise and passes it on as needed. Many of these networks were founded and further developed by associates.
With regard to work culture, also gives associates around the world the possibility to strike a balance between their individual career plans, lifestyles, and personal goals. With more than 100 flexible work-time models, among them part-time work, mobile work models, and job sharing, the company promotes a family-friendly work culture. In 2013, introduced a work-life balance standard for its locations around the world: among other things, the company embraced the idea that management can be a part-time job. What is more, also supports its associates in challenging phases of life, for instance when they are caring for relatives or sick children. In addition, recognizes family leave in the same way as a foreign assignment: as a career building block.

The interactive graphics enable the comparison of environmental, social, and financial data of the Group over several years as well as the presentation of specific key figures by region and country. In the Group financial figures, the former joint ventures Hausgeräte and Automotive Steering were consolidated on a pro rata basis between 2007 and 2012. Following that, they were consolidated at equity until 2014 (only their pro rata after-tax result was included). In 2015, they were fully consolidated. All the other figures do not include companies in which holds a stake of 50 percent or less. As a result of the full consolidation that came into effect in 2015, many of Bosch’s environmental figures have changed considerably.

2017 in review
“Connectivity can play a major role in protecting the environment. The smarter the city, the more sustainable it is.”
Dr. Volkmar Denner
Sustainable cities: one challenge, two perspectives
Dr. Volkmar Denner, chairman of the board of management of GmbH, and the climate researcher Professor Ottmar Edenhofer discuss urban transformation.
5 approaches to transforming cities
By 2050, around two-thirds of the world population will live in cities. Traffic is expected to triple in urban centers, which already account for 75 percent of global energy consumption. Air quality will thus remain a central issue, especially in global megacities such as London, New York, and Beijing. Social inequality and unequal access to education will also pose major challenges. How can we respond to these challenges? How can cities be made more sustainable? And how can quality of life be improved in urban environments? These are the questions that is addressing across business sectors and divisions, with the aim of rethinking the city.
New forms of mobility
The traffic of tomorrow will be emission-free, flexible, and resource-saving. Here, we describe five new approaches to sustainable transportation.
New forms of social interaction
The cities of the future should offer their populations quality of life. In Curitiba, Brazil, supports young talent from disadvantaged neighborhoods.
Reducing energy consumption and promoting the use of renewable sources: How Microgrids establish a smarter power supply in cities.
Smartphones rather than screwdrivers: How a software solution has revolutionized work at OSRAM
For manufacturing companies, energy efficiency is required to conserve resources and reduce emissions. shows how it’s done in five steps.
Promoting sustainable cities
In 2017, addressed urban development and the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11. The company was active in several areas, including mobility, building technology, and production.

Honoring innovation
Modernizing mining
In Brazil, the mining industry is an important economic sector. However, safety in the extraction of minerals can still be improved. In 2017, the new Integrated Solutions Brazil subsidiary tackled this challenge and developed an Iosolution. Connected Mine connects objects, devices, services, and machines with an address. Moreover, the intelligent production network runs automatically, increases energy efficiency, and reduces both operating costs and emissions. With the new solution’s startstop feature alone, estimates that 44 metric tons of CO₂ can be saved per vehicle each year.
Celebrating diversity
In 2007, was one of first companies to sign the Charta der Vielfalt (Diversity Charter). The German initiative aims to create a work environment at companies and institutions that is free of prejudice. Regardless of gender, nationality, or age, all associates should be treated with the same level of respect. In the past decade, diversity has become an integral part of everyday life at Bosch.
Providing access to clean water
The location in Nashik, India, had a dam built within just twelve weeks to improve local agricultural conditions. The Lakshmanpada project was successfully completed at the end of May, ahead of the monsoon season. The dam can store around 400 million liters of water, and thus provide clean drinking water to some 200 households from five villages. In addition to this, more than half of local farmers can now plant a second cereal crop each year. And thanks to the rise in groundwater levels, eight drinking water wells and four hand pumps now have a stable water supply.
Promoting talent in technical fields
For the tenth year in a row, the Group in Austria has presented the “Invented for life” prize. In the fall of each year, students in their final year of study at the polytechnic are invited to submit their thesis projects in a range of categories. An expert jury of associates then evaluates the submissions. The winners selected are awarded a six-month internship at a location in Austria – the perfect start to their careers.
Discovering science
In cooperation with GmbH, for the past ten years Stiftung has been offering tenth-grade girls from the Stuttgart area an opportunity to discover the fascinating worlds of science and technology. With the Girls’ Campus, the girls attend weekend seminars that provide practical insights into the mobility of the future. The program also includes presentations, guided tours, and presentation training.
Giving young people prospects for the future
With the Southern Europe Training Initiative, began offering apprenticeships to young people from Italy, Portugal, and Spain in 2014. The aim is to contribute to fighting youth unemployment in these countries. Over the past four years, has created a total of 175 extra apprenticeships and spent 14 million euros on the program. In 2017, 72 young people started apprenticeships: 25 are now learning in their home countries, and the remaining 47 have come to Germany. Thanks to language lessons that last several months and continuous support at their locations, these young women and men are gradually integrating into their places of work and German society. Around 85 percent of the apprentices successfully complete the program.
Honoring innovation
Each year, innovative projects aimed at improving occupational safety and energy efficiency are initiated at locations around the world. To raise awareness about these new approaches across the company, in 2017 began honoring the best ideas with the Award. The winners included projects from Brazil, China, and Germany. “Energy Management 4.0” makes energy consumption transparent. Among other things, the “Cold Degreasing” project has reduced energy consumption with a newly developed detergent that is effective at low temperatures. In turn, the “GoGreen” initiative takes a comprehensive approach to saving energy. The locations also demonstrated creativity with regard to safety: with the “Building a safe plant” project, executives and associates showed their commitment to occupational safety. With “System for Safety”, they have improved workplace safety with a continuous improvement process. And with “Virtual Reality Safety Training @ CC”, associates receive training in a digital working world.

WithdrawalVision and targets
products spark people’s enthusiasm, improve their quality of life, and contribute to conserving natural resources.
Definition of sustainability
We provide technological answers to ecological questions.
For the Group, sustainability means securing the company’s long-term success while at the same time helping protect the environment for current and future generations.
Against this backdrop, our “Invented for life” leitmotiv aims to make renewable sources of energy even more economical, and mobility safer, cleaner, and more efficient. More generally, it also focuses on developing products that protect the environment and conserve resources. This makes ecological concerns an engine of innovation and shapes the foundation of the Group's business success.
Our commitment to a healthy social environment is another dimension of our understanding of sustainability. Our special ownership structure reflects this: 92 percent of the share capital of is held by Stiftung, which spends dividends exclusively on charitable initiatives. At the same time, the Group's corporate structure helps ensure its financial independence and enables the company to plan for the long-term and make investments that secure its future.
In its quest to strike a balance between economic, ecological, and social concerns, focuses on four sustainability-related areas of activity: environment, products, associates, and society.
With the help of a comprehensive analysis, defines the dimensions of sustainability upon which its activities are based. It applies a management system approach that examines and assesses all sustainability-related topics. For each dimension under examination, the analysis assesses whether a global policy is in place, as well as whether there are measurable targets, suitable indicators, and topic-specific training measures. Moreover, the analysis examines the extent to which each dimension plays a role in external reporting.
The analysis is part of comprehensive assessments conducted in cooperation with the respective specialist departments. The results are then evaluated in cooperation with the sustainability office. On this basis, the sustainability council recommends potential focal points and sustainability targets, which the sustainability steering committee then approves.
The following graph shows which dimensions and its stakeholders consider relevant within the context of the defined areas of activity.
Targets
Taking our areas of activity and the related focal topics into account, has adopted five central sustainability targets.
1 Systematic CO₂ reduction
By 2020, aims to reduce relative CO₂ emissions by 35 percent over 2007 levels, and is thus contributing to systematic CO₂ reduction. By 2016, the company had already achieved a reduction of 30.6 percent.
2 Resource conservation and waste reduction
In addition, at the beginning of 2016 we established targets for waste reduction and the responsible use of water resources. By 2018, we aim to reduce the relative amount of waste and water consumption by 2 percent each year. In 2016, we reduced relative water consumption by 3.9 percent and relative waste consumption by 1.5 percent.
3 Consistent environmental and social audits
By 2020, we aim to conduct 1,000 environmental and occupational safety audits of our suppliers around the world. Until now (as of 2016), we have audited 614 suppliers. In so doing, has been able to establish sustainability standards throughout the value-added chain.
4 More women in management positions
sees diversity as an asset. This is why we put every effort into attracting women to the company. Among other things, we have committed to increasing the share of women in management positions at to 20 percent by 2020. At present, 15.4 percent of executives are women.
5 Fewer accidents in the workplace
We are continuously working to improve occupational safety for our associates. Our aim is to reduce accidents in the workplace at to 1.7 accidents per million hours worked by 2020. In 2016, the figure was 2.7.
In addition to these five central topics, pursues a number of qualitative sustainability targets.
