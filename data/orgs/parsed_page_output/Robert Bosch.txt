 We take responsibility 
For us, sustainability means securing the company’s long-term success while at the same time protecting the natural resources on which present and future generations depend. Ecology is thus a driver of innovation. At the same time, we demonstrate a particularly high level of corporate social responsibility — both within the company and beyond.

Our business sectors
Mobility Solutions
Mobility Solutions
Its main areas of activity are injection technology and powertrain peripherals for internal-combustion engines, diverse solutions for powertrain electrification, steering systems, safety and driver-assistance systems, technology for user-friendly infotainment as well as vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, repair-shop concepts, and technology and services for the automotive aftermarket. The sector combines the group’s expertise in three mobility domains — automation, electrification, and connectivity — and offers its customers integrated mobility solutions that allow cars to interact with other means of transportation such as bicycles, trains, and buses. At the beginning of 2018, the sector restructured itself by bringing its Gasoline Systems and Diesel Systems divisions, as well as the electromobility unit, together under one roof in a new Powertrain Solutions division. This will allow it to serve its customers with the optimum combination of technologies, since even with electrification increasing, efficient gasoline and diesel engines will continue to play a significant role for a long time to come. In addition, the newly-formed Connected Mobility Solutions division brings together the connected mobility solutions and services that had previously been spread across various units within the Mobility Solutions business sector.
Industrial Technology
Industrial Technology
The sector includes the Drive and Control Technology division, whose portfolio includes customized drive, control, and linear motion solutions for factory automation, plant construction and engineering, and mobile machinery. It also offers a comprehensive range of services, carries out large-scale international projects, and is a leading user and provider of connected manufacturing solutions. The Packaging Technology division provides process and packaging solutions for the pharmaceuticals and foodstuffs industries. Its range includes stand-alone machines, systems solutions, and an extensive service portfolio. In addition, the new Connected Industry business unit has been part of the Industrial Technology business sector since the start of 2018. It combines the software development and projects relating to Industry 4.0 that had previously been spread across different units.
Consumer Goods
Consumer Goods
Its Power Tools division is a supplier of power tools, power-tool accessories, and measuring technology. In addition to power tools such as hammer drills, cordless screwdrivers, and jigsaws, its comprehensive product portfolio also includes gardening equipment such as lawnmowers, hedge trimmers, and high-pressure cleaners. One of the division’s focal points is convenient, high-performance cordless tools, and increasingly also web-enabled tools and services. The Consumer Goods business sector also includes Hausgeräte GmbH, which offers a broad range of modern, energy-efficient, and increasingly connected household appliances. Its product portfolio ranges from washing machines and tumble dryers through refrigerators and freezers, stoves and ovens, and dishwashers, to small appliances such as vacuum cleaners, coffee makers, and food processors.
Energy and Building Technology
Energy and Building Technology
Its Building Technologies division (formerly Security Systems) has two areas of business: the global product business for innovative security and communications solutions, and the regional integrator business. The latter offers solutions and services for building security, energy efficiency, and building automation in selected countries. Both units focus on commercial applications. The product portfolio encompasses video-surveillance, intrusion-detection, and voice-alarm systems, access-control and software management systems, as well as professional audio, conference, and fire-detection systems. The Thermotechnology division supplies energyefficient heating products and hot-water solutions, primarily in Europe. With a view to functions such as remote diagnosis, webenabled devices are becoming increasingly important. The Global Service Solutions division offers outsourcing for business processes and services. Within Bosch, it also provides shared-service functions. Smart Home brings Bosch’s smart-home products and services together under one roof, including the associated systems and software expertise.
 Ownership structure and organization 
 Since 1964, Bosch’s majority shareholder has been Stiftung GmbH, a charitable foundation. The Stiftung carries on the charitable and social endeavors of the company founder in contemporary form. It sees itself as a foundation that pursues its objectives both with programs and institutions of its own, and by supporting suitable projects and initiatives proposed by others for tackling the tasks faced by society.

Notable research
At Bosch, research forms the basis of our products and services. That means it plays a key role in the success of the brand.
Check out some of the milestones in the history of Research
Research has a long tradition at Bosch. The first patent filed under the name of was issued in 1897 for an oscillating sleeve for the company’s magneto ignition device. Early on, and his colleagues made a commitment to deliver outstanding levels of quality. They made their mark by identifying the latest trends and manufacturing new products from core technologies.
Ever since our company was founded, we have sought to play our part in making the world a better place, one small step at a time. Our conduct and business activities are guided by a brand promise: even before we create a product, we will always put an emphasis on quality in our research and in the results of that research. We understand that conducting research involves a responsibility to both our partners and the wider world, and we endeavor to fulfil that responsibility at all times. That’s how we create inspiring products. And that’s how we create technology “Invented for life”.
We conduct research in an international network
Our goal is to forge alliances with the best research institutes around the world. In addition, every location is expected to act as a kind of radar for Research by scanning its respective region to detect megatrends.
Our worldwide research and advance engineering locations
Currently, 12 locations actively contribute to Corporate Research. Each location fulfils a specific role.
Boston
Boston
The Research Center in Cambridge, MA, is where our engineers develop cutting-edge methods for modern and future technology.

Spotting trends, improving existing products, and coming up with new ideas – this seems the best way to sum up the successful strategy that is the common thread running through the history of research and development at Bosch. It applies to the company’s very first product, the magneto ignition device, which would never have been successfully installed in a motor vehicle without the ingenuity of the people working in the new company. The specialists working for Bosch’s chief engineer Gottlob Honold came up with many technological highlights that paved the way for the company’s success.
Research and development provide the technical basis for overcoming the major challenges of the future.
Volkmar Denner
1886 - 1900
Courtyard trials – Early days in the workshop
Everybody starts out small. Things were no different for in November 1886. With just one master craftsman and an errand boy, the “Workshop for Precision Mechanics and Electrical Engineering” was a modest little affair in a courtyard-entrance building in Stuttgart. What we now envisage as research and development was practically unimaginable back then. At that time, did not have its own product portfolio, so there was not even a starting point for research and development activities. As far as business was concerned, would later describe this period as “a shambles”. Individual orders kept his head above water. In 1897 however, the company had already applied for its first patent – an oscillating sleeve for magneto ignition devices.
1901 – 1925
Honold’s spark of genius – First steps
After a series of ups and downs, the small company run by gradually expanded its workforce to 37 by 1900. built his first factory the following year, creating space for 200 associates in a modern reinforced concrete building complete with ventilation systems and large windows. However, the new factory did not yet include a research and development department. had 200 associates by 1904 and as many as 1,000 by 1908. This rapid growth was all thanks to the high-voltage magneto ignition system for motor vehicles, developed by Gottlob Honold, his first chief engineer. It was Honold as well who drew the logo still used today, the double-armature, in 1918. In addition to absolute thoroughness and an early promise of uncompromising quality, and his associates distinguished themselves above all by recognizing trends and creating new products from basic technologies.
1926 - 1932
More irons in the fire – New businesses
When Walter Dorn began work in the physics department of the senior laboratory team in 1924, he wondered “why wanted me at all. In my naivety, thought physicists were there to invent things. But everything was making had already been invented. So why did they need another physicist?” But they did in fact need physicists, because was then facing a period of profound upheaval. The sales crisis in the automotive market in 1925-1926 led to diversify its products. In this context, a department was established in 1930 to clarify “through preliminary investigations” which new products were suitable for inclusion in the company’s production program.
1933 - 1945
Troubled times
At first, research and development activities barely changed at all under the Nazi dictatorship. was able to continue its development projects in its established lines of business. But it was not long before the Nazi regime’s military plans began to have an impact on a number of research and development activities at Bosch, including gasoline injection for aircraft engines and television technology.
1946 - 1964
Venturing into the unknown – From stop-gap products to electronics
The Allied victory in the spring of 1945 ended the reign of terror imposed by the Nazi regime in Germany. Every helping hand available was needed and at first, the primary goal was to simply produce very simple products. It was essentially the development of individual semiconductor elements as the first electronic components for the automotive sector at the end of the 1950s that paved the way for a promising new area of business.
1965 - 1982
On solid ground – Reorganization
The 1960s brought fundamental changes for Bosch. With the company growing rapidly, the old centralized structure was replaced by the division-based organization still in place today. These far-reaching changes were also evident in more concrete terms. By 1964, the site in Stuttgart had become far too small and decided to relocate corporate headquarters and corporate research activities to a building complex on the “Schillerhöhe”, a wooded ridge around ten kilometers from the city center. This complex was completed in 1969. The innovations of the 1960s and 1970s, such as Jetronic and the anti-lock braking system, fitted in very well with a leitmotif for the development work that issued under the pressure of the first global oil crisis in 1973, namely to make driving safe, clean, and economical.
1983 - 2005
Developed for every market – Groundbreaking innovations and globalization
During the last two decades of the millennium, researchers and developers were confronted with an increasingly rapid pace of development across the globe. responded to the challenges this posed with technologies to meet new customer needs, a global R&organization, new focal areas such as micromechanics, and new future-proof approaches in established areas, such as common-rail diesel injection. In 1983, for example, the system, short for “Electronic Traffic Pilot for Motorists”, which laid the foundations for today’s vehicle navigation, was presented to the public. In autumn 1993, the Central Research and Advance Engineering Division, now known as Corporate Research, was established. There, research was to begin as usual with brainstorming and, if possible, end with prototype production before it was transferred to the respective division to start volume production.
2006 - 2015
Into the connected world – Energy efficiency and connectivity
When it comes to demonstrating the importance research and development has assumed at over the last four decades, the statistics speak for themselves. Between 1970 and 2000, the R&budget increased roughly 15-fold, and its share of sales rose from 5.4 to roughly 8 percent. And since 1970, the total number of associates across all areas of research and development has increased from 5,500 to 59,000. Today, it is more and more a matter of presenting the right ideas and products derived from correctly identified megatrends and not developing them without social or technological prospects for the future. The Research and Advance Engineering Center in Renningen near Stuttgart, which opened in 2015, also illustrates the innovative orientation of the company and provides creativity with room to grow, along with guidelines for the development of market-oriented products – so that an idea can really be developed into a success story! With the founding of the Center for Artificial Intelligence in 2017, was again preparing to meet the new challenges of the future.
