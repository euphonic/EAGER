MBC2 was launched on 12th January 2003, however, back then it was not purely a movie channel. It’s programming included: Local News in English, American Drama Series, Oprah and a music show presented by Razan Al-Mougrabi called Tops and Pops. But it was movies, which touched a nerve with our viewers, and hit rating highs, at a level that nobody could have predicted. So it was in 2005 MBC2 transformed into the world’s first 24-hour free-to-air movie channel and shouted this message loudly from the rooftops with campaign messages such as non-stop movies, non-stop emotions, and the long running strap-line “Feel it”. Long Term movie deals with all the major Hollywood studios followed and Global hits such as Titanic and Gladiator proved equally successful with audiences across the Middle East and North Africa.

MBC2 was launched on 12th January 2003, however, back then it was not purely a movie channel. It’s programming included: Local News in English, American Drama Series, Oprah and a music show presented by Razan Al-Mougrabi called Tops and Pops. But it was movies, which touched a nerve with our viewers, and hit rating highs, at a level that nobody could have predicted. So it was in 2005 MBC2 transformed into the world’s first 24-hour free-to-air movie channel and shouted this message loudly from the rooftops with campaign messages such as non-stop movies, non-stop emotions, and the long running strap-line “Feel it”. Long Term movie deals with all the major Hollywood studios followed and Global hits such as Titanic and Gladiator proved equally successful with audiences across the Middle East and North Africa. Proof that no content crosses borders better than movies was underlined when MBC2 became the most viewed Pan Arab channel. The Channel offers Themed night on a daily base. Such as: The Early Movie — Airing every day; Monday Night Premieres; Comedy Night —Every Saturday; In addition to Horror themed nights, and a daily Entertainment show. 2 is, also airing a new type of filler called “Me and the Cinema”. The segment showcase award-winning Arab Actors and Directors talking about Hollywood’s influence on them.
In 2011 MBC2 brought local production back to the channel by commissioning Scoop with Raya in which our globe-trotting presenter meets the stars. On April 1st, 2012 - MBC2 launched an all-new and extended version of “Scoop with Raya”, presented by Raya Abirached.
Raya enabled our viewers with access to all the top movie stars and kept them up-to-date with all the latest Hollywood news and gossip. Aligned with MBC2 positioning as the “#1 FREE-TO-NON-& AFRICA”, this show extends Hollywood news from a truly Arabic perspective. The show becomes Hollywood’s preferred platform for delivering movie news to audiences around the Arab world. Raya, needless to mention, raises the bar with her own brand of glamour.

The region's first free-to-air private satellite channel, has remained the region's undisputed leader and broadcasting industry pioneer for nearly two decades, the group has evolved to become a global multimedia powerhouse that continues its trailblazing path throughout the Arab world and beyond.
The pillars of MBC’s success – the foundations upon which our past, present and future are built – focus on our viewers, advertising partners and, naturally, our people. Without the support, dedication and loyalty of our viewers, our advertisers and our expert staff, our vision could not have become a reality. It is upon these same pillars that Group continues to grow, by pushing the boundaries and leading the way, exploring new formats, new platforms and new materials. Working beyond our screens to enable our viewers to access MBC’s premium quality content out of the home – on mobiles, online, and on demand – we are harnessing the latest in technology and convergence across all platforms.
It is a privilege for me to lead this innovative organization, and reiterate MBC’s commitment to providing the absolute best in quality: from the caliber of our audiences on which advertisers have come to rely, to the best in information, entertainment and interaction that our viewers have come to expect.
