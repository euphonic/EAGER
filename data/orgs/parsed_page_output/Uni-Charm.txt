Copyright© Unicharm CorporationAbout the Fire at Neemrana Factory in India
For Unicharm Corporation's (Headquarters: Mita, Tokyo, CEO: Takahisa Takahara) subsidiary Unicharm India Private Ltd.'s Neemrana Factory (Inside the Neemrana Industrial Area of Rajasthan State which is in the northern part of India), on October 25, 2017, at 00:30 am (Local time Oct 24th, 21:30 pm) a fire broke out in the product warehouse. During the time of the fire, about 300 employees were at the site, however, no injuries have occurred.
We deeply apologize for the tremendous trouble and inconvenience we have caused to people in the area, customers, clients, and partners. For the reason for the fire, it is currently under investigation.
For our future response, first of all, we will make every effort by the entire power of the Unicharm Group to ensure that we do not hinder the product supply with the highest priority.
Furthermore, we have taken this factory fire very seriously and will determine the cause of it and strive to prevent recurrence.
