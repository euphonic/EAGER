About Surgical, Inc. 

Surgical, Inc. (Nasdaq:ISRG), headquartered in Sunnyvale, Calif., is the pioneer and a global leader in robotic-assisted, minimally invasive surgery. develops, manufactures and markets the da Vinci
®
 system.   
About the da Vinci System

There are several models of the da Vinci system. The da Vinci systems are designed to help surgeons perform minimally invasive surgery. Da Vinci systems are not programmed to perform surgery on their own. Instead, the procedure is performed entirely by a surgeon who controls the system. Da Vinci systems offer surgeons high-definition 3vision, a magnified view, and robotic and computer assistance. They use specialized instrumentation, including a miniaturized camera and wristed instruments (i.e., scissors, scalpels and forceps) that are designed to help with precise dissection and reconstruction deep inside the body
                    
Frequently asked questions 

                                Made by in Sunnyvale, California, da Vinci Systems are advanced robotic-assisted platforms designed to expand a surgeon’s operating capabilities and offer a minimally invasive option for patients. By providing surgeons with superior visualization, enhanced dexterity, greater precision and ergonomic comfort, da Vinci systems make it possible for skilled surgeons to perform minimally invasive procedures involving complex dissection or reconstruction.
                            
The name “da Vinci” pays homage to Leonardo da Vinci, the 15th century inventor, painter, philosopher and Renaissance man. Leonardo da Vinci is widely known for advancing the study of human anatomy. He was also intrigued by mechanics and automation, which eventually led to the design of the first known robot, “Leonardo’s Robot,” which was likely made around the year 1495. 
Is the operating surgeon in the room?

                                The surgeon performing the procedure is located at a console in the operating room in close proximity to the patient and support staff. Remote surgery, or telesurgery is not a focus of Intuitive’s product design.

                                Intuitive, the United States Food and Drug Administration, hospitals, and professional medical societies all have a role in surgeon training. While has developed a world-class program that supports surgeons in developing the knowledge and skills needed to use da Vinci technology safely and efficiently, individual hospitals are responsible for directing the training requirements and credentialing of the robotic-assisted surgeons who receive privileges at their facilities.

Cookie Policyrisks: Patient facing
Serious complications may occur with any surgery, including da Vinci® surgery, up to and including death. In addition, there are risks that are specific to certain procedures. Also, some medical conditions can increase the risks of any surgery. Patients should discuss pertinent risks with their doctors.
This document provides a summary of the risks associated with surgery and includes four different sections. 
Section includes the negative outcomes, risks and complications of any type of surgery.  
Section includes the negative outcomes, risks and complications of minimally invasive techniques.  
Section includes the negative outcomes, risks and complications of da Vinci surgery. 
Section includes the negative outcomes, risks and complications of representative, specific procedures.  
 Negative Outcomes, Risks, and Complications of Any Type
This section covers negative outcomes, risks and complications associated with any type of surgery. Common approaches/methods of surgery include: open surgery (through a large incision), thoracotomy incision (through a large chest incision), transoral surgery (through the mouth), thoracoscopic or laparoscopic surgery (through a few small incisions or the belly button) with traditional laparoscopy or da Vinci robotic-assisted laparoscopy.
1. During Surgery
Loss of a large amount of blood (blood transfusion needed)
Any inadvertent cut, tear, puncture, burn or injury to organ, structure, or tissue, including, but not limited to:
- Major blood vessel
- Hollow organ, such as the bowel or bladder
- Solid organ, such as the spleen, kidney, heart , lungs or liver
- Ureter (tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder)
- Nerves
Loss of a needle, piece of an instrument, particulate or any other object used during surgery in patient’s body
Anesthesia risks (anesthesia is medicine that allows patients to sleep deeply and not feel pain during surgery): heart attack, stroke, blood clotting deep in the body, blocked lung artery, pneumonia (serious lung infection), dental injury, injury to the vocal cord and death
Patient positioning injury: hemodynamic, intraocular pressure, neurologic, soft tissue injuries
2. After Surgery
The complications listed below may go away on their own, with standard treatment from a doctor, or may require: medicine, radiological intervention (allows doctors to see inside your body with imaging such as X-rays, or scans or ultrasound), admission back into the hospital, extended hospital stay, and/or another operation.
Bleeding
Urinary tract infection and/or urine will not empty completely from the bladder
Blocked intestine or small bowel, nausea/vomiting
Heart attack or irregular heartbeat, inflammation of the sac covering the heart
Blood clot in a vessel that breaks away and travels to another blood vessel (often in the brain, tract, kidneys or leg), blood clotting deep inside the body, or blocked lung artery (usually blocked by a blood clot)
Collapsed lung, pneumonia (serious lung infection), build-up of fluid between the layers of tissue lining the lungs and chest cavity, abnormal build-up of fluid in the air sacs of the lungs which leads to shortness of breath, need for re-intubation (tube inserted in the mouth to help support breathing), or prolonged intubation
Infection, blood build-up outside of vessels, fluid build-up, pus build-up in the abdomen, pelvis or chest
Infection of the cavity where organs like the stomach and colon lie
Breakdown and release of muscle fiber into the blood stream which can cause kidney damage
Injury to adjacent organs
Large amount of drainage from wound, or drainage which lasts a long period of time
Infection at the incision site
Bursting of the wound at the incision site
Hernia (bulging of organ or fatty tissue) at the incision site
Sudden kidney failure
Nerve disorder that causes weakness, numbness, tingling or pain (neuropathy)
Loss of vision that lasts for a short period of time or does not go away
Spread of cancer cells
Inability to work
Death
Negative Outcomes, Risks and Complications of Minimally Invasive Surgery
This section covers negative outcomes, risks and complications of minimally invasive surgery (through one or a few small incisions), in addition to the risks above. Examples include traditional laparoscopy, thoracoscopy, transoral endoscopy and da Vinci robotic-assisted laparoscopy.
1. During Surgery
Surgeon must switch from minimally invasive surgery to open surgery (through a large incision) or hand-assisted surgery. This is usually due to: patient anatomy/frame, severe scarring or swelling of tissues, injury during surgery, technical challenges, cancer or disease that can be seen in more places than first thought, or the patient cannot tolerate gas/air in abdomen (used to inflate the abdomen during minimally invasive surgery)
Longer operating and anesthesia time
instrument or equipment injures hollow or solid organ(s) or blood vessel(s)
Short-term nerve damage caused by how the patient was positioned on the operating table
Complications or injury to the eyes/vision, face or larynx (voice box) caused when the patient’s head is placed lower than his/her feet on the operating table
Temporary swelling of tissue due to gas in the tissue
Changes in heart rate, blood pressure or blood values due to absorption of the gas used during minimally invasive surgery
2. After Surgery
Pain from the gas used during the surgery
Negative Outcomes, Risks, and Complications of da Vinci Robotic–Assisted Surgery
In addition to the risks in and above, which are not unique to da Vinci, this section covers negative outcomes, risks and complications of da Vinci robotic-assisted surgery. Surgery using the da Vinci robotic system may be associated with longer operative and anesthesia times. As with any device, there is also the risk that the da Vinci robotic system could malfunction or fail leading to serious injury or the need to switch to another type of approach. Switching to another approach could also result in a longer procedure time, a longer time under anesthesia and increased complications.
Negative Outcomes, Risks, and Complications of Representative, Specific Procedures
This section covers negative outcomes, risks, and complications of representative, specific procedures in addition to the risks listed in sections I, and It is not based on whether the surgeon operates using open surgery, a large chest incision, traditional laparoscopy or da Vinci robotic-assisted laparoscopy.
Note: Not all procedures listed below are available for all da Vinci systems, instruments and accessories

risks: Surgeon facing
Serious complications may occur with any surgery, including da Vinci® surgery, up to and including death. In addition, there are risks that are specific to certain procedures. Certain pre-existing medical conditions can also increase the risks of any surgery. Surgeons should discuss pertinent risks with their patients.
This document provides a summary of the risks associated with surgery and includes four different sections. 
Section includes the negative outcomes, risks and complications of any type of surgery.
Section includes the negative outcomes, risks and complications of minimally invasive techniques.
Section includes the negative outcomes, risks and complications of da Vinci Surgery.
Section includes the  negative outcomes, risks and complications of representative, specific procedures.
Adverse Events, Risks, and Complications of Any Type 
This section covers adverse events, risks, and complications associated with all operative procedures in general and are specific to the method or approach used (for example, abdominal/laparotomy incision (“open surgery”), thoracotomy incision, thoracoscopy, da Vinci System robotic-assisted laparoscopy, and conventional laparoscopy).
1. Intraoperative 
Injury (inadvertently caused by laceration, tear, perforation, puncture, electrocautery) to organ , structure,  or tissue , including , but not limited to: major blood vessel, hollow viscous organs (bowel, bladder), solid organs (spleen, kidney, liver, heart, lung), ureter, nerve 
Loss of needle, instrument fragment or any foreign body during surgery in patient’s body 
Anesthesia risks (including heart attack, stroke, deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, dental injury, vocal cord injury and death)
Patient positioning injury: hemodynamic, intraocular pressure, neurologic, soft tissue injuries 
2. Postoperative 
These complications may resolve on their own with non-operative therapy, may require medical/pharmaceutical treatment such as antibiotics, may require radiological intervention such as drain placement or embolization, may require prolonged hospitalization, may require re-admission to the hospital, or may require intervention such as re-operation.
Bleeding
Cardiac: myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, pericarditis 
Thromboembolic: deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolus 
Pulmonary: atelectasis, pneumonia, pleural effusion, pulmonary edema, need for re-intubation or prolonged intubation

Adverse Events, Risks and Complications of da Vinci Robotic–assisted Surgery 
In addition to the risks in and above, which are not unique to da Vinci, this section covers negative outcomes, risks and complications of da Vinci robotic-assisted surgery. Surgery facilitated by the da Vinci System may be associated with longer operative and anesthesia times than surgery with other approaches. As with any device, there is also the risk that the da Vinci robotic system could malfunction or fail leading to serious injury or the need to switch to another type of approach. Switching to another approach could also result in a longer procedure time, a longer time under anesthesia and increased complications. 
Adverse Events, Risks and Complications of Representative Specific Procedures
