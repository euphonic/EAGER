FOOTAGE
Background
The St. Peters Plant was built in 1959 by GlobalWafers (formerly, Monsanto Electronic Materials Company). This facility was the first merchant manufacturer of silicon wafers in the world - the first wafer produced was 19mm in diameter! Originally just a few acres in size, the facility now occupies 185 acres. The St. Peters Plant won the coveted "Missouri Quality Award" in 1994. This award is based on the same criteria as the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, but at a state level. In 1995, the St. Peters Plant was recognized as one of the "Top Ten" manufacturing facilities in the by Industry Week Magazine.
