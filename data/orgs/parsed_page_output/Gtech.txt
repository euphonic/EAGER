About Us
Armed with a passion for design and a few savings to last him 18 months, Nick Grey resigned from his position as Head of Product Development at a vacuum manufacturer.
In 2001, he founded (Grey Technology), with a clear vision:
“Our mission is to provide the best loved floor-care and garden products in the world.”
Working initially from his Worcestershire home, he developed the world’s first cordless power sweeper.
Since then, have gone from strength to strength. Today, we’ve sold over 22 million products in 13 countries and have employees in the United Kingdom, United States of America and the People’s Republic of China, making us experts in the field of cordless innovation. 
From our British headquarters, our creative team of Designers, Engineers and Model Makers are focused on creating uncomplicated, easy to use products, which will make your life easier.
