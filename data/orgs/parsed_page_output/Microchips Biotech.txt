Biotech, Inc. is dedicated to improving the lives of patients by revolutionizing drug delivery. Our proprietary microchip-based implant can store and release precise doses of drugs over months and years. The implant, which is placed under the skin by a trained physician during a simple office procedure using local anesthesia, can be wirelessly activated or deactivated by a physician or patient, without requiring removal. In addition, physicians can wirelessly modify the frequency or dose of the drug to meet the individual needs of each patient.
