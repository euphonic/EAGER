Steps to Obtaining a License

Determine feasibility of proposed company by completing a Feasibility Checklist ; and
Identify founding members that will actively participate in the new startup.
Contact a staff member to:
Request a standstill period, if desired;
By entering into a Standstill Agreement with WiSys, your company will gain additional time to evaluate the commercial potential of the as well as develop a full business plan. During this time (generally 6 months), agrees not to license the in question to another party.
Complete and submit full business plan and startup application; and
Engage in discussion and negotiation.
will work with you on follow-up actions:
Approve and execute final agreements; and
Monitor agreements with your company on an ongoing basis to provide additional support and ensure obligations and milestones are met.
Start-Up Obligations
After you have licensed the technology, as with any startup, your company must meet certain milestones and obligations.
Financial obligations may include an upfront fee, patent reimbursement, milestone fees, ongoing royalties or grant of equity. Review our standard licensing terms here .
also requires the company to submit royalty reports on a quarterly basis once product sales begin. The royalty rate normally is calculated as a percentage of the selling price of product.
Startups
currently has ten startup companies in its portfolio operating in markets ranging from sustainable technology, biotech and medtech, software development as well as materials science.
Today, our companies are producing non-invasive devices for cancer detection and accessible rehabilitation, next generation materials for the automotive, solar and electronic industries as well as microbial systems for production of specialty chemicals and biofuels.
