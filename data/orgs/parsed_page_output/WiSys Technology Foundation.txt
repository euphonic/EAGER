POLICYInterested in a Startup?
As part of its ongoing mission to move inventions created by System researchers to the marketplace, offers assistance to faculty, staff and students who wish to start companies with licensed from WiSys. We are eager to help startup companies succeed and advance System technologies from the lab to marketplace for public use and benefit.
If you are interested in forming a startup company, may be able to provide resources or introductions to groups around Wisconsin that can help move your venture forward. You will likely need technical expertise, legal resources, investment, marketing and market research in the very early stages of your formation and can help.
Below, entrepreneurs can find steps that may be helpful in understanding the overall process of licensing a from into a new startup company.
Steps to Obtaining a License
Preferably before meeting with WiSys:
Determine feasibility of proposed company by completing a Feasibility Checklist ; and
Identify founding members that will actively participate in the new startup.
Contact a staff member to:
Request a standstill period, if desired;
By entering into a Standstill Agreement with WiSys, your company will gain additional time to evaluate the commercial potential of the as well as develop a full business plan. During this time (generally 6 months), agrees not to license the in question to another party.
Complete and submit full business plan and startup application; and
Engage in discussion and negotiation.
will work with you on follow-up actions:
Approve and execute final agreements; and
Monitor agreements with your company on an ongoing basis to provide additional support and ensure obligations and milestones are met.
Start-Up Obligations
After you have licensed the technology, as with any startup, your company must meet certain milestones and obligations.
Financial obligations may include an upfront fee, patent reimbursement, milestone fees, ongoing royalties or grant of equity. Review our standard licensing terms here .
also requires the company to submit royalty reports on a quarterly basis once product sales begin. The royalty rate normally is calculated as a percentage of the selling price of product.
Startups
currently has ten startup companies in its portfolio operating in markets ranging from sustainable technology, biotech and medtech, software development as well as materials science.
Today, our companies are producing non-invasive devices for cancer detection and accessible rehabilitation, next generation materials for the automotive, solar and electronic industries as well as microbial systems for production of specialty chemicals and biofuels.
For more information on startups, contact Jennifer Cook or visit the link below.
Find FormsMicroionic Systems . Annamalai Karthikeyan, founded Microionic Systems to develop and commercialize the fast, economical synthesis of high quality activated carbon from recycled raw materials. This could have applications in mercury removal, catalysis, medical purification and electrochemical cells. Thanks to its cost-effective approach in a growing market, Microionic Systems is poised for success.
NovaScan is pioneering the use of the Cole relaxation frequency (the speed at which cells release a charge) as a method of cancer detection. In clinical trials involving more than 350 patients, NovaScan’s founders discovered that this frequency is several orders of magnitude larger for cancerous than non-cancerous cells, translating to nearly perfect sensitivity and specificity. NovaScan’s is not size constrained, nor is it expensive, and provides instantaneous results. The company’s first product is directed towards making Mohs surgery dramatically faster and more efficient.

Vibetech, Inc . Previously, there existed no comprehensive solution to the universal problem of disuse atrophy and functional decline attributable to aging, disability, illness, inactivity, injury, and surgery. Now, a Spinoff company, VibeTech, Inc., has discovered and developed a novel solution to this problem that significantly affects the health and quality of life over 18 million Americans and costs over $23 billion in direct healthcare expenses annually. VibeTech’s premier product, The ONE™, is not like anything else out there. It is the world’s first and only pressure-activated strength training and vibration therapy system. It is the most accessible and comprehensive rehabilitation product on the market for the most expensive and difficult to treat patients -- those with the greatest deficit in weight bearing physical activity. VibeTech’s new treatment modality offers a supplement to weight bearing physical activity in even the most debilitated patients, and it has no contraindications so it can be used by everyone. The Class exempt ONE™ is patented, clinically-tested, Medicare reimbursable, NIH-funded, backed by the University of Wisconsin System, supported by the Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation, and originated with funding and specifications from NASA.
