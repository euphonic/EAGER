From humble beginnings with the founding of Industries, Technology, Inc. has grown to become a world class supplier in the semiconductor industry.
It all began with a bicycle…
In 1935, Hyang-Soo Kim opened his first business on the south side of Seoul, Korea, selling imported Japanese goods, including bicycles. That business eventually grew to include the manufacturing of bicycle parts, resulting in the founding of Industries in 1945.
Seeking greater economic vitality, the Korean government looked to semiconductors as the future, so entered into semiconductor manufacturing in 1968; starting with just three wire bonders and two die bonders.
Soon after, with the help of his son, Joo-Jin (James) Kim, founder of Electronics, Inc., they began to sell ANAM’s products around the world. In the years since, Technology, Inc. has grown to become a world class supplier in the semiconductor industry, providing the highest quality packaging and test services .
Hyang-Soo’s principles were simple: work for the customer’s trust; maintain trust with quality and patience, and cut costs wherever possible. These values would help drive the growth of Amkor, the semiconductor industry and the transformation of Korea’s economy.
