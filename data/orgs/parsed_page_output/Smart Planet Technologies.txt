Engineered for environmental, economic & performance benefits
is a materials engineering and intellectual property company focused on sustainable material advancements for the paper packaging industry.
We've changed the game.
Unlike 100% plastic-coated paper cups and other paperboard barrier packaging which ends up in our landfills due to the difficulties recyclers have processing these materials through their equipment, packaging made with EarthCoatingÂ® uses 51% less plastic and may be easily pulped into recycled paper using conventional paper recycling equipment.

Did you know?
Paper cups, food trays, folding cartons, take-out boxes, ice cream containers, food wraps and lots of other plastic-coated paperboard packaging materials are sent to the landfill.
The first step to getting paper cups recycled is to make them valuable and easy for recyclers to process through conventional paper recycling equipment. 
Introducing:
EarthCoatingÂ® addresses three important pillars of sustainable packaging:
Environment
EarthCoatingÂ® is made with 51% less plastic than Polyethylene (PE) or Polylactic Acid (PLA)
EarthCoatingÂ® offers significant economic savings compared to and other bio-resin based alternatives
The graphic to the left illustrates the process of paper recycling. major part of the process includes extracting and cleaning fibers from non-paper contaminants that can found in the recycled paper stream. Unlike traditional plastic coatings, EarthCoatingÂ® is engineered for efficient processing in recycling systems. EarthCoatingÂ® is designed to fracture into small, dense particles in the pulping process, thereby avoiding the challenges found with traditional plastic coatings.
Weâ€™ve recently added additional content to our repulpability report and will continue to update our data as new information becomes available.
