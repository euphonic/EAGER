We are a business that helps humanity face its toughest challenge: how to feed a rising population, sustainably. Our world class science and innovative crop solutions transform how crops are grown to enable millions of growers to make better use of available resources. 

At the heart of our contribution is The Good Growth Plan, our six commitments to address critical challenges the world faces to achieve food security. Our business – and the world’s food security – depend on sustainable natural resources, healthy ecosystems and thriving rural communities. Which is why we cooperate with industry partners, governments and NGOs to support the achievement of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Our Corporate Governance is aligned with international standards and practice and helps us achieve not only our business objectives, but also helps create value to society that is demonstrated by our strong environmental and social performance.  
Put yourself in the shoes of a grower: it’s not always easy to make a sustainable living.

Challenges for farmers
 In this section 
 Close 
Regardless of size, the challenge for farmers is to grow healthier, more productive plants. We work with growers to get more out of their crops while keeping workers safe and farms profitable.

Farming must be financially rewarding or farmers will leave the land. We help to open up markets and make sure farmers get a fair price and a reasonable profit.
Renukamma Umapathi is a smallholder in southern India. At one time she was barely making a living. With training, she now earns enough to send her children to school and has been able to double the size of the family’s farm. 
Farmers are challenged to increase productivity without using more land or water. At the same time, they need to enhance biodiversity and reduce soil degradation. Through our commitments of The Good Growth Plan, we help enable growers to do all of these things when farming intensively.
Rice is a major source of nutrition, income and employment throughout Asia. We train growers to protect their crop throughout its entire life cycle, resulting in healthier plants and yield increases of up to 30%.


In northern Thailand, Khaona Sansadao is one of the small-scale rice growers using our GroMore protocol. Growers learn how to manage resources efficiently and safely. After one year Khaona achieved his largest yield yet, increasing his earnings and enabling him to provide more for his family.

Renivar Mandelo says The Good Growth Plan has “helped to open up my mind”. His coffee farm is twice as productive as the average in his home country of Brazil, making it important to the community.
Our NUCOFFEE® model in Brazil supports growers in sustainable production, ensuring traceability and increasing growers’ revenues by up to 50%. 
Our Conservando Mi Tierrita program in Colombia reduces soil erosion through tilling techniques and water use. It has increased productivity by 25-30% while reducing soil loss by 67%. 
Miguel Gil is one of the potato farmers in the Cundinamarca region to benefit. “I’ve moved from producing 400 bags per hectare to 600,” he says. ” I’m saving money and producing more thanks to Syngenta, their products and advice.”
