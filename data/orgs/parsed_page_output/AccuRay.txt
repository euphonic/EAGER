Safety Statement for Radiation Treatment:
Most side effects of radiotherapy, including radiotherapy delivered with systems, are mild and temporary, often involving fatigue, nausea, and skin irritation. Side effects can be severe, however, leading to pain, alterations in normal body functions (for example, urinary or salivary function), deterioration of quality of life, permanent injury and even death. Side effects can occur during or shortly after radiation treatment or in the months and years following radiation. The nature and severity of side effects depend on many factors, including the size and location of the treated tumor, the treatment technique (for example, the radiation dose), the patient’s general medical condition, to name a few. For more details about the side effects of your radiation therapy, and if treatment with an product is right for you, ask your doctor.

Safety Statement for Radiation Treatment:
Most side effects of radiotherapy, including radiotherapy delivered with systems, are mild and temporary, often involving fatigue, nausea, and skin irritation. Side effects can be severe, however, leading to pain, alterations in normal body functions (for example, urinary or salivary function), deterioration of quality of life, permanent injury and even death. Side effects can occur during or shortly after radiation treatment or in the months and years following radiation. The nature and severity of side effects depend on many factors, including the size and location of the treated tumor, the treatment technique (for example, the radiation dose), the patient’s general medical condition, to name a few. For more details about the side effects of your radiation therapy, and if treatment with an product is right for you, ask your doctor.

Negative consequences of improper disposal of E-products:

Burning of rubber and plastic in open areas cause air pollution.
Bad impact on human beings, animals, and other animates.
Waste of natural resources.
This initiative is the step towards a cleaner and greener earth. This move is one of the ways to show that we are concerned and thus we request all our customers to join this the movement to make it successful by way of how they dispose of their end-of-life product.
