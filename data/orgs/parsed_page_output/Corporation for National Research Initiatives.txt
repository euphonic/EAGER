is a not-for-profit organization formed in 1986 to foster and development the Information Infrastructure. Among CNRI's major goals is a program of to identify and nurture infrastructural technologies and services that will unlock the potential of information and knowledge along with technology itself. promotes various collaborative activities that create productive synergies among government agencies, universities, and private organizations; undertakes targeted in technologies information management and high-speed networking; design/fabrication support the and Nanotechnology Exchange ; and supports various educational in the public interest.
is committed to furthering the design, implementation, and deployment of selected infrastructure components so that new computing- and communications-based applications can be used to greater advantage, whether business or government at work, at school, and at home. Experimental development and use of new technologies is often the most effective means understanding their potential and driving their evolution. engages in selected system and technology demonstration activities and projects with key institutions where the implications of prototype systems can be studied and refined, and their utility can be determined.
In addition to design, development and deployment of key infrastructural technologies, initiates and nurtures collaborative and educational activities that are intended to bring together parties with potentially divergent interests to pursue common goals. also houses a program of activities to support in digital libraries and networked information technologies.
uses the frontier of Internet technology as its working environment, as its development environment, and as a laboratory "time travel" into Internet technology's future. One example of CNRI's commitment to maintaining an advanced information infrastructure is the deployment of technology to facilitate collaboration work both internally and with external organizations. Current involving frequent coordination and interaction with industry, government, and academia require that intra- and inter-site collaboration technology become a natural, well-integrated, and transparent aspect of daily work.
