History of Harvesting Technology
is a collaboratof science, technology and business professionals comprising an international think-tank dedicated to solving Humankind's energy needs on Earth and beyond - including aerospace applications.
announces a nanotechnology breakthrough capable of producing clean electricity day & night without sun or wind called Harvesting Technology. Successful proof-of-concept has been achieved (TRL-3 as defined by NASA). An Economic Viability report authored by Kennedy Space Center 2011 Scientist Engineer of the Year, Dr. Philip Metzger (one of 9 PhDs involved with this project) estimates that productversions may provide up to US$150 billannual economic benefit to the with proportionally large benefit to other countries by potentially producing electricity cheaper than solar 10 patents have been awarded by the USA, Russia, China, Canada and Japan covering the world's largest economies with notice of allowance issued in 28 European Uncountries and with patent pending status in approximately 100 other countries. An initial US$1founder's round (seed capital) funded this epic breakthrough. 2nd round is currently underway to raise $500k to conduct Cost-per-Watt studies. After Cost-per-Watt studies are complete, the revenue phase may commence via the sale of technology licenses to early adopters such as national, state and regional governments; producers including solar and wind; and military, automotive, aerospace industries as well as humanitarian projects. Harvesting Technology is poised to help reduce human suffering by increasing the quality of life for billions of people around the world through access to cheap renewable energy – day and night.
At Group, we believe that the best way to predict the future… is to invent it.

Copyright © 2018, LLCScientists have known for decades that the Earth’s atmosphere contains vast quantities of electrical power. In the early 2000’s, the researchers that would later establish theorized that useful amounts of clean renewable electrical could be harvested from naturally occurring atmospheric ions if an effective method of coupling to the atmospheric ions could be discovered. Thus began years of research into determining which materials proved most efﬁcient at coupling with the electric provided by atmospheric ions.
Group’s early research included the use of weather balloons to provide altitude to many different materials testing their suitability for coupling to atmospheric ions. Testing began in Florida over land and water, during the day and also at night. To conﬁrm that harvesting the electric charge of atmospheric ions was not a local phenomenon occurring only in Florida, testing also took place in the deserts of Nevada and at altitude on Mount Charleston.
In 2008, was awarded the ﬁrst of many patents for harvesting ionic energy from atmospheric ions for the productof electricity, as well as using ionic energy to produce hydrogen gas from water. Today, multiple patents have been awarded to by the United States, China, Japan, Canada and Russia with patentable actfiled in many other countries through the and Two years after was awarded its ﬁrst patent for the utilizatof carbon/graphite, in separate research, Professors Andre Geim Phand Konstantin Novoselov Phwere awarded the 2010 Noble Prize in Physics for research into single layer carbon/graphite.
