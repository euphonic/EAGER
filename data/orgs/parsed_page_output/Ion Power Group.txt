Scientists have known for decades that the Earth’s atmosphere contains vast quantities of electrical power. In the early 2000’s, the researchers that would later establish theorized that useful amounts of clean renewable electrical could be harvested from naturally occurring atmospheric ions if an effective method of coupling to the atmospheric ions could be discovered. Thus began years of research into determining which materials proved most efﬁcient at coupling with the electric provided by atmospheric ions.
Group’s early research included the use of weather balloons to provide altitude to many different materials testing their suitability for coupling to atmospheric ions. Testing began in Florida over land and water, during the day and also at night. To conﬁrm that harvesting the electric charge of atmospheric ions was not a local phenomenon occurring only in Florida, testing also took place in the deserts of Nevada and at altitude on Mount Charleston.
In 2008, was awarded the ﬁrst of many patents for harvesting ionic energy from atmospheric ions for the productof electricity, as well as using ionic energy to produce hydrogen gas from water. Today, multiple patents have been awarded to by the United States, China, Japan, Canada and Russia with patentable actfiled in many other countries through the and Two years after was awarded its ﬁrst patent for the utilizatof carbon/graphite, in separate research, Professors Andre Geim Phand Konstantin Novoselov Phwere awarded the 2010 Noble Prize in Physics for research into single layer carbon/graphite.
