See how we reshape the way we live our lives everyday
Story
Our beginnings were humble rocks, but after more than 100 years, we know how to rock science. Every day at 3M, we explore, we connect and we invent. And we’ve opened the door to show the world the unique, multi-dimensional ways science can touch your life.
We’ve started the conversation with a fresh new look and new way of talking about ourselves that makes us excited to share. We’ve always been storytellers and inventors at heart, but now we will show you why we do what we do. And while we may look different, we’re still the same 3M, ready to connect and work together with you to create the future.
So explore with us. We think you will be amazed by all the ways science impacts your life.
