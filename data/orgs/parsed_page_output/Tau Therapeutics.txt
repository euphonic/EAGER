From initial discovery through preclinical development to clinical trials, regulatory submission and product registration, we are harnessing world-class proprietary drug discovery platforms with the aim of halting the progression of Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases with innovative treatments and diagnostics.
The company’s novel aggregation inhibitors (TAIs) target the formation (aggregation) of protein ‘tangles’ in the brain. The spread of tangles – the main driver in Alzheimer’s disease – is strongly correlated with dementia and they can develop in the brain up to 20 years before symptoms associated with dementia develop. TAIs work by dissolving existing aggregates and preventing the further aggregation of protein from forming new tangles.
Our lead compound, LMTX®, inhibits aggregation of tau, synuclein, TPD-43 and huntingtin proteins. Patented as a novel chemical entity and chemically distinct from TauRx’s initial research compound, rember®, LMTX® has shown promise for slowing disease progression in Alzheimer’s disease and behavioural variant frontotemporal dementia.
Three LMTX® Phase 3 clinical trials, conducted in over 20 countries and involving over 1,900 patients, have recently completed. For a summary of the programme and study results, please follow this link . 
Following these Phase 3 trials, TauRx has started a new clinical trial, named For further information, and to understand the eligibility criteria for the trial, or to find a site close to you, please use the following link: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03446001?term=TRX0237&rank=5
