What we do
Our customers include all of the world's leading chipmakers, like Intel, Samsung, and GlobalFoundries, who use our product portfolio to manufacture a wide range of semiconductor chips.
Our key technologies
The heart of ASML’s product portfolio is the semiconductor lithography system. The system works with a light source, which generates ultraviolet light. This light is projected through a blueprint (usually referred to as 
mask
 or 
reticle
) of a geometric chip pattern. Optics reduce and focus the pattern onto a thin slice of silicon (the 
wafer
) that is coated with a light-sensitive chemical. The light interacts with the chemical, effectively printing the pattern onto the wafer. When unwanted silicon is etched away, a three-dimensional structure is revealed. This process is repeated dozens of times, layer upon layer, ultimately creating a grid of hundreds of chips on a single silicon wafer.
Our lithography system is a combination of high-tech hardware and advanced software, affording exact control over the shape and size of the chip patterns it creates. But to create today’s most advanced chips, the patterns and their margins for error are so small that it is no longer sufficient to look at the lithography system in isolation. That is why we enhance system performance and reliability with predictive algorithms (which optimize the blueprint of a chip for lithography) and with metrology (which measure and correct the chip manufacturing process on our systems in real-time). We call the integration of these optimizations for chip manufacturing ’Holistic Lithography’.
Our markets
Our main customer groups are makers of 
memory
 and 
logic
 chips.
Memory chips
 can store and process large amounts of data on electronic products and are usually classed as volatile or non-volatile. Volatile memories typically lose stored information when power is removed, while non-volatile memories retain their information. The main type of volatile memory is known as (Dynamic Random Access Memory), a low-cost, high-capacity chip that provides electronics with memory to help process information. The main type of non-volatile memory chip is known as Flash, which is used to  store data on electronic devices. Both and Flash chips are made in dedicated memory factories. 
Logic chips
 process information and are the brains of electronic devices. Chipmakers that design and manufacture logic chips are known as IDMs (Integrated Device Manufacturers). Contract manufacturers, known as foundries, produce chips on order for other companies.

Our history
The 1980s: humble beginnings
In 1984, Philips and Advanced Semiconductor Materials International (ASMI) created a new company to develop lithography systems. Called ASML, we began our days inauspiciously, located in a wooden shed next to a Philips building in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. That same year we launched the 2000 stepper, our first system. By 1985 we grew to 100 employees and moved into futuristic-looking headquarters in nearby Veldhoven. In 1986 we brought the 2500 stepper to market. With its superior alignment technology, it helped to build the reputation of some of today’s leading semiconductor manufacturers. In the same year we established our very close partnership with lens manufacturer Carl Zeiss, which endures today. By 1988 we had begun to make in-roads in the Asian market, after Philips established a joint-venture foundry in Taiwan. In the United States we grew from a few employees to 84, spread over five locations. withdrew from the joint venture and was bought out by Philips.
The 1990s: from helping hand to IPO
In 1991, we launched what turned out to be our breakthrough platform, the 5500, which dramatically reduced manufacturing times for our customers. In 1995, Philips sold its remaining shares and became a fully independent public company, listed on the Amsterdam and stock exchanges. It brought in the capital to fuel our growth further. We expanded our production facilities in Veldhoven. In 2000, we acquired Silicon Valley Group and added Wilton, Connecticut as an R&and manufacturing location.
The 2000s: and immersion pave the way
In 2001, we introduced the system and its revolutionary dual-stage technology. These systems expose one wafer while the next wafer is already being measured, which maximizes the productivity of the system as well as its accuracy, boosting the value of ownership for our customers. In 2007, we shipped the first 
immersion
 system (XT:1900i). With this new technology, we enabled our customers to produce even smaller chip features by projecting light through a layer of water between the lens and the wafer.
Later in 2007, we acquired BRION, a leading provider of semiconductor design and manufacturing optimization solutions. This was the start of our ‘Holistic Lithography’ strategy, which expanded ASML’s knowledge of the lithography system with critical expertise to optimize the chip manufacturing before, during and after lithography. BRION’s advanced computational models and R&teams were integrated into our Applications business line. Another key product in the early phase of ASML’s Holistic Lithography strategy was YieldStar, our metrology system which provides real-time measurements and corrections during chip manufacturing. The first YieldStar (250D) was shipped to customers in 2008.
The 2010s: the holistic era
In 2010, we shipped the first prototype Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tool (NXE:3100) to the research facility of an Asian chip maker. Marking the beginning of a new era in lithography, lithography uses light of a shorter wavelength to manufacture smaller chip features, resulting in faster, more powerful chips. To accelerate its development, a Customer Co-Investment Program was developed in 2012 with three of our key customers – Intel, and Samsung. All agreed to contribute to the R&of next-generation lithography technologies over five years, and acquired equity stakes in the company.
In 2013, we acquired 
Cymer
, the San Diego-based manufacturer of lithography light sources, to accelerate the development of We shipped the second generation system (NXE:3300) that year, with the third generation system (NXE:3350) following in 2015. lithography turned the corner in 2016, when customer began ordering our first production-ready  system NXE:3400 in batches. This system could manufacture 125 wafers per hour. 
Next to EUV, we continued to improve the performance of our immersion lithography systems. The NXT1970Ci and NXT1980Di, the work horses of the chip industry, were installed in customer factories around the world.
We expanded our Holistic Lithography portfolio in 2016 with the acquisition of Hermes Microvision (HMI), a leading supplier e-beam metrology tools. The joint and effort resulted in the first shipment of the e-beam pattern fidelity metrology system (ePfm5) in 2017. The e-beam metrology complements ASML’s fourth-generation YieldStar 375optical metrology system, which also first shipped in 2017.

Organization
We are organized in three main business lines that reflect our entire product portfolio – Deep Ultraviolet (DUV) systems, Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) systems and Applications. These business lines are supported by a number of business functions, such as Research, Sales, Operations and Sourcing. We are 
always looking for people who will join us
 in the struggle for the best idea, the best solution, the best way forward.
Development & Engineering
More than 7,000 engineers – from fields as diverse as physics, robotics, chemistry and materials engineering – work together with one goal in mind: to create a better, faster and smarter lithography system that our customers can use to mass produce their next-generation semiconductor chips. 
Click here for current vacancies in this department.
System Engineering
Our system engineers are experienced and highly trained technical architects who oversee the early design of an entirely new system. 
Click here for current vacancies in this department.
Research
smaller group of engineers work in Research, exploring future technologies and engineering options with the help of a large network of universities, research institutes and technology partners. 
Click here for current vacancies in this department.
Customer Support
Thousands of our engineers worldwide are dedicated to a simple goal: making sure that the lithography systems in our customers’ factories are up and running. In the field and in Global Support Centers on three continents, they aim to detect problems before they can impact production. If a system does go down, our specialists work together around the clock to get it back online as fast as possible. 
Click here for current vacancies in this department.
Strategic Sourcing
Manufacturing a lithography system is a complex process. With thousands of parts, most of them made by suppliers, the Sourcing team manages long-term relationships, and ensures the parts arrive at our assembly sites on time, in the right quantities and according to technical and quality specifications. 
Click here for current vacancies in this department.
Operations
Our cleanroom is where the work really comes together and a lithography system is assembled, proving that speed and accuracy are not mutually exclusive. Customers want their systems fast, but for a tool to operate with nanometer accuracy, it must be assembled, adjusted and tested with diligence and care. 
Click here for current vacancies in this department.
Corporate Intellectual Property
Innovation is our lifeblood. So protecting the inventions that make us successful is vital for our future success. has built up a strong portfolio of more than 10,000 patent rights. Patents preserve our R&investments and ensure freedom to operate, creating leverage to negotiate deals and vigorously defend lawsuits.

Transport Planning and Control
Shipping 100 tons of delicate lithography equipment halfway around the world in three fully loaded 747s – it’s all in a day’s work for Transport Planning and Control. The team not only arranges for the custom-made, air-conditioned containers holding the lithography systems to be transported by plane and truck, they also ensure the precious cargo is handled with care and not held up at customs.

Why we exist
Our vision
Our vision is a world in which semiconductor technology is everywhere and helps to tackle society’s toughest challenges. 
Our mission
We contribute to this goal by creating products and services that let our customers define the patterns that integrated circuits are made of, and we continuously raise the capabilities of our products, enabling our customers to increase the value and reduce the cost of chips. 
By helping to make chips cheaper and more powerful, we help to make semiconductor technology more attractive for a larger range of products and services, which in turn enables progress in fields such as healthcare, energy, mobility and entertainment.
Why we exist
The invention of the integrated circuit (1958) is a pivotal moment in human history. Connecting miniaturized electronic components on a slab of silicon, this first semiconductor chip ignited a race for its better, cheaper and more powerful successors.
We believe that semiconductor technology is a force for good. Without it, there would be no smartphones, internet or modern aviation to connect us, wherever and whoever we are. There would be no satellites to better understand our planet, and none of the medical technology that helps to diagnose and treat disease. 
is a key player in the fast-paced industry that makes it all happen, as we are one of the world’s leading manufacturers of chip-making machines. We provide chipmakers with hardware, software and services to mass produce patterns on silicon, increasing the value of a chip while lowering its manufacturing cost. All of the world’s top chip companies are our customers, so chances are that every single day, you use semiconductor technology that was partly made on our machines.

How we do it
Innovation is rarely a straight line. We know it takes strong partnerships, multidisciplinary teamwork and a keen focus on how we can best help our customers. We believe that even the biggest challenge can be overcome by chipping away at it, if necessary with hundreds of people over years. We love the challenges that present themselves when pushing our technology to the next level. And then we persevere to get the job done. Together. 
Open Innovation for better results
The way we work together in our ecosystem of suppliers, partners and customers is something we call ‘Open Innovation’. We are proud of this form of collaboration, which is based on building mutual trust and managed self-interest. It is a belief that has shaped from its earliest years: we have always seen ourselves as architects and integrators, inspiring our partners to innovate on the cutting edge of engineering together, each in their own strength, all the while sharing risk and reward. Open Innovation expands the knowledge and skills of all partners involved, bringing technology to a higher level faster than any one partner could have done alone. 
Sustained R&D, fast engineering cycles
We innovate across our entire product portfolio at the same pace as our customers through large and sustained investment in research and development. To accelerate our product development, we engineer in parallel what may usually happen sequentially, all the while guarding the product’s reliability, manufacturability and serviceability. This enables us to get our innovations into the hands of chipmakers faster. We collaborate closely with chipmakers to understand how our technology best fits their needs, challenges and visions of the future. It is through this collaboration and trust that we can build for today and develop for tomorrow.
Diversity fosters great ideas
The whiteboard is our favorite forum. We sketch our ideas on them, and only the best ones stay put. To get to the best ideas, we question everything while keeping an open, curious mind. We know that a great idea can come from anyone, so we foster a melting pot of different backgrounds, talents and passions. We are proud of that diversity and we know that it makes us stronger. 
We get the job done together
We innovate as one team around the world. We have a strong sense of pride, shared purpose and foster a knowledge-based culture. These are the characteristics that enable us to push the boundaries of technology further and further.
