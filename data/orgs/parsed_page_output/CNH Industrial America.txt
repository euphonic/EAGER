​Employment / Internship Contract Scam
Over time, and most recently in 2019, became aware of false job/internship communications from entities posing as our company, brands and employees. The scam asked for personal and/or financial information from job seekers and internship applicants. These electronic communications – whether by email or text message -- were not from or anyone authorized to communicate on its behalf. Nor are any of the associated documents actual or legitimate documents. Unfortunately, the tactics that scammers use constantly changes, and the scammers are difficult to identify and shut down. We urge all candidates to be aware and cautious when applying for jobs and internships.
The online website tools used in our job application process will not require you to provide your financial information; nor will it ask you to sign a "contract" if you have not already applied through the website and spoken in person with an authorized representative. Any Industrial-authorized representative will gladly give you a return phone number or email address so that you can confirm their authenticity if you have any questions about whether an electronic communication you have received is legitimate.

India generates some 620 million tons of crop residue annually, which has significant nutrient potential. The disposal of crop residue, generated in large quantities, has become a hazard as a result of on-farm burning which reduces land productivity due to its negative effects. Crop-residue burning also results in haze, leading to the outbreak of breathing ailments, particularly in northern India. The on-farm burning of crop residues has intensified in recent years as low cost and easily adaptable technologies for its handling and management are unavailable, and the window between harvesting one crop and sowing the next is extremely short. 
​In order to prevent the resultant pollution, this three-year project is focused on researching and developing a sustainable and economically-viable crop residue management strategy in the form of a sustainable business model. Dr. Indra Mani, Head of the Division of Agricultural Engineering ICAR-will lead the project. In addition to funding the entire project, New Holland Agriculture will offer its straw management equipment for research and also provide the technical input to develop a holistic straw management solution, offering technologies for crop residue management.
