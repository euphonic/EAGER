is an emerging wafer-level interconnect foundry built upon 10thinking; the philosophy of striving to achieve exponential improvements over typical industry methods. Deca’s unique approach to design, equipment, processes and operational methods delivers our customers a competitive edge with short cycle time and rapid new product introduction.
The 2018 3DInCites Awards recognize industrywide achievements in the development of heterogeneous integration with categories from Research Institute of the Year to Materials Supplier of the Year. This year, Technologies’ M-Series, a fan-out wafer-level (WLFO) packaging technology, won Device of the Year for its high reliability.
Deca's Wafer Level Chip Scale Packaging: It's About Time
Staying competitive in the market is all about time. While your competitors are still waiting for new mask sets to start a product build, Deca’s 10approach is already rolling your product off its Autoline.
Breaking through traditional cost, yield and supply chain barriers, Deca’s M-Series™ molded fan-out technology with Adaptive Patterning™ sets the stage for cost-effective high-density electronic interconnect. From next-generation single-chip packages to future panel level SoCs built from disparate silicon blocks, the unique M-Series structure frees system designers from classic substrate-based methods and the confines of monolithic silicon. Major Industry Validation for M-Series
November 27, 2018
Mentor, a Siemens business, today announced that has become the latest member of Mentor’s (outsourced assembly and test) Alliance – a program to help drive faster adoption of new, high-density advanced packaging (HDAP) technologies...is a unique, wafer-level interconnect foundry founded in 2009 with headquarters in Tempe, Arizona and manufacturing in the Philippines. The difference is in our dynamic manufacturing capability, which gives our customers the competitive edge in cycle time and new product introductions thanks to rapid time-to-market capabilities.
Built on 10thinking: The philosophy that achieving exponential improvements can only happen by shifting from conventional approaches to manufacturing Deca’s solar-inspired production line enables game-changing cycle time, while our software-driven lithography technology enables unparalleled speed and flexibility in manufacturing.
Our award-winning M-Series fan-out wafer-level technology with adaptive patterning has been adopted for high-volume mobile chip-set applications and licensed to a leading manufacturer for dual-source production.
The combination of a highly experienced management team and inventive thinking results in a strong portfolio with innovative solutions for our customers.Home
