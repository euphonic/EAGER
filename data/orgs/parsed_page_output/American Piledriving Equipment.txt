World's Largest Pile Driven by Dodecakong
Hitting the Mark with the 100Drill
Dewitt Construction had few big holes to drill in Hillsboro  Holes were 30” diameter and 85’ deep.  The 100drill was just coming out of production and this was a perfect place to put this newly designed drill.  This project in Hillsboro was in one of the facilities, and was very difficult for myself and Scotto Gray, one of the designers for this Drill, to get on site for an evaluation.  Speaking from experience, it is not every day you walk onto a job site with a “prototype” piece of foundation and the super intendant says, with a look a complete satisfaction in his eye, “don’t change a thing, this has got to be the best drill have ever used”. 

 So we watched the drill work for a couple of hours, everything going just like clockwork.  And as the drill approached the 40’ mark Jeff, the Super on site described the material from 45’ to 85’ as a very stiff clay, resembling “bay mud” as Jeff described it.  This material was so sticky and heavy that it would not carry itself up the flight, they would take 10’ bites and bring the flight out of the hole and have to remove it with a mini-excavator.  The drill has been running in 37 inch leads which the customer liked so well they are buying this set of leads. There were 60 holes drilled and the 5 inch grouting system was used to pump grout at pressures averaging 1000-1500 psi.
An Evaluation of the Impacts of Specific Anthropogenic
It is well established that certain anthropogenic noises have a severe effect on whales. Many sounds that humans introduce into the sea today are without precedent in the evolutionary history of marine mammals and other ocean life. Seismic testing associated with oil and gas exploration, military SONAR, and other industrial sources of ocean noise have injured or killed dolphins and whales in many instances. Additionally, behavioral impacts can also be severe, with animals interrupting feeding, nursing, or reproductive activity to flee from disruptive or painful sounds. There is also evidence that whales may be subject to “masking,” where some types of noises interfere with their ability to communicate with each other. As the military and industrial producers of these sounds are required by law in some countries to prevent impacts to marine mammals, there has been considerable debate and litigation in response to this continuing problem. Various mitigation schemes have been proposed, but they have not proven effective in eliminating harm to whales. Despite a wealth of information demonstrating the need to address multiple characteristics of sound, such as form, frequency, and periodicity, mitigation levels have thus far focused only on signal amplitude, or volume. Many of the studies have also been focused on physiological thresholds such as “threshold shift” using sinusoidal-derived signals which may not accurately reflect the types of anthropogenic noises to which whales are

Knowing that, Aldridge chooses and the reliability they have come to know and trust, as well as the knowledge that if something does go wrong, a foot of snow will not keep personnel from being on site and doing whatever it takes...
Us Wick Drain Drives It Home With The Largest Marine Wick Drain Job In The World
a Leland based company has just completed the largest marine barge installation wick drain project that has ever been done in the world. This project is part of the first phases of construction for a new port facility at “Craney Island” in Norfolk Virginia. under direction of president Mark Palmatier installed 12,150,000 lf of wick drains in 6 months using the wick drain installation machines.

Now that’s 6 months with 2 rigs 24 hours a day 6 days a week! That’s a lot of wick drains. The longest wick drains were 150 ft. in length. Great Lakes dredging dumped a drainage layer of sand in the proposed wick drain area with hopper barges. The wicks will be placed and more sand dumped on top of them.

In order to place the wick drains in the correct locations on the water 2 barges had to be converted to have a grid all the way through the decks of the barges using steel pipe from the top deck all the way through the bottom. Each barge had a wick drain machine / rig on the deck. The barges would be surveyed into position and secured in position, and then each machine would go down the deck installing a wick drain in each provided hole.

Once these wick drains are installed and pre-loaded the engineers predict they will have about 21 feet of settlement. These wicked areas will support a series of dikes for the new Craney Island port. If wick drains were not used the dikes would constantly be settling and would have to be maintained at a large 
/ J&110Drill Test Pile
Ebsary Foundation Company of Miami, installed the first test pile for the Army Corps of Engineers Herbert Hoover Dike Culvert 1 & 1Rehabilitation project along Lake Okeechobee in Moore Haven, this past week.  Ebsary purchased the drill late last year with a new 765 Power unit and a new Model 300 Vibratory Driver / Extractor.  The demonstration, reaction and test piles were all 24? diameter and ranged in length from 88 - 9 3 ft.  The piles took approximately 14 cubic yards of high strength grout with average drilling and pump time of 25-35 minutes. This was the first time Ebsary used their new / J&110Drill and it ran perfectly with no problems of any kind.  ?APE/J&continues to provide Ebsary with durable, reliable drills and vibratory hammers.

Northern Exposure
is again called to duty in Northern Manitoba. couple of years ago, did a 5000 pile job for a 3,000 man camp at Keeyask, where we showcased some of our pre-drilling capabilities. Now it is the coverter station at Keewatinohk, where we are pre-drilling the seasonal frost, discontinues permafrost, and some Canadian shield with our latest achievement in drilling technology, the "Polar Penetrator." This patented drag bit allows high pressure air to eject cuttings out of the hole as soon as they are loose, typically at least twice if not three times faster than conventional tools. This drilling technique, along with the "down hole" accessories , allows APE's program to stay in the lead on today's helical pile market.

©About Inc.
Inc. has a unique way of doing business in the deep foundation construction industry. We devise, manufacture, load,  and ship our own products. We don’t rely on distributors; we rent and sell directly to the contractor. We get our to the job site and we  set it up. We get our people in the field where they can help and learn.
From design to production to installation, professionals are involved.
is committed to providing outstanding products and service, and being on the job site is crucial to upholding this commitment. We learn first  hand what problems need to be addressed for a particular job before going to the engineering table to solve them. Since our machining and fabrication  facilities are in-house, we have the flexibility to respond to job situations almost instantly. Transforming a good idea into a job site reality is  our specialty.
This is the key to APE’s successful research and development program, making us the industry leader in patents issued worldwide.
revolutionized the vibrator pile driver/extractor in 1990 with the introduction of the Model 150. Over a decade later, this revolutionary  device is still the industry gold standard. The Model 150's patented technology includes a multistage suppressor for greater line pull, one-piece  enhanced heavy metal eccentric weight and gear, and height/weight adaptability for extreme job conditions. The Model 150 Vibro, in technological  sophistication and durability, is still light years ahead of the competition.
The introduction of the one-piece gear and eccentric weight eliminated unwanted bolts and connections inside the vibrator gearbox. The unique  eccentric/gear incorporates helical cut gears that are final cut using a patented procedure that provides perfect timing and balance between all  eccentrics. gearboxes have 50% less parts than the nearest competitor, dramatically improving serviceability and life.
Heavy Metal Technology
Another result of APE's drive to create more simplified, serviceable, and efficient products is the development of the heavy metal enhanced  eccentric. Each eccentric is filled with two solid lead or tungsten bars, giving them more mass. This extra mass allows one eccentric to do the  work of two, thus eliminating bearings, shafts, and other components. APE's "T" vibrators (tungsten enhanced) are the most powerful machines money  can buy.
Hydraulic Impact Hammer Technology
introduced the to Junttan hydraulic impact hammers. In response to demand for short hammers needed to retrofit work under earthquake  damaged bridges, developed its own line of hydraulic impact hammers. hydraulic impact hammers feature a patent pending double walled lifting  cylinder that raises the ram from the bottom.
This new technology reduces the overall height, making the hydraulic hammer the shortest impact hammer on the market today. low  headroom hydraulic impact hammers are revolutionizing the way contractors drive piles. The short design reduces pile splicing and allows the  driving of longer piles.
The Big Hammer
makes the largest hydraulic impact hammer in the United States. We designed our big impact hammers to run from the same power units as  our Model 400 and Model 600 vibratory driver/extractors. The new hydraulic impact hammers incorporate tiny micro electronic technology,  eliminating the need for bulky container-size power units and control rooms.
The Diesel Revolution
In May of 1997, caused another revolution with the introduction of German designed diesel hammers manufactured in Shanghai, China. These time-proven,  single acting diesel hammers are higher in quality, and lower in cost, than any other diesel on the market.
All diesel hammers feature remote hydraulic controlled fuel pumps, fast-remove trip systems, and in-line fuel filters. Each come with a warranty  package that is more than twice as long as any other in the industry. In addition, is the only manufacturer to demand alignment. This ensures maximum  energy transfer to the piling.
All diesel hammers are equipped to operate with bio-diesel fuel, which helps them run cleaner and start faster than any other diesel hammer on  the market.
diesel hammers remain the best value on the market by any standard. Constant developments by our engineering team continue to keep a step  ahead of the competition.
Drive Caps and Inserts for Impact Hammers
manufactures a full line of drive caps and inserts for any type of piling. drive caps and inserts are fully machined on all striking surfaces.  This provides superior energy transfer to the pile and prevents premature wear of the hammer. drive caps accept inserts from all major manufacturers.  However, for proper alignment we recommend using only made components. also offers machining services to upgrade your existing drive caps and inserts.
Striker Plates
striker plates are made twice as thick as our competition to prevent bending or cracks. Each striker plate is fully machined on all surfaces  and comes complete with drilled and tapped holes on both sides for easy loading and shipment.
offers cushion material such as conbest, aluminum, and high-density nylon cushion material.
Direct Fluid-to-Torque Auger Drills
introduced cam track technology to the augured-cast-in-place piling industry in 1993 when it converted a state-of-the-art Poclain hydraulic radial  piston motor into a drilling tool. The compact motor, with its revolutionary cam track roller pistons, needed only a hollow shaft and stronger bearings in  order to revolutionize the top drive auger industry. No drill on the market today has the crowd force capacity of the drill.
The cam track technology converts hydraulic fluid directly to torque without the aid of gears or planetary drives. No bull gears can be found on the  system, thereby avoiding the efficiency losses that plaque the gear reduction systems.
The drill is rugged, self-lubricating, and requires no maintenance. It can handle the abuse caused by down-the-hole hammers and it can even withstand  the impact of telescoping Kelly bar applications.
is the Largest User of Vegetable Hydraulic Oil
In 1990, was the first to introduce pile driving and deep foundation equipped with vegetable hydraulic oil. We are now the largest user  of vegetable hydraulic oil in the Our power units are designed with built-in spare oil tanks to replenish the main tank should a spill occur. has  determined that its vegetable hydraulic oil provides even better quality and performance than the most expensive petrochemical hydraulic oils. Our entire  rental fleet operates on vegetable oil. Of course, owners may use whatever oil they desire. They overwhelmingly choose 100% biodegradable oil  because they know that spills of any other type of oil are extremely costly. We choose to use vegetable oil because it makes sense environmentally and  economically.
