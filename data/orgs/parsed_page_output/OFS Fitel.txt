About With a heritage dating back to Alexander Graham Bell, has been at the forefront of optical communications technology. Headquartered in the United States outside of Atlanta Georgia, is a world-leading designer, manufacturer and provider of optical fiber, optical fiber cable, connectivity, and specialty photonics solutions.
is part of Furukawa Electric Company, a multi-billion dollar corporation that has been in operation since 1884. Since it achieved a world first in finding practical application for optical fiber cables in 1974, the Furukawa Electric Group has offered an extensive lineup of products as one of the world’s leading optical fiber manufacturers.
Our technological heritage includes not only the first commercial production of optical fibers, but also the first to market offerings for many of the fiber optic products that meet today’s industry standards. This legacy includes the first application specific fiber, the first optical connectors, the first ribbon cables, the first attenuators, the first hard clad silica fibers and dozens of additional breakthroughs that enabled the fiber optics revolution. As broadband networks are being disseminated on a global basis, and together have utilized leading-edge telecommunication technologies to the fullest to contribute to the development of next-generation communication networks.
Supporting all these initiatives is Laboratories. Bred from the technological heritage of Bell Labs and Furukawa Electric Company, Labs delivers best in class research and development to maintain our cutting edge leadership and to give value to our customers and shareholders. Labs continues to outpace the competition in design, material research and application development.
We put our development and manufacturing resources to work in applications for the home, for customer premises, through cities, and across countries and oceans. delivers solutions from the wind power farm to the surgical suite, transmitting data in harsh environments and delivering laser power in medical applications. Our products and solutions help service providers, municipalities, network operators, and home developers meet the exploding demand for bandwidth as the Internet and data communications become omnipresent worldwide. Our solutions help enable efficiency on the factory floor and reliability in emerging fiber laser applications.
Our marketing, sales, manufacturing and research teams provide forward-looking, innovative products and solutions in areas including Telecommunications, Medicine, Industrial Automation, Sensing, Government, Aerospace and Defense applications. We provide reliable, cost effective optical solutions to enable our customers to meet the needs of today’s and tomorrow’s digital and energy consumers and businesses.
Headquartered in Norcross (near Atlanta) Georgia, U.S., is a global provider with facilities in China, Denmark, Germany, Russia, and the United States.
