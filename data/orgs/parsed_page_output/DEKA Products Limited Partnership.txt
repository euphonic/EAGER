For over thirty years, Research & Development Corp. has made Manchester, New Hampshire home. Housed in the largest industrial complex of its time, the historic Amoskeag Millyard , employs a team of over four hundred professionals, whose engineering, design, manufacturing and quality expertise make a hot spot for creating innovative solutions and advanced technologies. Located about an hour from Boston, the beach, and the mountains, is one of the leading research and development companies in the country and is the birthplace of some of the most innovative and life-changing of our time.

At the age of 30, Dean Kamen sold his first company, AutoSyringe, and in 1982 he founded to focus on medical innovations aimed to improve lives around the world. In 1989 he founded FIRST® to build the next generation’s workforce. Dean continues to push to be a place where no idea seems too big and where creativity and crazy cool gizmos reign supreme.
“FIRST® is more than robots. The robots are a vehicle for students to learn important life skills. Kids often come in not knowing what to expect—of the program, nor of themselves. They leave, even after the first season, with a vision, with confidence, and with a sense that they can create their own future.”

“There are basically two types of people. People who accomplish things, and people who claim to have accomplished things. The first group is less crowded.”
