Corporate Profile
Businesses
About is a steelmaker engaged in the total steel-making process, taking iron ore raw material and turning it into final products. Boasting one of the world's greatest capacities for production, satisfies customers by producing under a corporate philosophy of "contributing to society with the world's most innovative technology." The company also contributes to environmental protection by developing reduced-impact ironmaking processes and high-performance materials.
About Iron
Iron is a fundamental material that supports industry and everyday life.
Iron is a wonderfully hard and strong material that can be processed flexibly for use in diverse applications, which is why it has been present in human civilization for millennia.
In the industrial revolution, iron played a vital role in key fields such as railroads, ships, construction and manufacturing. Steam engines and other power devices made with iron drove the development of modern civilization. In the 20th century, the widespread popularization of automobiles and consumer appliances would not have been possible without iron. Moreover, iron is highly recyclable and can be reused in any form over and over.
Currently accounting for approximately 90% of all metal products, iron underpins virtually every industry and--either directly or indirectly--is part of almost all aspects of our everyday lives.

Hidden Potential: Iron Continues to Evolve
Iron's association with ancient civilization can obscure the fact that it has evolved into an advanced material produced with cutting-edge technologies. Nonstop research and development and continuously improving production technologies are creating highly advanced products in response to industry's insatiable demand for ever-stronger and more processable materials. Continued technological innovation is expected to discover still-hidden potential within to meet increasingly stringent performance and environmental demands.
Going forward, iron's perpetual evolution will play a role in shaping our future.
Production Bases
Steel's production bases in Japan comprise large coastal ironworks in the eastern and western parts of the country, plus the Chita Works specializing in pipes and the Sendai Works for rods and wire materials. Every facility is equipped with cutting-edge technical capabilities for the exceptionally efficient production of high-quality products.
West Japan Works
The West Japan Works is one of the world's most advanced mills and one of the largest, covering a cumulative area measuring 25,100 hectares. Its production system boasts continuous, synchronized processes for ironmaking, steelmaking and rolling, and the flexibility and efficiency to meet the needs of even the most demanding customers. As the core steelworks for Steel, the West Japan Works will continue to serve as a leading edge of the global industry.

The lineup covers a full complement of high-quality products for automobiles, machinery, bearings and other applications.
Iron Powders
Steel's highly respected iron powder products are used in a broad scope of applications, including in powder metallurgy primarily for automobiles, as well as for hand warmers, welding rods, gas cutting, deoxidizers and chemical reactions.
Titanium
Titanium is a lightweight, high-specific-strength material that is extra corrosion resistant, making it ideal for use in the chemical industry. Titanium does not change over time and is recyclable, so it also is a non-polluting ecofriendly metal. Thick titanium sheets from can be found in fields such as aerospace, chemistry, seawater desalination and oceanic development.
Slag
makes slag products by processing slag, a byproduct of manufacturing, for use in diverse applications. Slag products are also valued as recycled materials that reduce environmental burdens by helping to conserve resources and save energy.
Overseas Expansion
Steel's medium- to long-term vision is to be a global supplier that constantly creates new value to grow together with its customers. To achieve this vision, one of the key strategies is to aggressively expand the company's business scale, including by statisfying growing demands in emerging nations. So far, the Japanese industry has focused largely on exporting products from Japan. However, to compete leading manufacturers, has determined that it must upgrade its global service and support offerings. Accordingly, the company is now establishing a more global network by expanding production and logistics operations directly in markets overseas.
