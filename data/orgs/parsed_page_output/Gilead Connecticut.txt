In the late 1960s two graduate students from Wesleyan University founded as a research project. They were volunteering at Valley Hospital (CVH) and noted an increasing number of individuals who kept returning to the hospital because they were faced with overwhelming odds once they returned to the community – no finances, no living situation, no employment, and no social support systems. They wanted to stop the cycle and help individuals in need. This is the foundation of Late 1960s
On June 10, 1968 House was incorporated with the primary purpose of providing a home and support in the community for individuals with severe mental illness.

Two graduate students from Wesleyan University founded as a research project while volunteering at Valley Hospital in the late 1960’s.
They noted the increasing number of individuals who were re-hospitalized because they faced overwhelming odds in the community – no finances, no living situation, no employment, and no social support systems. Quite often, this would lead to re-hospitalization and the cycle would begin again.
It was their wish to stop the cycle and to help individuals in need that formed the foundation for Gilead. Community leaders, professionals, businesses, educators, and interested individuals were approached to carry on the work of their project.
House
In 1968, House was incorporated to provide a “home” and support in the community for individuals with severe mental illness. continued to grow throughout the decades as large state psychiatric hospitals discharged patients to the community, increasing the need for community-based programs. Although grew rapidly, we continued to honor our mission-to provide broad access to a wide range of high quality and recovery oriented community mental health services .

Jeff Burgess caught the “bug” at our first annual fundraiser, Quizine for a Cause. He has been committed to Gilead’s mission ever since serving on the Board of Directors as President and as a general member since 2005. Advocacy is one of Jeff’s strengths and he can be counted on to represent Gilead’s clients at the Legislative Office Building, “makes the most of limited resources; they are efficient while also producing great outcomes evidenced in the changes in clients’ lives.”
Jeff jokes that he likes to do nothing in his spare time but he loves cooking, eating out, and fishing. Tiger Fish in South Africa is one of Jeff’s most memorable catches. Jeff loves cheerleading for his two sons, and spends any free time he has with them and his wife, Suzanne.
Jim Probolus has been involved in numerous volunteer activities in Portland — serving on the Board of Education; Portland Board; various coaching roles in Portland Parks and Recreation, as well as a volunteer on several town “task forces”. was fortunate to have him join our board in 2005.
Active in educating and meeting with local legislators to point out the impact has on people dealing with mental health issues, client needs, and issues facing the agency. Jim has a prepared and delivered testimony in Hartford.
Jim was born and raised in Worcester but has lived in since 1972. Jim and his wife are both active in their local community, enjoying time with their children and grandchildren, traveling, outdoor activities – hiking, gardening, skiing — and following women’s Basketball.
