Executive Management: Creating a planet Run by the Sun
Lynn Jurich
Chief Executive Officer
Lynn is chief executive officer and co-founder of (Nasdaq: RUN), the nation’s largest dedicated provider of residential solar, storage and energy services in the United States. With co-founder Ed Fenster, Lynn invented the business model “solar as a service” that unlocked consumer demand for clean, affordable energy direct from residential rooftops. Today with more than $3 billion in installed solar systems across 22 states and the District of Columbia, is revolutionizing how consumers get electricity. Before Sunrun, Lynn worked at Summit Partners, whereas one of few female venture capitalists, she completed investments with an aggregate market value of over $900 million in the financial services and technology sectors.

My Solar Story
"Creating a sustainable planet is both our greatest societal challenge and our greatest durable economic opportunity. decided to focus on solar when was flying back from a trip in Asia and saw the massive impact coal and pollution was having on our environment. wanted to do something at scale to help us use our resources more efficiently to support global growth. When Ed and met in graduate school and eventually decided to co-found Sunrun, 100% of people told us it was a mistake and that was crazy to leave my job in private equity. But believed in the possibility to power our entire world with the sun and wanted to build a community to do it. We believed that solar could best be used in the hands of the people, establishing a cleaner, more affordable and more resilient energy future."
Edward Fenster
Executive Chairman
Ed co-founded to make solar affordable for American families. He oversees capital raising and legislative and regulatory affairs. Under his leadership, has enjoyed uninterrupted access to project finance throughout its history.

Ed is a 2010 Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year award winner with Lynn Jurich, a member of the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, and serves as an Advisory Partner to Millennium Technology Value Partners. Disrupting the energy industry comes naturally to Ed - when Ed's preschool teacher asked him what his favorite thing was, he replied, "Electricity!"
My Solar Story
"I’ve been interested in energy my entire life, and decided to focus on solar when was in graduate school and met Lynn. We discovered we were both passionate about the environment, and finding unique solutions to complex problems. saw an opportunity to bring new financial structures to the energy sector. We decided to start with a disruptive business model; providing clean energy to homeowners without requiring them to purchase their own solar panels. We believed we could change a polluting, antiquated energy system into one that is local, responsive, and powered directly for and by consumers."

youtubeThere is a truth out there that crosses all socioeconomic and class-boundaries: all Puerto Ricans struggled with lack of power after last year’s hurricanes.
People spent every penny they could trying to keep some lights on to try and feel, at least for a few hours, that we hadn’t been somehow physically hurled back into the Middle Ages. Doing that every day was tough.
For many, this meant waiting in long lines to get scarce gasoline or diesel. For others, it meant getting 100-pound propane tanks filled at $75 a pop; none of those tanks would last much more than half a day. Even people of economic means had problems keeping the diesel flowing and their generators running long-term, given the constant maintenance required.
That is why home solar and batteries are the natural, almost self-evident energy path for Puerto Rico. I’ve often explained my feelings of amazement and fulfillment the day realized that there was a blackout in my neighborhood simply from hearing the noise of my neighbors' generators. It took me a few seconds to understand how could have power while my (noisy, expensive and polluting) gas generator was still off. It was a great feeling when realized was being powered exclusively by clean, renewable (and quiet) solar energy.
Puerto Ricans, myself included, bought expensive backup generators during and after Hurricanes Irma and María. We all accepted this as the only option, regardless of the fact that generators are dirty, expensive and sometimes dangerous.
Now we have learned that things can be different, and that there are better choices out there.
Since installed rooftop solar and a battery on my home, there have been about 8 hours of brownouts in my neighborhood. know that because a smartphone app records those events. Those are 8 hours in which haven’t turned on my expensive, noisy and dangerous generator. have saved almost half a tank’s worth of propane gas already, close to $35.
Now have a completely solar-powered energy generation system during the day, with few limitations. At night, now know that my fully charged battery will effortlessly and reliably power my critical appliances until the morning sun rises. It’s that simple.
have also become extremely aware of my power consumption, becoming more energy-efficient. I'm paying less than ever to PREPA, Puerto Rico’s only electricity provider, while sending stable, locally-generated power back to the grid.
When purchased my 17kw propane backup generator for $3,500, It seemed like a bargain. thought to myself, “that’s a lot of capacity!” Well, the truth is that it has two-settings: on or off. If it’s on, it’s burning fuel to produce 17kw of power, no matter if the load in your house is 2 or 3 kw. There is no incentive to be responsible; that tank will go at the same rate no matter what. At that rate, spent around $1,500 just on propane alone during Hurricane Maria (and that’s because got power back relatively quickly, in mid-October 2017).
Wasteful fossil fuel generators are simply the wrong way to go. don’t mean this just from a philosophical or climate-change mitigation perspective -- but from a reality that the procurement of fossil fuels during disasters is dangerously unreliable.
Many hospitals and elderly-care facilities were unable to secure fuel for their generators during and after the hurricanes, which ended up costing human lives. Local solar and batteries provide a reliable, resilient solution. Powering first responders, community centers, and hospitals with this technology is the right way to go, everywhere.
In many stateside markets, shortsighted utilities see home solar and batteries as a threat. But in Puerto Rico, our competition is also fossil-fuel based generators.
home solar and battery service with is a hassle-free,  clean and reliable alternative to a backup generator. The benefits are priceless, providing peace-of-mind and ‘energy-security.’ Rooftop solar is also truly affordable. The sun is an abundant energy source and offers households a 25 year service plan from little to no money down.  
want home solar and batteries for all Puerto Ricans. There is no reason for Puerto Rico to suffer again because of power loss. It’s also the right thing to do.
This is why I've joined the team at Sunrun. team that is doing, and will do, great things.
