Strategy
Our long-term strategy, Value Generation 2020
Sense, Think and Control.
As our society, lifestyles, and industry continue to change on a global scale, many issues have come to the surface. These include environmental degradation, depletion of resources, overpopulation and a rapidly aging population in certain regions, as well as resulting changes in supply and demand. Aiming to help address these issues in a harmonious manner, launched its 10-year management strategy, VG2020, in 2011.
