Message from Yoshihito Yamada
contributes to resolving the world's social issues through its businesses. 
Our approach to resolving these social issues is one representation of how is a corporate group that people can always depend on, and an organization that continues to live up to the high expectations of people all over the world.
Society around us has changed greatly since our company was founded in 1933. OMRON's mission, established in 1959, is "To improve lives and contribute to a better society." This is what has driven us forward and bound us together as we have pioneered the creation of "social needs" to bring about a better society. As a result, we have created products born from innumerable innovations and thus have contributed to the advancement of society and improvement of people's lives through our businesses. Since 1933, and driven by this guiding philosophy, we have grown dramatically to become a global company that now encompasses over 117 countries and regions and employs some 36,000 people.
In accord with our 10-year, long-term vision that we unveiled in 2011, called Value Generation 2020 (VG2020), we aim to become a global value-creating group that is qualitatively and quantitatively superior. From fiscal 2017, we have embarked on the final medium-term plan leading toward fulfillment of VG2020. We have named this medium-term plan VG2.0 as we aim to resolve social issues that have arisen from a global society undergoing fundamental change on an entirely different scale that has not been seen for a very long time. 
VG2.0 designates factory automation, healthcare, mobility, and energy management as the four domains in which can most readily generate value for society ahead. Focusing on these four domains, and drawing on our innovative roots in the advancement of technology around the axis of OMRON's core "Sensing & Control + Think" technology, we will link with our customers and partners to generate innovations and resolve social issues, thereby achieving further growth.
This transformative era is precisely the right time for us to "contribute to resolving social issues and improving lives through our business by putting the Principles into practice" in the aim of enhancing our corporate value.
Thank you for your continued support.

Provided they share the same philosophy, we are willing to provide any supplier, regardless of nationality, company size, previous business relationship or lack thereof, and any other status with an opportunity to join us based on the principles of free competition. Positive and excellent suggestions and presentations are welcome.
FAIR
:  Importance on partnerships that are based on fairness and equality.
In procuring component materials and services, we will select suppliers in a fair manner by not only taking into consideration product quality, price, delivery period, environmental conservation, technologies and healthy business management, but also by adding such items as compliance with laws, ordinances, and social standards.
GLOBAL
: Reliable global partners
From an international perspective, we will procure outstanding materials, parts and services from sources all over the world, in the optimal regions.
Management Policy
ECOLOGY
: Procurement activities that contribute to reducing adverse impact on the global environment.
We will actively use materials and parts that do not contain hazardous chemical substances, and promote "green" procurement that contributes to reducing any adverse impact on the environment.
COMPLIANCE
: Strict compliance of applicable laws, regulations and social standards by maintaining a high level of morality.
we will strictly observe laws, ordinances and social standards related to procurement and purchasing, and build partnerships with our suppliers. Moreover, we will appropriately manage and protect suppliers' confidential and personal information which we had obtained through our purchasing and procurement activities.

Message from Yoshihito Yamada
contributes to resolving the world's social issues through its businesses. 
Our approach to resolving these social issues is one representation of how is a corporate group that people can always depend on, and an organization that continues to live up to the high expectations of people all over the world.
Society around us has changed greatly since our company was founded in 1933. OMRON's mission, established in 1959, is "To improve lives and contribute to a better society." This is what has driven us forward and bound us together as we have pioneered the creation of "social needs" to bring about a better society. As a result, we have created products born from innumerable innovations and thus have contributed to the advancement of society and improvement of people's lives through our businesses. Since 1933, and driven by this guiding philosophy, we have grown dramatically to become a global company that now encompasses over 117 countries and regions and employs some 36,000 people.
In accord with our 10-year, long-term vision that we unveiled in 2011, called Value Generation 2020 (VG2020), we aim to become a global value-creating group that is qualitatively and quantitatively superior. From fiscal 2017, we have embarked on the final medium-term plan leading toward fulfillment of VG2020. We have named this medium-term plan VG2.0 as we aim to resolve social issues that have arisen from a global society undergoing fundamental change on an entirely different scale that has not been seen for a very long time. 
VG2.0 designates factory automation, healthcare, mobility, and energy management as the four domains in which can most readily generate value for society ahead. Focusing on these four domains, and drawing on our innovative roots in the advancement of technology around the axis of OMRON's core "Sensing & Control + Think" technology, we will link with our customers and partners to generate innovations and resolve social issues, thereby achieving further growth.
This transformative era is precisely the right time for us to "contribute to resolving social issues and improving lives through our business by putting the Principles into practice" in the aim of enhancing our corporate value.
Thank you for your continued support.

This is the first time one of the Business Awards is given to a Japanese company.
This designation came as ASEAN-recognized our contributions to job creation, human resource development and technological advancement in member countries in tandem with our collaborative efforts with regional partners and academic institutions in the fields of AI, automation, robotics and Iobased on OMRON's core technologies, "Sensing & Control + Think."
Since its founding, OMRON's mission has been to contribute to the development of society through its business operations based on the notion that a company is a public entity of society.

In our Healthcare business unit, we are working to realize our "Zero Events" initiative designed to bring the number of coronaries and strokes down to zero. For example, in Indonesia and Philippines, we are working with governments and NPOs to increase awareness of high blood pressure and heart disease. In the region, our most important manufacturing hub, we established new production and development facilities at our plants in Indonesia and Vietnam in 2017 for the growth and development of the regional society by increasing production capabilities and creating local jobs.
At the awards ceremony held on 12 November in Singapore, 4 individuals representing were in attendance including President Iitaka of President Iitaka was presented with a memorial shield by Singapore President Yacob in the presence of many guests and award recipients from over 10 member countries.
