GENERATOR
Corporation’s patented Windbeam micro generator captures from airflow to recharge batteries and power electronic devices.
The Windbeam’s novel design allows it to operate silently in wind speeds as low as 2 mph. The generator consists of a lightweight beam suspended by durable long-lasting springs within an outer frame. The beam oscillates rapidly when exposed to airflow due to the effects of multiple fluid flow phenomena. linear alternator assembly converts the oscillating beam motion into usable electrical energy. lack of bearings and gears eliminates frictional inefficiencies and noise. The generator can operate in low-light environments unsuitable for solar panels (e.g. ducts) and is inexpensive due to low cost components and simple construction. The scalable technology can be optimized to satisfy the requirements and design constraints of a given application.
TECHNOLOGYCOMPANY
Corporation is a Boston startup company that has developed the Windbeam, an innovative micro wind generator that can recharge batteries and power electronic devices. The company has an exclusive license to commercialize the generator intellectual property portfolio from Northeastern University.
The Windbeam technology has evolved from a lab bench prototype at Northeastern University to several field-demonstrated units tailored for specific applications. Energy’s R&efforts have yielded significant design and performance improvements, including faster response to low velocity multidirectional wind, increased power output, and reduced cost.
Corporation aims to capitalize on rapid growth of the Internet of Things movement and a worldwide need for clean, renewable energy.
