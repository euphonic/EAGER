About was founded with the realization that one stroke is one too many, and that any stroke has a disastrous impact on a patient’s life and family. In fact, the stroke rate continues to be too high in many interventional cardiology and cardiovascular procedures. The company founders felt that debris must be captured and entirely removed from the circulatory system in order to offer a patient optimal protection from stroke.
With that vision, was formed to develop devices that better protect patients. The company’s Sentinel Cerebral Protection System is the only commercially available technology that filters, captures and removes embolic debris released during left heart and endovascular procedures to prevent it from traveling to the brain and causing a stroke.
