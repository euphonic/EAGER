Privacy & Security
National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC., a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International, Inc., for the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA-0003525.Since 1949, National Laboratories has developed science-based technologies that support our national security. Americans depend on Sandia's technology solutions to solve national and global threats to peace and freedom. Here, portrayed in no particular order, are sixty of those solutions...
Nuclear Stockpile Stewardship
Nuclear Stockpile Stewardship
plays a key role in efforts to extend the life of nuclear weapons currently in the nation's stockpile, most of which were produced 30 to 40 years ago. is continually evaluating components, subsystems, and system performance to ensure the ongoing safety and reliability of the existing arsenal.
Satellite
Beginning with the satellite program for detecting nuclear bursts in the 1960s, has designed sensors and accompanying ground processing systems to support verification of international arms control agreements. Payloads and ground processing systems have been fielded for 23 Defense Support Program satellites and 51 Global Positioning System satellites.
Nuclear weapons security
Concerns about the safety of nuclear weapons led to Sandia's introduction in 1960 of the permissive action link (PAL), a coded electromechanical security lock preventing unauthorized use of a nuclear weapon. The development helped reassure the public that a scenario involving a stolen nuclear weapon was quite impossible.
Nonproliferation
conducts major efforts aimed at preventing the global spread of nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. Technologies range from microscopic sensors to large intelligence-gathering systems that help monitor compliance with international treaties, theft or diversion of nuclear materials, and biological and chemical weapons programs.
Nuclear deterrence
Since 1949, has applied its engineering and scientific expertise to the development, testing, and maintenance of the nation's nuclear weapons stockpile. Nuclear deterrence has long been a core element of national security strategies and played a significant role in ending the Cold War.
Multispectral Thermal Imager
In 2000, launched the Multispectral Thermal Imager (MTI) satellite — the first satellite designed and built wholly by Sandia. is still used today to monitor treaty provisions, map chemical spills, detect pollution from waste streams in lakes and rivers, and detect volcanic activity.
Antiterrorism
chemical monitoring system called has been keeping watch for the past several years over a number of large indoor and outdoor events, such as the Super Bowl, the Rose Bowl, Oakland A's baseball games, and the 2008 Democratic National Convention. is able to detect and provide early warning of airborne chemical agents that might be used in a terrorist attack.
National security
If a nuclear detonation occurs in space or the Earth's atmosphere, the Air Force is responsible for determining the event's significance using data from the Nuclear Detonation Detection System (USDNS) — a network of satellites, detectors, and ground stations. The Integrated Correlation and Display System developed at helps simplify the work of Air Force personnel by gathering, correlating, and making sense of satellite data before an operator ever sees it.
Shooter ID
Police officers are now able to instantly determine whether a suspect has recently fired a gun by using a chemical test developed by and Law Enforcement Technologies, Inc. The "instant shooter kit" detects gunshot residue in a matter of minutes, eliminating the need to wait for lab tests, which would often take weeks.
Yucca Mountain
Since the late 1970s, has been involved in various capacities with Yucca Mountain — America's first planned repository for spent nuclear fuel rods and solidified high-level radioactive waste. In 2006, was named the lead scientific laboratory for the project and continues to provide technical guidance for the submitted Nuclear Regulatory Commission license to operate the project.
Supercomputing
Sandia's Red Storm supercomputer can compute many tens of trillions of calculations in a month, making it a popular tool for government agencies, universities, and customers worldwide. Designed to run nuclear stockpile calculations, Red Storm has modeled the amount of explosive powder it would take to destroy an asteroid, how fire affects critical components in devices, and how changes in the composition of Earth's atmosphere affect climate.
Cold War cleanup
Serving as scientific advisors, scientists and engineers helped select the site for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP), provided the facility's conceptual design, and provided the scientific understanding that formed the basis for the Environmental Protection Agency's certification of in 1999. WIPP, the nation's first underground repository for nuclear waste left over from the Cold War, was constructed in salt beds more than 2,000 feet below the surface near Carlsbad, NM.
Space exploration
The ability of the Galileo spacecraft to survive Jupiter's radiation belts was made possible by radiation-hardened components designed and built by Sandians. Launched in 1989, Galileo traveled 2.8 billion miles and survived more than four times the dose of Jovian radiation it was designed to withstand before disintegrating in Jupiter's atmosphere in 2003.
Planetary exploration
When the Pathfinder spacecraft hit the surface of Mars on July 4, 1997, it bounced and rolled rather than crash landed, largely as a result of airbags designed by and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The airbags were based on parachute technology developed for nuclear weapons.
Nuclear power safety
In 1989, first released MELCOR, a computer software for analyzing severe accidents in nuclear power plants. The software — updated numerous times since then — incorporates the results of nuclear power plant safety research since the 1979 Three Mile Island accident and is the de facto standard among utilities and nuclear regulators in the and abroad for evaluating plant safety.
Hydrogen monitoring
The ability to detect and monitor hydrogen — a colorless, odorless, and flammable gas — is critical wherever hydrogen is produced, used, stored, or transported. Sandia-developed sensor, with the ability to detect hydrogen, has been commercialized by H2scan of Valencia, CA, and is now used on a variety of areas such as petroleum refining, hydrogen production, and nuclear facilities.
Cyber security
Sandia's Center for Cyber Defenders program trains students from colleges and universities to protect and defend computer systems and networks from attack. Through their projects, the students actively help secure computers nationwide.
Satellite interception
In February 2008, Sandia's Red Storm high-performance computer was used to help the military plan and carry out the successful interception of a defective spy satellite that threatened to fall to Earth. team ran hundreds of impact calculations using advanced modeling and simulation tools to determine the best way to ensure the car-sized satellite — traveling at 17,000 miles per hour and 153 miles above the Earth — was destroyed with a single missile shot.
Law enforcement
Diversionary devices, such as flash-bangs or stun grenades, that are used by law enforcement and the military to temporarily distract or disorient an adversary can result in serious injuries, because they function by creating a small explosion. has developed a safer, non-explosive flash-bang technology and in 2008 licensed it to the Defense Technology of America.
Airport chem/bio defense
Aviation security
To assess the threat of onboard explosions from terrorist bombs, developed computer models that predict the damage caused by different types of explosives in various locations of passenger aircraft. This work, done in conjunction with homemade explosives testing, is being used by the Transportation Security Administration to develop new requirements for explosives detection technology used for security checkpoints, checked baggage, and air cargo.
Antiterrorism / Aviation security
The familiar walkthrough portals at many airport security checkpoints use Sandia-patented technology to screen airline passengers for explosives. Even trace amounts of explosives on an individual's skin or clothing can be collected and identified using this technology.
Anthrax investigation
researchers assisted the in its investigation of anthrax-containing letters mailed in 2001 to several news media offices and two senators. Using advanced microanalysis tools developed for nuclear weapons work, they analyzed hundreds of samples and determined the anthrax in the letters was not prepared to disperse more readily through the use of additives — a crucial finding that helped guide the FBI's investigation.
Anthrax decontamination
In 2001, federal authorities used a decontamination foam developed at to help rid Capitol Hill buildings of anthrax. The foam — cocktail that includes ordinary household substances such as those found in hair conditioner and toothpaste — neutralizes chemical and biological agents in minutes, and is non-toxic and environmentally friendly.
Aviation safety
Airline technicians can now spot dangerous short-circuits before â€” instead of after â€” they happen. technique called Pulse Arrested Spark Discharge (PASD) reveals weak spots in wiring insulation while the plane is still on the ground.
Drinking water arsenic removal
Helping communities find cost-effective methods for removing arsenic from drinking water and meeting new federal arsenic standards was the goal of Sandia-led partnerships. Five water treatment site demonstrations were conducted in New Mexico, including two on tribal lands. Test results from the demonstration projects have been compiled on a website, examining the effectiveness of alternative technologies under a variety of site conditions, along with costs associated with each.
Bomb disablement
The shoe bomb Richard Reid allegedly tried to detonate on a trans-Atlantic flight and a device found in the cabin of convicted Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski were disabled using an advanced bomb squad tool originally developed at Sandia. The device, called the Percussion-Actuated Nonelectric (PAN) Disrupter, is manufactured by Ideal Products of Lexington, KY, and is used by bomb squads nationwide.
Columbia accident investigation
Sandia's expertise in materials and engineering science played a key role in helping determine the cause of the 2003 space shuttle Columbia disaster. Using supercomputer simulations and materials characterization experimental data, showed that the most probable cause of the accident was damage to the shuttle's wing from foam debris.
Flight 800 investigation
computer modeling efforts supported and helped guide the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation of the July 1997 Flight 800 accident, which killed all 230 people on board. The international investigative team concluded that the accident was most likely caused by unintended ignition of fuel-air vapors in the jetliner's central fuel tank, resulting in a mid-air explosion.
Explosives destruction
The Explosive Destruction System (EDS), developed by for the Army in the late 1990s, safely neutralizes and discards recovered chemical warfare material in an environmentally sound manner. The Army uses to destroy World War and World War vintage chemical warfare materials, but it can also treat biological agents, biocontaminated containers, and improvised biological devices.
Wind energy efficiency
An innovative wind turbine blade, developed by and the Knight &amp; Carver Wind Group, produces up to 10 percent more energy than traditional linear blade designs without increasing wear and tear on the machine. The 27.5-meter blade, with its gently curved tip, is specially designed for low-wind speed regions, greatly increasing the amount of land available for wind energy development.
Strategic Petroleum Reserve
America's emergency crude oil is stored in natural salt caverns along the Gulf Coast at depths up to 5,000 feet. Since 1977, has provided the Department of Energy with scientific and engineering assistance on the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR), including helping evaluate and choose additional storage sites when was increased to its authorized one-billion-barrel capacity.
Climate change
scientists are members of an international research team whose work at the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Climate Research Facility in northern Alaska is providing data for global climate models and helping transform scientific understanding of the Earth's future climate. Their work at this Department of Energy facility focuses on making long-term measurements of cloud formation and its influence on atmospheric heating.
Molten salt technology
Molten salt technology for capturing and storing the sun's heat was developed and advanced at and was an integral part of Solar Two, a solar power plant near Barstow, Solar Two produced enough power to supply 10,000 homes and operated from 1996 to 1999.
Combustion science
Since 1981, researchers at Sandia's Combustion Research Facility have developed ways to detect and measure chemical species in flames, reduce air pollution from engines and coal-powered utility plants, and characterize combustion taking place inside automobile and truck engines. They have revolutionized current understanding of combustion and continue to work with industry to develop more efficient, cleaner-burning combustion processes and devices.
Drilling technology
In the 1970s, a promising new rock drilling technology — the polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) drill bit — was introduced, but results in the field were disappointing: cutters broke, separated from bits, or wore too quickly. As a result of research, industry collaboration, and field testing, design deficiencies were identified and corrected, and now bits account for about two-thirds of all oil and gas drilling because of their efficiency and resistance to wear.
Solar power
Since 1996, has helped bring power to some 400 homes on the Navajo reservation, using solar technologies such as photovoltaics. Through the Department of Energy Tribal Energy Program, personnel provide technical assistance in procuring the equipment and teach residents how to manage and maintain it.
Military sensing
During the Vietnam War, developed a family of earth-penetrating, air-dropped sensors for use in detecting enemy forces, particularly convoys or troops moving into South Vietnam along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Capable of detecting even human footsteps, the highly sensitive seismic intrusion detectors were credited with helping break the siege of Khe Sanh in 1968.
Military support
is a world leader in the advancement of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), a type of radar able to produce high-resolution, almost photo-like images of terrain and structures through inclement weather and at night. Sandia-developed systems have been used by the military in high-profile conflicts such as Desert Storm and the Kosovo Conflict.
Computation based product design
Goodyear's Assurance TripleTred tire, Consumer Reports' most recommended all-season tire for passenger cars, was the result of a partnership with Sandia. Sandia's powerful computer codes allowed Goodyear to produce innovative tires in record times by eliminating the need for repeated prototype development, testing, and redesign.
International cooperation
Since 1994, Sandia's Cooperative Monitoring Center has brought individuals from 125 countries to neutral ground to develop technical solutions to mutual security problems. Unique in the world, the center develops and offers training in an array of technologies for improving regional security, building trust among nations, and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Iowa investigation
investigation for the Senate Armed Services Committee of the 1989 explosion aboard the Iowa found that an overram of the powder bags as the gun was being loaded was the likely cause of the explosion; the Navy disagreed, concluding the cause could not be determined. The team also found no evidence to support the theory that crew member Clayton Hartwig used a detonator to set off the explosion that killed himself and 46 other crew members.
Chemistry
In the late 1970s, scientists at Sandia's Combustion Research Facility needed a more efficient way of solving combustion problems involving complex chemical kinetics phenomena. Their homegrown code became CHEMKIN, a software suite licensed by Reaction Design and used worldwide in the microelectronics, combustion, and chemical processing industries.
Chemical attack detection
In 2003, became the nation's first permanently installed detection and response system for chemical attacks in a public facility when it was deployed in the Washington, D.C., Metro. In this multilab project that began in 1998, selected and field tested available commercial detectors and designed the advanced sensor network for the system, which also assists transit operators with emergency response to attacks, potentially saving lives.
Mine safety
The January 2006 explosion that killed 12 miners in West Virginia's Sago Mine was likely triggered by the effects of a lightning strike traveling deep into the mine, a investigation concluded. The findings were included in a report issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration, which has led to proposed new safety measures for mines.
Space exploration
After the Challenger and Columbia space shuttle disasters, needed a way to inspect the shuttle's thermal protection shield prior to landing. Sandia-developed sensor and robotic arm system, allowing the crew to check for tiny cracks and other damage, has flown on 12 space shuttle missions.
Microelectronics industry
When Sandian Willis Whitfield came up with the idea for the laminar airflow clean room, it was intended to provide a dust-free environment for close-tolerance weapons parts. Little did he — or anyone else — know that his idea would become a basic enabling technology for the $1.2 trillion electronics industry.
Aviation safety
Takeoffs, landings, pressurization, and temperature changes take their toll on commercial aircraft, causing tiny cracks in the aluminum skin that must be patched and contained. An improved fuselage patch developed by and partners Delta Airlines, Textron Systems Division, and Lockheed Martin, and approved by the FAA, repairs cracks using a flexible composite material instead of the old riveted metal plates, which can cause cracks themselves.
Asteroid tracking
global team that included Sandians Mark Boslough and Dick Spalding was able for the first time to detect and track an asteroid heading toward Earth in October 2008 and predict its time and place of impact. While the small asteroid posed no danger, the ability to provide early warning could be critical for larger asteroids, which strike the Earth a few times a century.
Cryptology & authentication
Retired cryptologist Gustavus Simmons pioneered the theory of authentication, used to verify adherence to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty for nuclear weapons. All e-commerce now depends upon Simmons' work in authentication.
Modern electronics
In the 1980s, scientist Gordon Osbourn originated the field of strained layer superlattices by making the first calculations to predict their unique electrical and optical properties. This work led to revolutionary advances in electronics and optoelectronics.
Next-generation microelectronics
milestone in microprocessor technology was achieved in 2001 when Sandia, Lawrence Livermore, and Lawrence Berkeley labs, and a consortium of chipmakers developed and demonstrated an extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUVL) system for producing the next generation of more powerful microchips. enables patterning of silicon wafers with a much shorter wavelength of light than current systems, enabling more densely packed transistors and therefore higher speeds and better performance. It is forecast to be in commercial use by 2013.
Airbag sensors
Invented in the 1960s by Sandian Don Wilkes, rolamites were used to trigger the deployment of automobile airbags until they were replaced in the mid-1990s by electronic triggering sensors. Originally developed to detect a nuclear warhead's acceleration pattern, the rolamite switch is a basic mechanical device consisting of a roller suspended within a tensioned band.
Digital paleontology
In 1997, scientists at and the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science recreated a vocalization of a crested dinosaur that lived 75 million years ago. Using powerful computers, computed tomography (scans), and a rare Parasaurolophus skull, they produced a low-frequency rumbling sound that the dinosaur could have made.
Employee giving
Since Sandia's employee giving plan started in 1957, employees and retirees have provided at least 15 percent of the United Way of Central New Mexico's annual contributions, with a total of more than $55 million donated to date.
Economic development
In 1998, broke ground for the Science & Technology Park — a 200-acre technology community that provides tenants with easy access to world-class technologies, facilities, scientists, and engineers. Today, the park is home to 28 companies and employs about 2,300 people, with an average wage of $70,400, compared to an average of $37,300 for the Albuquerque metropolitan area.
Small business assistance
Since 2000, has provided technical assistance to more than 1,455 businesses, courtesy of the New Mexico Small Business Assistance program, which provides the lab with gross receipts tax credits for help provided. Projects have ranged from assisting Rio Nambe Pueblo in creating a water distribution model to analyzing metals used in locomotive repair for the Cumbres & Toltec Scenic Railroad.
Community support
In 1956, two scientists decided to buy new shoes for needy children instead of exchanging gifts with one another. Their grassroots effort continues to this day as a corporate-sponsored project and to date has provided new shoes for more than 11,500 Albuquerque children.
Automated wheelchair cushion
Pressure sores among wheelchair users are a common problem, often leading to serious complications or death. and Numotech, Inc., have developed a wheelchair cushion based on microprocessor-controlled inflatable air pockets that inflate and deflate to help prevent and heal pressure ulcers.
Mold control
decontamination formula developed at to render harmless a wide variety of chemical and biological agents also combats a common household problem — mold and mildew. Mold Control 500, licensed to Modec, Inc., and distributed by Scott's Liquid Gold, is based on Sandia's "decon foam" and is available in hardware stores nationwide.National Laboratories

National Laboratories is a multimission laboratory managed and operated by National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC., a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International, Inc., for the Department of Energy’s National Nuclear Security Administration under contract DE-NA-0003525.National Laboratories' roots lie in World War II's Manhattan Project, which built the world's first atomic bombs.
...Our history reflects the changing national security needs of postwar America. Although originated as a single-mission engineering organization for nonnuclear components of nuclear weapons, today it is a multiprogram laboratory engaging in research supporting a broad spectrum national security issues.
began in 1945 as Division, the ordnance design, testing, and assembly arm of Los Alamos National Laboratory. It became Laboratory in 1948 and, in 1949, was established as a Western Electric company to manage the laboratory. second site was opened in California's Livermore Valley in 1956. More than two decades later, in 1979, Congress made a Department of Energy national laboratory. became a wholly owned subsidiary of Martin Marietta (later Lockheed Martin Corporation) in 1993. On May 1, 2017, National Technology and Engineering Solutions of Sandia, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Honeywell International, Inc., assumed management of Sandia. Show more

July 12, 1945
Site selected for newly established Division of Los Alamos
Sandia's forerunner, the new division gathered the ordnance engineering, testing, assembly, and military liaison activities into one group. Jerrold Zacharias was placed in charge of the new division. The first Division sub-group began moving to the new site near Albuquerque in September.
The site selected for Division was part of land acquired by the military in January 1941 to establish a training facility for bomber pilots, as well as a training center for aircraft mechanics and air depot personnel. The Air Depot Training Station, referred to as Albuquerque Army Air Field and located in the area that later became Sandia, was established in May 1942; the program ended in 1943 and a convalescent center was established on the site in mid-1944.  On July 14, 1945, the Corps of Engineers requested transfer of jurisdiction of Albuquerque Army Air Field from the Air Technical Service Command to the Engineers, Manhattan District. The transfer was effective on July 21, 1945; the site was subsequently referred to as Base.

About
Long-term management aimed at preserving and enhancing the quality of the environment has evolved at National Laboratories for more than 50 years. Recycling, establishing community environmental partnerships, incorporating sustainable design in new and renovated facilities, and environmental restoration are all integral parts of Sandia's environmental stewardship.
also partners with the Department of Energy to improve public participation in environmental issues, such as the implementation of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and Long-term Stewardship for environmental restoration. Participation in community organizations and committees that have an environmental and planning focus, such as Shared Vision, the Middle Rio Grande Council of Governments, and the Albuquerque Chamber of Commerce, is a key component.

About
tradition of employee giving
National Laboratories employees and retirees are generous, contributing over $5 million a year through the United Way of Central New Mexico to nonprofits in New Mexico, California, and the nation. Giving is a tradition at Sandia. In the 1960s, employees initiated the Shoes for Kids Program. Rather than giving each other gifts during the holidays, employees elected to contribute to a fund to provide new shoes to local elementary school children. The program provides a new pair of shoes to over 500 Albuquerque-area children each year. Other annual programs benefiting local students include book and school supply drives.
During the holidays, New Mexico employees enjoy the opportunity to provide gifts for more than 600 children who are living in foster care. California employees celebrate with the Holiday Spirit Campaign to distribute food to local food banks and provide gifts to nearly 500 needy families.
Our onsite blood drives are a unique giving opportunity at Sandia. These convenient events facilitate the donation of over 1,000 units of blood per year, enabling employees to provide more blood to our community than any other organization in New Mexico.

About
Inspiring the next generation of scientists and engineers
National Laboratories provides innovative, science-based, systems-engineering solutions to our nation's most challenging national security problems. The declining numbers of American students who pursue science and engineering degrees is a national concern. Encouraging students to pursue science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) careers is the goal of our K-12 education programs.
Elementary school children are fascinated with the unexpected, as are scientists. One of the challenges with elementary school children is discovering ways to engage students with hands-on math and science activities that encourage them to test theories, not just memorize facts. Our elementary school programs focus on providing inquiry-based activities that emphasize the fun of science.
Family Science Night
Family Math Night
Middle school and high school students are exploring potential career choices. These students benefit from experiences that reinforce the importance of science and engineering, and allow them to visualize themselves in a career. Our middle and high school programs, led by professionals, focus on providing more in-depth science and engineering experiences.

World-class scientists and engineers come to to conduct breakthrough research in nuclear weapons. designs more than 6,300 parts of a modern nuclear weapon's 6,500 components. Our state-of-the-art laboratories facilitate 
large-scale testing
 and computer simulation.
Sandia’s work is of the highest consequence and those doing the work face awesome responsibilities. Unlike other national labs, which focus on the physics package, Sandia’s work is to 
weaponize
 the physics package. must ensure that the other 95% of the weapon’s parts work perfectly at every point of contact with the delivery systems. This requires the broadest competencies in engineering, with a deep science foundation.
At the core of Sandia’s nuclear weapons program is warhead systems engineering and integration. It includes these products of weaponization: arming, fuzing and firing systems; neutron generators; gas transfer systems; and surety systems.
History
Sandia’s contribution to the nuclear weapons enterprise has changed through three major eras:
Cold War:
 Design, development, and testing of increasingly sophisticated weapons and more precise delivery systems.
Stockpile Stewardship
 (1992-present): Development of increasingly sophisticated tools to meet the challenge of preserving the aging stockpile in the absence of nuclear explosives testing (last test: Divider, Sept. 23, 1992). This work includes major diagnostic tools such as the 
machine
 and enormous advances in supercomputers and 
modeling and simulation
 to enable virtual testing of stockpile weapons.
Modernization:
 (present forward): Modifications and upgrades of aging weapons through life extension programs to improve surety and ensure safety, security and reliability.
Deterrence
President Obama, in his 2009 Prague speech, “
World Without Nuclear Weapons
,” described his vision for a reduced role for nuclear weapons in the national security policy. He also stated, "...as long as these weapons exist, the United States will maintain a safe, secure and effective arsenal to deter any adversary, and guarantee that defense to our allies..."
plays a key role in this principle of extended deterrence. Our annual assessment of the stockpile, and the increasing importance of life extension programs and modernization, gives a unique position and increases the national impact of the Labs’ mission.
