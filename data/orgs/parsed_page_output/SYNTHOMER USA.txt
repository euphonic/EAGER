Why join My About is one of the world’s leading suppliers of Acrylic and Vinyl emulsions polymers, speciality polymers and Styrene-Butadiene and Acrylonitrile-Butadiene latex. We are the market leaders in many market segments including coatings, construction, technical textiles, paper and synthetic latex gloves. 
Within this broad range of applications our aqueous polymers are used to deliver one or both of the following two main functions: they can be used as an impervious barrier, such as the manufacture of thin latex gloves. Or they bind materials and substances together. For example sticking glass strands together which are used in modern housing insulation materials or to provide the right properties to pressure sensitive adhesives that are used to make foil sleeves for tablets and smart phones and a wide range of adhesive tapes. For some products, like in specialist paints, our aqueous polymers ensure both of these functions are achieved, as they provide a barrier, bind the paint components, and stick the paint to the wall. 
are headquartered and stock listed in the and we have more than 20 operational sites in 14 countries of the world with a significant presence in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The Company generates revenue in excess of £1.05 Billion and employs 2800 people worldwide.

Our approach
has introduced Principles and 10 Golden Rules across all sites to directly target and improve the safe operation of our plants. 
Key practices and programmes 
management practices and systems are embedded throughout the Group to provide a framework for continuous improvement in performance. Key performance indicators and audit results are reported to the Board, the Executive Committee and to the regional management meetings on a monthly basis. Should a significant incident or injury occur, it is thoroughly investigated; lessons are learned and improvements put in place to ensure that it does not happen again.
Principles and 10 Golden Rules
Synthomer’s 10 Principles and 10 Golden Rules, launched under the slogan “We always have time to work safely”, are now an integral part of how the Group operates.
Our Safety, Health and Environment principles have been launched across all sites. The principles are:
Look after yourself
Look after each other
Effective last line of defence
Stop and think
Safe workplace
Safe vehicle, safe driver
Safe processes and operations
Safe systems of work
No change without assessment
Learning from our mistakes
Synthomer’s 10 Golden Rules consolidate some basic best practice guidance for all employees:
1. Do not access working areas without the required general and/or task-specific PPE
2. Only carry out routine tasks for which you are trained and authorised, and use the specified tools and equipment for the job.
3. On stairs and steps – take one at a time, using handrails where present.
4. Only drive vehicles for which you are authorised, and follow all signs and rules.
5. Do not by-pass safety devices or interlocks without prior authorisation.
6. When a work permit is required, ensure it is valid and complete, and do not deviate from its requirements.
7. Lock out and tag out all energy sources before working on equipment.
8. On tankers and other vehicles, ensure the fall protection and/or handrail system is in place before accessing the top.
9. Do not make any change, or carry out any non-routine work without following an accepted system with an appropriate assessment and authorisation.
10. Immediately report injuries, incidents and near misses to your line manager.
As a member of the Chemical Industries Association, embraces the principles of 
Responsible Care
, the chemical industry’s commitment to continual improvement in health, safety and environmental performance. We manage all aspects of our activities so that we provide high levels of protection for employees, customers, the public and other stakeholders, and for the environment.

successful business built upon engaged, capable people
At Synthomer, we realise that selecting and nurturing successful employees is the key to developing a successful business. We are continually working hard to improve Synthomer’s people agenda, implementing a consistent grading structure, an exciting graduate recruitment programme, succession planning and focused bonus scheme, all designed to support and underpin the future growth of the Group.
 employs approximately 2,800 employees, spread across 25 manufacturing sites and offices. Part of the heritage of is the cultural diversity across the Group. We continue to embrace diversity as an equal opportunity employer and have increased the number of women in senior management roles.
 Our Human Resources team has developed a framework to encourage employee growth and productivity. The framework comprises five elements, supported by an open and positive working environment, policies and processes, and an integrated Business Partnership team. 
Attraction and retention
Our aim is to attract, select and retain the best people by enhancing our employer brand, improving selection techniques, and continuing the development of a vibrant and challenging yet supportive culture. We recruit, train and promote employees according to their achievements and commitment, treating employees equally, regardless of their race, national origin, religious affiliation, gender, sexual orientation, disability, age or background.
Reward and recognition
We strive for fair and transparent mechanisms for staff recognition and reward. Reward is linked to a global performance management process that tracks achievement of objectives, together with the way that these are delivered. The global bonus system aligns performance, where practicable, with targets that the employee can impact. All staff have safety targets in their bonus scheme and the majority of staff that are based at local manufacturing operations have and targets aligned to their local site and business unit.
Organisational effectiveness
With an emphasis on productivity and the alignment of our Human Resource capital with value adding contributions towards the business, we have developed robust performance management principles, supported by training in aspects such as managing effective performance and coaching for performance. Succession planning has been a significant area of focus, with an emphasis on senior management levels. Business and functional leadership has been strengthened to support delivery of the ambitious organic and acquisition growth plan.
Learning and development
The Human Resources and Operational Excellence teams have developed simple leadership attributes based on best practice within the chemical industries. These complement work done within the regions and will, together with past performance, form the basis for selection and development of current and future leaders. This approach is also being embedded into the revamped Global Graduate Development Programme. 
Leadership development
Underpinning all of these pillars is our commitment to support and challenge authentic leaders who are focused on empowering staff and helping them to understand and grow their contribution to the Group and its stakeholders. Our culture continues to thrive and encourages employees to perform and to grow, encouraging leaders to treat others as they would like to be treated themselves and also to lead by example. Organisational climate surveys, 360° feedback, coaching and mentoring are all used to support our leaders and help them understand their strengths and weaknesses.

Synthomer’s commitment to full compliance with chemicals legislation
Synthomer’s Regulatory Affairs team uses a mix of scientific, legal and corporate awareness to ensure the Company’s products are developed and manufactured in line with industry and government standards. The team is committed to ensuring our products are all compliant before they are allowed to enter the marketplace. To do this, they work with Synthomer’s business units, production sites and R&centres to ensure full compliance. In addition the Regulatory Affairs team is active in several industry and market based groups to ensure that remains one step ahead of legislation changes that may impact customers and our business.
compliance
is committed to achieving full compliance with the requirements. We believe that provides with the opportunity to add to our excellent record of regulatory compliance and Responsible Care®, and that working closely with our suppliers and customers is key to ensuring compliance.
has taken all necessary steps to ensure that has become an integral part of our ongoing business throughout pre-registration, the three transitional phase-in registration deadlines, and beyond. We make sure that our activities are fully in line with the Cefic guidelines. 
The vast majority of our products fall within the Polymer Exemption and, aside from ensuring that the individual substances contained in the mixture are registered in their own right for the required use, most of our products therefore require little further assessment to comply with the current legislation. We do however review our full product portfolio to identify products that do not meet the Polymer Exemption criteria so that appropriate action can be taken for those materials.  
Your partner for safe materials handling
The Classification, Labelling and Packaging of Substances and Mixtures legislation (CLP) aims to implement the United Nations’ Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) within the legislation replaced the Dangerous Substances Directive (67/548/EEC) and the Dangerous Preparations Directive (1999/45/EC) and will amend (EC) No.1907/2006. 
is committed to achieving full compliance with the requirements in close cooperation with our suppliers and customers. We have established a project team to ensure that the duties under the Regulation and the deadlines that apply to under the transitional periods of are clearly understood and adhered to. 
The vast majority of products fall under the definition of mixtures and, as such, the majority of our actions were scheduled to meet the 2015 deadline. Where has an obligation to report certain substances to the Classification and Labelling (C&L) Inventory, these will be met.
