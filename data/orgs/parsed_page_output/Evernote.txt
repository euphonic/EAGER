Not so long ago, capturing ideas meant having to stop and jot it down on paper before you forgot it. Clipping web pages? You had to bookmark it or take a screenshot. Saving and sharing files with a project team meant trading office docs via email, never sure who had the latest version.  Then came Evernote.

With 8 billion notes created by 225 million people worldwide, it’s easy to see why Evernote’s products have become the default place for individuals and teams who want to remember everything, turn ideas into action, and work better together.
