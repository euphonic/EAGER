Patient Access Philosophy

PHILOSOPHY
is committed to making the therapies we develop available to those who will benefit from them
was founded in 2002 with the ambitious goal of developing an entirely new class of medicines based on a major scientific breakthrough called interference (RNAi). Patients, caregivers, and advocates have been unwavering partners, standing beside us as we work relentlessly to develop investigational therapies to help people with serious and life-threatening diseases. We deeply value these partnerships. We remain steadfastly committed to understanding patient needs and how to best address them.
Here at Alnylam, we all live by a shared Philosophy when it comes to patient access: our therapies must get to those who will benefit from them. We consider this Philosophy as our compass, guiding how we will behave and the decisions we will make. We are establishing our Patient Access Philosophy before we have an approved medicine because we know that, too often, patients have trouble accessing the medicines their doctor prescribes. We have come too far and there is too great of a need for our future medicines to accept this situation for our patients.

What our Philosophy means for the people who matter most—
Patients come first.
 We are actively listening to the challenges patients and their families face and we are seeking solutions. Every day, we are working with doctors, insurance companies, and other payers to increase awareness of rare diseases to improve diagnosis and care so that patients can live healthier lives.
For example: At Alnylam, we’re dedicated to getting medicines to patients as quickly as possible, because we know every day matters. We are building a team dedicated to answering patient calls for help in gaining access to prescribed medicines. Their job will be to roll up their sleeves, answer questions, and support patients in securing access to our medicines. This team will be committed to serving the best interest of patients through personal, one-on-one interactions.
Innovation is key in everything we do.
 We are working as quickly as possible to develop new, innovative medicines that have a powerful and positive impact on lives. And, we are determined to apply this pioneering spirit to our next mission of ensuring that patients have access to our approved therapies whenever they are prescribed.
For example: We will work with insurers on creative new strategies to get patients the medicine prescribed for their condition. Our medicines will be priced responsibly, meaning they will be priced in light of the value delivered and in consideration of the rare disease markets we serve. We will grow through continued scientific innovation – not arbitrary price increases. Specifically, we will not raise the price of our medicines over the rate of inflation as determined by the consumer price index for urban consumers (roughly 2.2% currently).
Accountability is a must.
 We will fight for policies that promote better medicines and faster patient access to them. We will address and seek solutions to financial barriers to access. And, we will report our efforts to you, and be transparent about what is working and what isn’t. Despite having not yet made a profit, we’ll invest our minds, hearts, and resources – more than $375 million dollars last year alone – in research and development because, if we succeed, we believe we will transform medicine and patients’ lives.

Biotechnology: Saving Lives & Transforming Healthcare in the 21st Century
Modern biotechnology is a young industry. But in just a few decades, the entrepreneurs, scientists, researchers and investors working in this field have firmly established themselves at the forefront of medical innovation.
Their work is transforming the way we treat – and now even cure – patients with a wide range of once-devastating diseases. And these visionaries are only getting started. All across the country today, there is work being done in labs that, if successful, will benefit patients and society for generations to come.
The key now is to ensure that these men and women have the tools, the resources and the policy and regulatory environment they need to harness an improved understanding of science and to transform that knowledge into the cures and therapies that patients are counting on.
We have committed ourselves to fostering workplace development, diversity, and inclusion at and across the biotechnology industry. We are dedicated to being at the forefront of efforts to develop a diverse and talented global workforce. Read our statement about diversity and inclusion  here . We also support the (Workforce Development, Diversity, and Inclusion) principles adopted by BIO, which you can learn more about  here .
Punching Above Their Weight
Biotechnology’s strong track record can be traced directly to the men and women working in the field. For them, biotechnology is not just an occupation; it is a mission and a calling to solve the greatest challenges of our time: To unlock the essence of life itself and to use what they learn to treat and cure disease. These individuals are entrepreneurial. They are risk takers. They are driven by science and are stubborn in their refusal to accept human suffering or the status quo.
Their passion and perseverance is why about 70 percent of the biopharmaceutical industry’s clinical pipeline is attributed to small companies. The vast majority of the companies working on groundbreaking medical innovations in biotechnology are small, pre-revenue enterprises. Their success in getting new cures and therapies across the finish line rests on one key factor: the ability to attract the enormous amounts of private capital required to fund these challenging and incredibly risky endeavors.
This ability, in turn, depends on a public policy environment that supports innovation and incentivizes such investment, including continued advancement of scientific understanding; strong intellectual property (IP) rights and a reliable system for transfer, licensing, and collaboration; an efficient and predictable regulatory review process; and transparent payment systems that reward innovation and encourage free market competition.
To learn more about the impact of biotechnology on patients and society, as well as the factors needed to keep the innovation engine running strong, go to  www.innovationsaves.life . And to get recent materials about innovation and the healthcare ecosystem, go to  https://www.bio.org/4. There also is  drugcostfacts.org , a one-stop shop for factual information and answers to some of the most hotly debated questions regarding the role of prescription drugs in our nation’s health care system. You also can visit  Action , a new on-line advocacy tool that allows you to contact your federal, state or local elected officials to share your views via e-mail or social media.
