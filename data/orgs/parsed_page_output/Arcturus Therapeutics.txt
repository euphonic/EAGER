LUNAR®-mediated delivery of into cells
particles associate with the cell membrane of a target cell of interest and quickly enter the cell via endocytosis.
Upon entering the cytosol, the formulations then become trapped in the endosomes.
With increased acidity as the endosome ages, a pH-mediated disruption enables release of the payload following rapid biodegradation of the components.
Once release of the into the cytosol occurs, the translational machinery can interact with the and processing and/or trafficking can then take place to make functional protein.
LUNAR® lipid mediated delivery enables delivery of medicines.
