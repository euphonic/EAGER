Founded in 2005, Power, Inc. is the brainchild of Dr. Sam Weaver and Dan Hensley, who have developed a renewable energy system designed for producing inexpensive hydrogen on demand from biomass and waste sources. Dr. Weaver and Hensley have a long, 40+ year history of developing successful and innovative technological products from the ground up, including:
Aircraft brakes for the Boeing 767 and 777, plus military aircrafts
The first 2800production furnaces for high strength, high modulus carbon fibers
Ceramic punch technology and equipment to make Coors the thinnest aluminum beer cans in the world
Neutron absorbers for nuclear plants with 87% worldwide market share
Test and research reactor fuel which provided radioisotopes that served 10 million people annually
Today, Dr. Weaver and Hensley lead an experienced management team with extensive manufacturing experience at Power. The staff of more than 135 employees includes more than 25 talented engineers and scientists.
Facilities
has a strong physical presence with 5 locations, and more than 142,000 square feet of manufacturing and office space on 161 acres of land.
Promise
PPI’s patented CHysystem is proven to positively impact your company’s bottom line, whether you’re looking to address a sustainability initiative or undertake a business investment opportunity (or both). 
As a business owner and decision-maker, the CHysystem will help you control energy costs and make expenses predictable - while demonstrating to your customers that you are leading by example in the drive for sustainability.

Pro-Cene: Graphene from the pro-cene story...
Graphene is truly a wonder material. It is 100 times stronger than steel, it conducts electricity 1000 times and heat 20 times better than copper, and it is used to make supercapacitors.  Its potential applications are almost unlimited.  However, the use of graphene today is practically non-existent, because it is very difficult and expensive to produce using currently available production techniques.
is out to change all of that. 
has developed a process to produce Pro-Cene, a graphene or graphene-like material, with properties consistent with the best graphene materials being sold commercially.  is set up to produce Pro-Cene at production levels consistent with it’s utilization in high volume products.
Fully utilized, graphene has the potential to change the world.  At Power, Pro-Cene is opening the door to that change.
If you would like to purchase Pro-Cene or for further information about Pro-Cene, please use
