Capabilities:
Unmanned  Unmanned  capabilities have been transformational in the past ten years. For nations in a  more contingent posture, it is going to be more critical than ever to be  ‘eyes-on’ while maintaining the potential to be ‘hands-on’. We have stepped up  our capability to meet these challenges. Not only can offer  the ultimate ‘eyes-on’ capability with the combat-proven Global Hawk high  altitude long endurance unmanned surveillance platform, but we also provide  medium altitude solutions such as the operationally deployed rotary wing Fire  Scout system. Global Hawk has also been adapted to respond to the Navy’s  Broad Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS) requirement and and  the Navy are well into the initial flight test programme for the Triton  In addition to humanitarian assistance and supporting disaster relief efforts,  Global Hawk has logged more than 100,000 flight hours, 75% of which have been  on active deployment over battlefields in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya. And  beyond ‘eyes-on’, our ground breaking X-47development project is regarded  as leading the way in future ‘hands-on’ unmanned technology.
Cyber & Civil Security
Defence and security now form a continuum, with  cyber and civil security requiring the integrated capabilities of military,  civil authorities, and intelligence agencies to combat highly dynamic and  complex threats. works seamlessly across this spectrum,  leveraging our technology across domains. Whether in identity management and  access, surveillance and intelligence gathering, continuous monitoring, insider  threat detection, network defence, management and exploitation of massive  datasets, command and control systems, or network architectures, we are  breaking down the intellectual challenges posed by ephemeral cyber and digital  threats and establishing robust infrastructures and intelligence services to counter  them. 
C4ISR
Fully integrated battlespace networks have been a vision for many years but progress  in realising this vision has been slow. In the aftermath of recent conflicts  the challenge is to bring the lessons learned back into core defence programmes  so that future operations are served by networks already configured to support  high tempo, dynamic, complex operational scenarios in remote environments. Harmonised  and architectures, standardisation and ubiquitous communications are  all fundamental to delivering effect in future conflicts, especially where  nations are operating in concert. Grumman’s core skills in information  systems, communications networks and truly open system architectures which are  sensor, effector, and system agnostic are without parallel. Our proven and  fielded information and integrated communications networks demonstrate  how we are leading the market.
Land Environment 

  Today,  operations in the land environment are dominated by the need for pervasive communications  and the ability to move large amounts of data and information at high speed to a  huge diversity of users. Grumman’s core capabilities and experience in  data management, open-system networks, tactical communications and joint  environments unsurprisingly position us as a leader in land C4ISR.
Maritime Environment

   has a long history in supplying advanced maritime C4systems. We are  leaders in marine navigation systems, integrated platform management  and integrated bridge systems, maritime command and control applications,  underwater including wet-end sensors and signal processing for submarines  and mine countermeasures.
Air  Environment


  Grumman’s air C4capabilities range from the most advanced EO/and radar  sensors, and highly innovative airborne communications technologies, through to  integrated such as the Litening targeting pod and F-35’s mission systems.  Our C4are installed and deployed on numerous mission-critical air platforms  around the world.
Space Environment

  Our  C4extend into space; from secure military SatCom payloads,  operational planning systems, engineering, spacecraft manufacturing,  precision sensors, space instrument design to ground stations development and  orbiting space platforms, Grumman’s space capabilities cover a galaxy  of mission types.
Logistics
Our innovative logistics solutions enable effectiveness  and global mission readiness – while remaining cost-effective and affordable. From  modernisation and sustainment such as the F-16 radar upgrade, supply chain  management, training and simulation to special fit and automated test  equipment, we offer a full-spectrum of support to meet any mission requirement. Behind every product and service you’ll find a team of experts with front-line experience,  prepared to provide support wherever the mission goes.

Corporate Citizenship
People. Corporate Citizenship at starts with people. The people in our communities, the people we employ and the people that may become part of our workforce.  How can we make the lives of the people in our communities better, safer, successful and more resilient? and its employees aspire to do just that by contributing their time, talent, dollars and passions to strengthen the communities where we work and live. Providing a warm meal to someone in need, seeing the smile on a child’s face as they discover the wonder of STEM, helping wounded service members transition to a new career, making our parks and waterways clean and safe; this is at the heart of what we do.

Our volunteerism and outreach initiatives align with our strategic focus areas: K-12 education , support to our military and veterans , health and human services and environmental stewardship .

Giving back to the local community is a great way to meet and network with other employees, team build, learn about commitments the company has made to strengthen our communities and develop leadership skills. Our one-stop resource for volunteerism, Volunteer1NG, can be found on the My Giving portal . Volunteer1allows employees to look for volunteer events in their area. In addition, while in the My Giving portal, employees may create volunteer events in the "Event Management" tab and log their volunteer hours in the "Log Hours" section.

Volunteer communication and recognition is extremely important to the success of our programs. We recently established a volunteer networking web site that allows our employees to be matched with volunteer opportunities in their communities and get a community-wide understanding of needs.
Our Community Service Grant program provides a grant to the non-profit organization that an employee volunteer is committed to. We also recognize outstanding volunteers across the company through annual appreciation events.
