ESGCorporate Philosophy
On the occasion of our 60th anniversary, we have set forth a new corporate philosophy, corporate ideals and basic corporate social responsibility policy to achieve the innovation and growth that will lead us into the future.
Kaneka's Corporate Philosophy
With people and technology growing together into creative fusion, we will break fresh ground for the future and tie in to explore New Values. We are also committed to challenging the environmental issues of our planet and contribute to upgrading the quality of life.
Kaneka's Corporate Ideals
Toward an Even More Impressive and Productive Future
Hold in your hands the future you have always dreamed of. We are a highly perceptive and collaborative value-creating group or, as we like to say, a "Dreamology Company."
*"Dreamology" is an expression coined from 'dream' and 'ology' (science). Our "Dreamology Company" is a "highly perceptive and collaborative value-creating group."
Tie to the future
As a research and development company brimming with creative energy and passion, we will create future-oriented businesses that leap beyond current market needs and back them up with new product development, thus protecting the global environment and contributing to the quality of life.
Tie to the world
We are determined to become a truly global enterprise with diverse human resources working together on a global scale. Our presence will be felt in markets around the world, including newly emerging ones.
Tie with value
We are proud of our unity and identity as the Group and will take on the challenges of value creation and business innovation through close collaboration.
Tie for innovation
We will never cease to pursue innovation, fusing wisdom from both internal and external sources without getting caught up in organizational compartmentalization and conventional ways of doing things.
Tie with people
We in the Group believe that the wellspring of corporate growth resides in human resources and will continue to seek innovation as we cultivate and nurture our valued employees.
Charter (Putting the Corporate Philosophy Into Practice)
We offer solutions characterized by value to global markets and contribute to the evolution of lifestyles and the environment through innovative chemistry.
We bring innovation to lifestyles and the environment by harnessing the unlimited potential of chemical materials to help communities achieve sustainability. (Earthology Chemical Solution)
By adopting a unified approach to food and medicine that is defined by a focus on chemistry, we provide innovative solutions that empower people to live healthier lives. (Active Human Life Solution)
We fulfill our social responsibility by empowering individual employees to put our corporate philosophy into practice through serious, forward-looking effort.
We actively contribute to our communities by cultivating understanding of the cultures and customs of the countries and regions where we do business and by pursuing corporate activities that are deeply rooted in those communities.
We operate our businesses in a fair and impartial manner based on the principles of free competition and legal compliance.
We’re committed to communicating with shareholders and other stakeholders and to making information about our operations available in a timely and appropriate manner.
We strive to foster an organizational culture that respects the personalities and uniqueness of all employees so that they can enjoy good health, feel motivated, and make the most of their abilities.
Reflecting a commitment to make safety the top priority in our operations, we work to create safe and healthy workplaces, ensure product safety, and protect and preserve the environment.President's Message
Paving the Way to a Sustainable Future as a Solution Provider through innovative chemistry
Society and business environment are transforming rapidly throughout the borderless world. To realize a sustainable society, efforts for finding solutions towards environment, energy, food and health issues are being accelerated. While the effects on climate change caused by CO2 emission and global warming are serious, there is growing awareness of the need for humanity to protect the global environment. Standing at the important turning point only once in a hundred years, new and promising business opportunities are opened up to the chemical industry thanks to a technology innovation.
We, Group, have established Charter following our corporate philosophy: “With people and technology growing together into creative fusion, we will break fresh ground for the future and tie in to explore New Values. We are also committed to challenging the environmental issues of our planet and contribute to upgrading the quality of life”. To intensify and promote our activities on “Environment”, “Social”, and “Governance”, our Charter guides the actions of every individual in our organization. As an R&D-oriented material manufacturer, we will achieve innovation and create new technologies to solve social problems. And we will provide valuable products and system making full use of such technologies. In this manner, we will contribute to making our society sustainable as well as achieve our growth.
We revised our management systems in April 2017 to advance our policy as a Solution Provider. Nine business divisions have been renamed Solutions Vehicles (SVs), regrouped into four Solutions Units (SUs): Material SU, Quality of Life SU, Health Care SU, and Nutrition SU.
Kaneka’s new Medium-term Management Plan (introduced in April 2018) has improved the management system reform of 2017 and reaffirms our commitment as a Solution Provider to contribute to the advancement of life and environment of people worldwide, delivering valuable solutions through chemistry. We are reinforcing dedications to solve issues such as protection of the environment, energy saving, innovation, comfortable life, food production and nutrition, aging societies and advanced medical treatments. Setting up the main drivers for future growth – “R&D”, “globalization”, and “human resource development” – we aim to strengthen our business approach from market/customer-oriented viewpoint, improve the productivity of our entire value chain, and accelerate the glocalization.
Group is committed to meeting its stakeholders’ expectations and becoming an estimable company with competitive business structure by solving society’s problems.
We would appreciate your continued support and guidance.
