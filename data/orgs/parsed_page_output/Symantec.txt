View More Zero Trust is an architectural model that guides security teams on how to apply Zero Trust tenants to address the modern threat landscape. The model advocates a holistic approach to information security and puts special focus on processes and technologies that secure your data, wherever it resides.
The objective is to strengthen data security and obfuscation – to limit risk derived from excessive user privileges and access. Benefits also include improved security detection and response with analytics and automation.
Understanding key concepts at a high level is one thing.  Properly implementing the model can be much more challenging.
Join us in this webinar where we’ll look at:
• Requirements for adopting a Zero Trust model across the entire security stack
• Key considerations as you plan your Zero Trust programs
• Benefits of a platform versus fragmented approach
You’ll gain valuable insight whether you’re well on your way to Zero Trust implementation or are just considering it.

Trust is Fundamental to Our Business
Committed to safeguarding privacy and personal data
Protecting your most valuable assets is at the heart of our business, and remains vigilant about safeguarding your data and the privacy of the individuals it represents.
Data and its protection are at the center of everything we do: Our business is built on security, compliance, and accountability, enabling us to protect our customers’ most valuable assets.

Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)

The 
Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program
, or FedRAMP, is a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. This approach uses a “do once, use many times” framework that saves an estimated 30-40% of government costs, as well as both time and staff required to conduct redundant agency security assessments. Fedis the result of close collaboration with cybersecurity and cloud experts from the General Services Administration (GSA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense (DOD), National Security Agency (NSA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council and its working groups, as well as private industry.
Goals
Accelerate the adoption of secure cloud solutions through reuse of assessments and authorizations
Increase confidence in security of cloud solutions achieve consistent security authorizations using a baseline set of agreed upon standards to be used for cloud product approval in or outside of FedRAMP
Ensure consistent application of existing security practice, increase confidence in security assessments
Increase automation and near real-time data for continuous monitoring
Benefits
Increase re-use of existing security assessments across agencies
Save significant cost, time, and resources – “do once, use many times”
Improve real-time security visibility
Provide a uniform approach to risk-based management
Enhance transparency between government and Cloud Service Providers (CSPs)
Improve the trustworthiness, reliability, consistency, and quality of the Federal security authorization process
Main Players
Main Players There are three main players in the Fedprocess: Agencies, CSPs, and Third Party Assessment Organizations (3PAOs). Agencies are responsible for selecting a cloud service, leveraging the FedProcess, and requiring CSPs to meet Fedrequirements. CSPs provide the actual cloud service to an Agency, and must meet all Fedrequirements before they implement their services. 3PAOs perform initial and periodic assessment of systems per Fedrequirements, provide evidence of compliance, and play an on-going role in ensuring CSPs meet requirements.  Fedprovisional authorizations (P-ATOs) must include an assessment by an accredited 3to ensure a consistent assessment process.
Key Processes
Fedauthorizes cloud systems in a three step process:
Security Assessment:
 The security assessment process uses a standardized set of requirements in accordance with using a baseline set of 800-53 controls to grant security authorizations.
Leveraging and Authorization: 
Federal agencies view security authorization packages in the Fedrepository and leverage the security authorization packages to grant a security authorization at their own agency.
Ongoing Assessment & Authorization:
 Once an authorization is granted, ongoing assessment and authorization activities must be completed to maintain the security authorization.
Governance

Fedis a government-wide program with input from numerous departments, agencies, and government groups. The program’s primary decision-making body is the Joint Authorization Board (JAB), comprised of the CIOs from DOD, DHS, and GSA.  In addition to the JAB, OMB, the Federal Council, NIST, DHS, and the FedProgram Management Office (PMO) play keys roles in effectively running FedRAMP.
Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates
is committed to developing technology solutions that are accessible to persons of all abilities. To that end, we utilize the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template (VPAT™),  developed by the Information Technology Industry Council, to assist government contracting officials and other buyers in making assessments of the accessibility features of our products and services.
Release of a VPAT, however, does not constitute a certification by that procurement of any electronic and information technology would comply with the requirements of Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 § 794 (d)).

Common Criteria
The international Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA) brings together 26 nations who agree to accept a unified approach to the evaluations of information technology products and protection profiles for information assurance and security. This arrangement benefits member nation governments and other customers of products by creating more clarity in procurement decisions, more precision in evaluations, a better balance of security and features, and more rapid access to products from industry.
As the basis for the international standards ISO/IEC15408 and ISO/18045, Common Criteria is a framework in which:
government, military and other users can 
specify
 their security 
 and 
assurance
 requirements through the use of protection profiles,
vendors can then 
implement
 and/or make claims about the security attributes of their products,
and testing laboratories can 
evaluate
 the products to determine if they actually meet the claims.

Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 140-2 (140-2)
140-2 Product Status

Federal Information Processing Standard 140-2 (140-2) validation is important to any vendor selling cryptography to the Federal market space. If your product utilizes any form of encryption, it will likely require validation against the 140-2 criteria by the Cryptographic Module Validation Program (CMVP) run jointly by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in the United States and Communications Security Establishment (CSE) in Canada before it can be sold and installed in a Federal agency or Dofacility.

140-2 describes Federal government requirements that products should meet for Sensitive, but Unclassified (SBU) use. The standard was published by the NIST, has been adopted by the CSE, and is jointly administered by these bodies under the umbrella of the CMVP.

The standard defines the security requirements that must be satisfied by a cryptographic module used in a security system protecting unclassified information within systems. There are four levels of security: from Level 1 (lowest) to Level 4 (highest). These levels are intended to cover the wide range of potential applications and environments in which cryptographic modules may be deployed. The security requirements cover areas related to the secure design and implementation of a cryptographic module. These areas include basic design and documentation, module interfaces, authorized roles and services, physical security, software security, operating system security, key management, cryptographic algorithms, electromagnetic interference/electromagnetic compatibility (EMI/EMC), and self-testing.  Please refer 
here
 for additional information regarding 140-2 requirements, including links.
Validated Products List
Listed below are the products with a status as to whether a listed product is:
140-2 validated
