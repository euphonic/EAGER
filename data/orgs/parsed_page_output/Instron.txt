Our Company
While researching replacement materials for parachutes, two scientists discovered that no testing machine was accurate enough to meet their demands. They founded in 1946, and we pioneered universal testing machines featuring strain-gauge load cells. Today, remains committed to delivering the highest quality, leading-edge technologies and services designed to push the boundaries of research, quality control and service-life testing.  Our systems evaluate the mechanical properties of materials and structures using tensile, compression, flexural, fatigue, impact, dynamic, torsional and multi-axial loading. Through a global infrastructure, we offer a broad range of local service capabilities, including calibration, verification, training, technical support, and assistance with laboratory management
