is a semiconductor materials and intellectual property licensing company focused on deploying its proprietary technology into the $350+ billion semiconductor industry.
Previously known as Mears Technologies, the company was founded in 2001 by Robert Mears with a vision to develop a platform of materials technologies for use across multiple industries.  In response to the slowdown in the advancement of Moore’s Law, used atomic level material science to develop Mears Silicon Technology™ (MST®) which provides multiple benefits to industry participants.  For semiconductor designers MST® improves performance and power efficiency while potentially reducing cost.  For semiconductor fabs, the technology may allow them to extend the life of their expensive manufacturing facilities by providing a new, unexpected suite of material improvements within existing process nodes.
After several years of research to perfect the technology, is now engaged with leading semiconductor companies to integrate MST® into their manufacturing flow.  On August 5, 2016, completed an initial public offering and trades on the Nasdaq stock exchange using the ticker symbol ATOM.
