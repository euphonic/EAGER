Hitachi Hitachi (GEH) is a world-leading provider of advanced reactor technology and services.RESOURCES
Hitachi is an important part of the communities we work and live in.
We take our responsibility to be a good steward of the environment and community seriously. We are dedicated to being a good neighbor and employer.
Our world headquarters in Wilmington, is nestled on more than 1,600 mostly wooded acres. The site is Forest Stewardship Certified by the North Carolina Forest Service, with more than 1,300 acres of preserved land adjacent to the Cape Fear River. Environmental experts closely monitor our activities at our sites and in the surrounding areas and communities through water, air, soil samples and other means.
Hitachi volunteers around the world have helped restore local coastal ecosystems, rebuilt affordable housing, mentored students in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and assisted with career counselling and development in addition to supporting local and national charities including Work on Wilmington, the Food Bank of Central & Eastern North Carolina, Surfers Healing, Habitat for Humanity, Relay for Life, North Carolina Coastal Federation and many others.
Each year, Hitachi employees volunteer thousands of hours, supporting these and other important programs.
Hitachi’s efforts to protect the environment and invest in our communities have never been greater than they are today. It is our honor and responsibility to give back to the places we work and live.
Hitachi Hitachi (GEH) is a world-leading provider of advanced reactor technology and services.power is a clean and efficient way of boiling water to make steam, which turns turbines to produce electricity. Except for the reactor itself, power stations work like most coal or gas-fired power stations.
power plants use low-enriched uranium fuel to produce electricity through a process called fission—the splitting of uranium atoms in a reactor. Uranium fuel consists of small, hard ceramic pellets that are packaged into long, vertical tubes. Bundles of this fuel are inserted into the reactor.
single uranium pellet, slightly larger than a pencil eraser, contains the same as a ton of coal, 3 barrels of oil, or 17,000 cubic feet of natural gas. Each uranium fuel pellet provides up to five years of heat for power generation. And because uranium is one of the world’s most abundant metals, it can provide fuel for the world’s commercial plants for generations to come.
power offers many benefits for the environment as well. Power plants don’t burn any materials so they produce no combustion by-products. Additionally, because they don’t produce greenhouse gases, plants help protect air quality and mitigate climate change.
When it comes to efficiency and reliability, no other electricity source can match nuclear. power plants can continuously generate large-scale, around-the-clock electricity for many months at a time, without interruption.
Currently, supplies 12 percent of the world's electricity and approximately 20 percent of the in the United States. As of 2014, a total of 30 countries worldwide are operating 435 reactors for electricity generation.
For decades, and Hitachi have been at the forefront of technology, setting the industry benchmark for reactor architecture and construction, and most importantly, helping utility customers operate their plants safely and reliably.
