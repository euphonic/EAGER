What is License Management Services?
brochure (PDF)
License Management Services (LMS) is the established authority on licensing policy. We provide customers with an open, transparent, and definitive assessment of their compliance position. We achieve this with an engagement process that's designed to help customers measure actual usage versus their contractual entitlements, and to address the operational and financial risks associated with any unauthorized deployments.
Customer-First Approach
The strategic goal of is to consistently deliver best-practice audit experiences to our customers. This is done by developing more trusted working relationships with organizations and delivering an efficient audit process that, upon completion, leaves them in a stronger position for the future. It’s an approach designed to inspire a more proactive form of license management and to help customers validate the effectiveness of their internal controls, and through them, to maintain a compliant position.
"Working with License Management Services has provided the governance team with a wealth of information relating to products and significantly added value to our business."
—Jo Harris, Governance Manager, Shared Services, Britvic plc
Our Strategic Priority: Helping Customers Minimize Risk
Managing multiple licensing terms and conditions while maintaining an accurate, up-to-date view of usage can be a challenging endeavor. It’s also becoming increasingly difficult as environments move to the cloud, become ever-more virtual, and are constantly impacted by changes to organizational structures. 
As a result, customers can become noncompliant without even realizing it, due to end-user behavior or a misinterpretation of their contractual entitlements. At we appreciate that most instances of license overusage are unintentional, yet we have an equal responsibility to protect Oracle’s intellectual property.
That's why our services are focused on collaboration and prevention, as well as enabling
Empowered customers with the visibility to proactively maintain their compliance position
Access to verified usage data that demonstrates the validity of internal controls
"License Management Services provided deep expertise and objective advice. We expanded our knowledge of licensing, optimized our investment, and ensured compliance, thereby, reducing legal and operational risks."
—Dr. Joerg Meyer, Executive Director Services Group Infrastructure, Aurubis AG
Leading Through Experience
As an organization exclusively focused on license management, operates independently from any ongoing commercial discussions. Our services are delivered by a global team of highly experienced and knowledgeable consultants who collectively offer unrivaled knowledge on all aspects of Oracle’s licensing policy.

Compliance
Oracle’s Supplier Code of Ethics and Business Conduct requires our suppliers to observe the law and conduct business in an ethical and responsible manner. Where local laws are less restrictive than Oracle’s Code, suppliers must comply with the Code, even if their conduct would otherwise be legal. Where local laws are more restrictive than Oracle’s Code, suppliers must always, at a minimum, comply with the law. Where permitted by law, we enable the anonymous reporting of noncompliance incidents through the Integrity Helpline.
In addition, has adopted the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC) Code of Conduct and actively participates with other industry groups to leverage industrywide approaches aimed at reducing duplicative efforts and promoting continuous improvement in factory working conditions across the electronics industry.

For this reason, we include these topics in our annual hardware supply chain surveys. also participates in the Energy Saving Opportunity Scheme (ESOS) industry report, leveraging best practices identified in the United Kingdom to improve energy efficiency across our direct hardware supply chain globally.
Responsible Sourcing
Through Oracle’s Supplier Social and Environmental Responsibility programs, we manage and monitor our direct hardware supply chain, leveraging the Code of Conduct.

In 2016, we established a goal to survey our direct hardware suppliers and manufacturers that collectively represented at least 85 percent of our total direct hardware supply chain expenditure. We exceeded this goal, ultimately receiving responses from first-tier suppliers representing approximately 90 percent of our direct hardware supply chain expenditures in 2016.
continues to be an active member of the Conflict-Free Smelter Initiative (CFSI) established by the EICC.
Anti-Human Trafficking

In 2015, the strengthened its stance on this issue, banning the payment of employers’ or agents’ recruitment and related fees by workers.

Data infrastructure powerhouse brings together three Fortune 500-size organizations onto Cloud to deliver greater business intelligence, agility and value to its customers
Redwood Shores, Calif.—Nov 30, 2018
Western Digital Corp (NASDAQ: WDC) selected Cloud to help modernize its business processes as part of its digital transformation journey.

Western Digital decided it needed a modern suite of best-in-class applications that would enable it to enhance the customer experience and achieve a competitive advantage while improving employee productivity. After careful evaluation, Western Digital selected Cloud , which has allowed it to seamlessly extend its on-premises applications to the cloud and establish a modern business platform that can seamlessly scale to support its future expansion plans and new technology innovations.
“The process of rationalizing three large legacy systems and associated applications gave us a unique opportunity to drive change, as more than two thirds of our organization would have to undergo change no matter what application we selected. We needed a simple, yet scalable cloud platform that could power our rapidly growing business,” said Steve Phillpott, at Western Digital. “With Cloud we have been able to consolidate applications, automate key financial workflows and radically improve productivity. has been the catalyst for change and is pivotal in our digital transformation journey.”
“The technology industry is an incredibly fast-paced and competitive market, where the quickest, most agile players win. Western Digital has done an incredible job bringing three large enterprise organizations onto a single Fortune 100-scale platform to significantly improve efficiency and business agility,” said Rondy Ng, senior vice president, Applications Development. “With Cloud, Western Digital will be able to continually take advantage of the latest innovations to gain a competitive advantage and successfully position itself for future growth.”
