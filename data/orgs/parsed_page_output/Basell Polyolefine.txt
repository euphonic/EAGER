Predecessor company scientists Karl Ziegler and Giulio Natta make breakthrough discoveries in the creation of polyethylene (PE) and polypropylene (PP). and resins are used today to make numerous products, including automobile parts, surgical gowns, children’s toys, wind turbines and water pipes. They were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1963.
1955
Hoechst, a predecessor company, initiated industrial-scale production of in Frankfurt, Germany.
1969
Predecessor company, Atlantic Richfield Company (ARCO), develops the PO/process (propylene oxide with tertiary butyl alcohol as the co-product). is used in numerous applications including bedding, furniture, carpets and car seats. and its derivatives, which includes oxyfuels, are used in high octane gasoline blending components, synthetic rubber and lubricant additives.

California Transparency in Supply Chains Act
California Transparency in Supply Chains Act
The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (the “Act”) entered into effect on January 1, 2012. The law requires manufacturers and retailers to make publicly available information related to their efforts to eradicate the risks of slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains. Although Lyondelldoes not currently:
verify product supply chains to evaluate and address these risks,
conduct audits of suppliers to evaluate supplier compliance with company standards regarding these risks,
require all of our direct suppliers to certify that the materials incorporated in our products comply with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking in the countries where they do business,
maintain internal standards and processes for employees and contractors who fail to meet company standards regarding these risks,
provide training for employees who have direct responsibility for supply chain management on this subject matter,
Lyondellis committed to conducting business in an ethical and responsible manner, which includes complying with applicable slavery and human trafficking laws. Most of LyondellBasell’s direct suppliers are located in the United States or in Western European countries that have extensive laws prohibiting slavery and human trafficking.   Lyondelldoes not typically have direct relationships with suppliers in at-risk countries identified in the Department of State’s 2018 Trafficking in Persons Report and the Department of Labor’s 2016 List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor.
Below are the Lyondellprograms and standards that reflect the objectives of the Act:
Customs – Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT)
Lyondellhas actively participated in the C-program since 2003. C-is a voluntary government program designed to increase security throughout the global supply chain. The C-program involves risk-based audits of the company and unannounced audits of suppliers. 
Authorized Economic Operator (AEO)
Lyondellhas actively participated in the program since 2010. Like C-TPAT, is a voluntary program administered by member countries that requires high quality internal processes to ensure the integrity of the global supply chain.  The program involves internal audits as well as verifications of supply chain security and random on-site audits performed by the customs authorities.
LyondellBasell’s Purchase Order Terms and Conditions
LyondellBasell’s purchase order terms and conditions require suppliers to comply with all applicable laws, including forced labor and human trafficking laws.
LyondellBasell’s Code of Conduct
LyondellBasell’s Code of Conduct embodies our dedication to conducting business ethically and responsibly by obeying the law and enabling a safe and productive work environment. LyondellBasell’s Code states that “we take great care to uphold human rights in all of our operations and facilities, regardless of local custom.  Our Company does not use child or forced, indentured or involuntary labor.” 
All employees, officers, directors, and anyone doing business on behalf of Lyondellare expected to know and abide by this Code at all times. Rigorous training on the content and application of the Code is mandatory for each and every employee, and each employee must periodically acknowledge that they have read, understood, and agree to comply with the Code. Lyondelltakes seriously and fully investigates all potential Code violations. The failure to report any suspected Code violation or misconduct immediately may also be considered a violation of the Code. When an allegation of an employee Code violation is substantiated, the relevant management team reviews the investigation findings and determines disciplinary action consistent with the severity of the violation. Disciplinary action can include verbal or written warning, suspension with or without pay, demotion or, for the most serious offenses or repeated misconduct, employment termination.

Lyondellis committed to conducting its business in an ethical and responsible manner and in full compliance with all applicable laws.
In some countries in which we operate, serious challenges must be tackled, such as bribery and corruption. By setting clear guidelines, we ensure that all employees understand our expectations concerning acceptable business practices.
LyondellBasell's 
Code of Conduct
 covers topics such as fair and accurate business dealings, corruption, health and safety, discrimination, and environmental protection. To ensure that all employees understand their obligations, the Code is available in 18 different languages. The Code of Conduct document is supplemented by an on-line training module and is distributed to all our employees annually. Should employees have concerns about violations of company policies or the law, they may report the issue to their supervisor or manager, representative, or any member of the Legal or Compliance Department.

LyondellIndustries (NYSE: LYB) today announced net income for the third quarter 2018 of $1.1 billion, or $2.85 per share.  Integration activities related to the acquisition of Schulman are on schedule and estimated to have generated $32 million in forward annual run-rate synergies.  The quarter included $53 million of transaction and integration costs, which decreased earnings by $0.11 per share.  Third quarter 2018 was $1.7 billion.
"LyondellBasell's resilient global portfolio continued to deliver strong profitability, which generated third quarter that exceeded last year's quarterly results in four segments. Our olefins and polyolefins business in the Americas achieved improvements in chain margins and volumes that overcame third quarter headwinds from rising feedstock costs and new supply to drive increased profitability for the segment.  Robust global demand supported attractive margins and earnings for our Intermediates and Derivatives segment.  In our Technology segment, increased licensing of LyondellBasell's polyolefins technologies generated through the end of the third quarter that exceeded all previous full-year records while our focus on operational improvements at our refinery continued to yield meaningful results," said Bob Patel, LyondellCEO.
"Our company surpassed significant milestones on our value-driven growth initiatives during the third quarter.  In August, we completed the acquisition of Schulman, launched our new Advanced Polymer Solutions segment and advanced our organic growth program with the groundbreaking of our new propylene oxide plant," said Patel.
OUTLOOK
"LyondellBasell's feedstock flexibility and balanced portfolio of global businesses provides competitive advantage during these periods of increased volatility in energy, natural gas liquids pricing and global trade.   We are well-positioned to capture value with expanded access to markets and increased synergies from the integration of Schulman and the formation of our new Advanced Polymer Solutions segment.  During the fourth quarter, we will advance our growth projects and expect to drive further operational and business improvements in our Intermediates and Derivatives, Refining and Technology businesses," Patel said.
