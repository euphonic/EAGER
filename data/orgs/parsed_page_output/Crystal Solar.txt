has developed a breakthrough monocrystalline Silicon wafer technology  which fundamentally alters the cost-efficiency equation for photovoltaics.  This R&100 award winning, Direct Gas to Waferâ„¢ technology allows for high-efficiency panels at radically lower costs with:
50% less silicon usage compared to conventional silicon due to the kerfless nature
Demonstrated cell efficincies of > 24%
At least 10% increase in power at the module when compared to conventional mono silicon photovoltaic       technology
Less than 50% of the capital cost compared to conventional monocrystalline silicon wafer technology
The company has established  a semi-automated pilot line to demonstrate the manufacturing-worthiness and  scalability of this technology.was  founded in 2008 and has developed a breakthrough manufacturing technology  called Direct Gas to Waferâ„¢ that allows for direct conversion of feedstock  gas to mono crystalline silicon wafers by high throughput epitaxial  growth.  By skipping the polysilicon,  ingoting and wire-sawing steps altogether, our patented approach results not  only in the lowest cost/watt for wafers but also significantly reduces the  capital required to set up a manufacturing plant. 
These so called kerfless wafers have achieved  well over 24% efficiency in  customer trials and are now enabling existing crystalline cell and module  makers to significantly enhance their power output while reducing cell making  steps, thereby radically reducing the cost structure of panels.
