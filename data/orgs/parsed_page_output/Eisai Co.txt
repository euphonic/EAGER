Eisai's corporate philosophy includes the realization of human health care (hhc).
Based on a clear understanding that patients as well as their families and consumers are the key players in healthcare, we seek to have a sense of pride in providing benefits to such persons. This philosophy is summarized by the term “ hhc .”
We believe that in order to truly consider the perspectives of patients and their families, it is important for each employee to first get close to patients and see the situation through their eyes to learn to pick up on thoughts and feelings that might not necessarily always be expressed in words. It is this concept that is the starting point for all of Eisai's corporate activities. Accordingly, the Group recommends that all of its employees spend 1% of their working hours with patients.
Our corporate philosophy is understood and internalized by each employee within the Group, both in Japan and overseas. This understanding is then shared and implemented in the daily business activities of all employees, and serves to effectively transcend nationalities, national borders, and gender and age.
We fulfill our obligation to society by considering the perspectives of patients, their families and the global community overall, developing a response to their needs, verifying the social benefits of this response, and finally by making this response available to the world before anyone else.
This is the hhc that aims to realize.
The Group's Philosophy Logomark combines inspiration from the life and dedication of Florence Nightingale (1820-1910), who made enormous contributions to the development of the nursing profession and public health, with our own hhc philosophy. As such, the script for the logo is modeled on the signature of this prominent figure, who we regard as having played an immense role in the history of modern-day nursing.This website is for shareholders, investors, and members of the media.
