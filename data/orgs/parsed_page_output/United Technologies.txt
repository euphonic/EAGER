Political Activities – Policy & Oversight
and its employees have a legitimate interest in participating in public policy debates. UTC’s government relations initiatives are intended to educate and inform officials and the public on a broad range of public policy issues that are important to its businesses. These initiatives are consistent with the interests of UTC’s shareowners, and are not based on the personal agendas of individual directors, officers or employees, and typically do not include political contributions.
All of these activities are pursued in accordance with the standards articulated in UTC’s Code of Ethics , which states: “will comply with all national, state and local laws regulating UTC’s participation in political affairs, including limitations on contributions to political parties, national political committees and individual candidates.”
policy also encourages its employees in their personal capacities to engage in political activity by contributing financial and other support to candidates and political parties of their choice, participating in local political activities, voting in elections, attending caucuses and conventions, and seeking and holding public office. Employees engaged in these activities must do so on their own time and not as representatives of (or otherwise on behalf of) UTC, and may not use UTC’s resources (e.g., work time, email, administrative staff, etc.) to undertake or facilitate such activities.
The   Board of Directors “reviews and monitor[s] UTC’s conduct of government relations activities, including the activities of any political action committees.”  The Governance and Public Policy Committee  of the Board of Directors reviews and monitors “UTC’s policies and practices with respect to contributions to charitable, educational and other tax-exempt organizations involved in the arts, civic and community affairs, education and health and human services.” These reviews also include state political activities, 527, 501(c)(4) and similar contribution activities.
UTC’s federal lobbying activities and expenditures can be reviewed in detail via its Federal Lobbying Disclosure Act filings .
UTC’s state lobbying activities are subject to regulation and reporting in virtually every jurisdiction in which the company or its affiliates do business. As a general rule, the company’s state lobbying efforts are restricted to issues involving building safety and related building codes (e.g., smoke/CO2 detector legislation, elevator and other safety codes); economic development; and various business regulation issues that arise during legislative sessions in key states where the company maintains a substantial business presence (i.e.,  California ,  Connecticut ,  Florida ,  Georgia ,  Illinois ,  Minnesota ,  New York ,  Tennessee ,  Texas and   North Carolina ). UTC’s lobbying activity reports for these states can be accessed by clicking on the name of each state.

The Steering Committee considers the following factors in deciding the timing and amount of contributions to candidates:
The candidate's views (and voting record, in the case      of incumbents) on issues critical to UTC's success;
The presence of facilities in the candidate's      district;
The congressional committees on which the legislator      serves (in the case of incumbents); and

Enterprise Risk Management
Share
Main Content
At UTC we aim to be world-class in everything we do – including our compliance with and other national laws. Every employee is responsible for ensuring that UTC’s business is conducted in compliance with these laws and with UTC’s Code of Ethics.
UTC’s Enterprise Risk Management assessments measure compliance risks, deploy risk mitigation plans and track implementation for five key areas:
Antitrust 
has an aggressive antitrust compliance program that promotes and protects competition. We prohibit actions and behavior that support a company’s monopoly or unreasonably restrains competition.
Corruption
does not pay bribes or conduct facilitating payments anywhere at any time. Doing so is in direct conflict with UTC’s commitment to fair competition.
Data Privacy
is committed to protecting the personal information of its customers, employees, contractors and business partners.
Government Contracts
With nearly 20 percent of UTC’s overall sales supporting the Department of Defense, the government is UTC’s largest customer. As such, focuses on competing fairly, delivering quality products and services, adhering to government accounting and pricing requirements, and the timely and accurate submission of data to the government.
International Trade Compliance (ITC)
As a leading importer and supplier of controlled products and to the Department of Defense, other national defense establishments and various domestic and international customers, is committed to conducting business in full compliance with all and other national laws and regulations governing exports, imports, anti-boycott, economic sanctions and embargoes.
