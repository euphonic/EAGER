Formulation Technology
"Formulation Technology" refers to the accurate, efficient, and prompt development of the optimal combination of materials from amongst countless prospective candidates (e.g. synthetic resins, fillers, etc.) in order to achieve the various characteristics and performance required by products.
Mixing and Dispersion Technology
"Mixing and Dispersion Technology" refers to the manufacture of uniformly-dispersed and precisely-balanced formulations. In recent years, in conjunction with the ever-decreasing size of electronics, finer dispersions have become increasingly more critical and required.
Group Main Proprietary Fundamental Technology
Leveraging its photolithography and insulation technology, Group has built its foundations on solder resist and other printed wiring board materials. 
Through the use of our photolithography technology, and adaptation of our conductive technology, Group is developing the area of flat panel display materials as our secondary product group. 
We intend to develop new product groups, such as the electronic and optical component groups, by further expanding our fundamental technologies including adhesive and thermal management technologies.
