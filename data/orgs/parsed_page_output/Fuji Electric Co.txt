 will actively invest in the strengthening of its power electronics systems business and the expansion of its power semiconductors businesses as it seeks to complete the current medium-term management plan and prepare for future growth.

To Our Shareholders and Investors
is moving ahead with the FY2018 Medium-Term Management Plan, Renovation 2018, which covers the three-year period ending with fiscal 2018. Acting in accordance with the plan’s basic policy of “further renovation of Electric,” we are implementing the growth strategies and pursuing improved profitability. 
In fiscal 2017, the second year of this three-year plan, consolidated net sales increased ¥55.7 billion year on year, to ¥893.5 billion, and operating income rose ¥11.3 billion year on year, to ¥56.0 billion, making for an operating margin of 6.3%. In this manner, operating income and the operating margin reached new record highs, achieving the targets of the medium-term management plan target a year ahead of schedule. 
In consideration of these performance trends, we decided to issue a year-end dividend of ¥8 per share, which, combined with the interim dividend, will make for a total of ¥14 per share for fiscal 2017, an increase of ¥3 per share over the previous fiscal year.
Turning eyes to the international society, we will see a movement to realize a sustainable society by achieving economic growth while also addressing social issues pertaining to energy, the environment, human rights, and other areas. This movement is exemplified by the adoption of the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Electric’s corporate philosophy and management policies emphasize its commitment to contributing to the creation of a sustainable society through its energy and environment businesses. In other words, our core principles are congruent with the contemporary needs of society and customers. 
Looking to the future, will advance a concerted effort to enhance its manufacturing capabilities and reenergize the Companywide Pro-7 Activities aimed at improved work quality. Our goal in these efforts will be to earn greater trust from stakeholders and continue the global provision of products customers trust.
In addition to these efforts, fiscal 2018 will also see use actively investing in the strengthening of our power electronics systems business and the expansion of our power semiconductors businesses as we seek to complete the current medium-term management plan. At the same time, we will begin formulating a new, five-year medium-term management plan set to end with fiscal 2023, when will celebrate the 100th anniversary of its founding. 
stands committed contributing to the realization of a responsible and sustainable society through its business in order to address the energy and environmental issues that threaten the earth.

FE’s First Shipment of Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems for Ships
  Co., Ltd. (headquartered in Tokyo, Japan; led by President Michihiro Kitazawa) is pleased to announce that today marked the first shipment of Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (EGCS) for ships from its Chiba Factory.
1． Background
   In the aim of reducing emissions of sulfur oxide (SOx), a substance responsible for air pollution, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set an upper limit of 0.5% on the sulfur content of ship fuel oil in most sea areas※1 to be achieved by 2020 (current limit: 3.5%). This regulation will apply to all ships, existing and newly constructed ones. Once this regulation is strengthened, shipowners will have to address this by means such as switching to fuels with lower sulfur content or using SOx scrubbers. has developed that is outfitted with a SOx scrubber that mixes exhaust gas with seawater and reduces the sulfur content of the gas. Today, the first shipment of this SOx scrubber left our Chiba Factory.
※1  Excluding the seas of North America and the Caribbean, the North Sea ,the Baltic Sea, and others. Regulated at 0.1% from 2015.
SOx scrubber (Chiba Factory)
2． Product Features
   Our combines a SOx scrubber with a gas analyzer, which measures the concentration of substances in exhaust gas in real time, as well as inverters and controllers that control a feed water pump that takes in sea water. It boasts a SOx removal efficiency of over 98%, and can also be used in the sea areas regulated with a 0.1% sulfur limit.
・ Achieved the world’s smallest SOx scrubber thanks to our proprietary technologies
   SOx scrubbers made by are the first in the world to use cyclone technology in their internal structure. This technology can efficiently bring the seawater (or alkaline chemicals) and exhaust gas into contact by generating a vortex in the exhaust gas and spraying seawater from the pipes arranged spirally (as shown in the lower right figure). This is how we achieved the world’s smallest※2 SOx scrubber. It can be easily applied to existing ships with limited installation space, and the loss of loading space by mounting the system can also be reduced.
    We hold patents for the pipe structure (branch pipe spiral structure) and spray nozzle distribution.
・Can be used in any sea area
   FE’s SOx scrubbers are available in both open loop and hybrid types. The open loop type is a system with a low investment burden, requiring few accessories, that uses seawater once and discharges it outside of the ship. The hybrid type combines open loop and closed loop technology (a method that uses circulating seawater with alkaline chemicals mixed in) so that ships can switch over in compliance with the regulations of the sea area in which they are operating. This makes it possible for the ship to operate anywhere, including sea areas where drainage is prohibited.※3
※3  German rivers and ports, the three-mile Belgian coast and bays, and waters of the states of California, Connecticut, and Hawaii
・Keeps operation costs down
  With this system installed, it is possible to continue to use current fuels (heavy fuel oil) instead of switching to low-sulfur fuels, thereby contributing to operation cost reduction for shipowners. We calculate that this system will yield a return on investment within about three years.※4
※4 Calculated based on fuel consumption amounts for a 95,000 deadweight tonnage equivalent bulker using fuel prices as of September 2018.
