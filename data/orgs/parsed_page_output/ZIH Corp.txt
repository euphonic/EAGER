Restaurant and Hotel Inventory Management
Increase Staff Effectiveness
Tracking of inventory and assets within a hotel or restaurant, whether they're supplies received into the holding area, carts for catering or tracing guests’ luggage, is fundamental to the success of any hospitality operation. Improper tracking or labeling of the goods and services can cause loss in revenue and an unpleasant guest experience. With Zebra’s inventory management solutions, manual tracking is a thing of the past. Handheld mobile computers, radio-frequency identification (RFID), and scanning let your staff quickly capture barcodes so every asset is visible at every turn in your operation – enabling you to address guests needs efficiently.
Automate Inventory Tracking
Ensure you meet your guests needs and maintain your property by knowing where your goods and services are located anytime, anywhere.
Enhanced Catering and Room Service
Provide a seamless experience for guests whether they are at a meeting, event or ordering services to their room by empowering your staff.
Food and Beverage
Empower your food service workforce by using mobile technology to automate weekly unit counts of ingredients and eliminate paper checklists.
Baggage Tracking
Reduce baggage check-in, storage and retrieval time and improve guest satisfaction with increased operational visibility.

Privacy Statement
STATEMENT
This Zebra Privacy Statement ("Privacy Statement") describes how Zebra Technologies Corporation and its subsidiaries and affiliates ("Zebra") collect, use, transfer, and disclose data including personally identifiable information (“Personal Information”) obtained through Zebra’s websites (the "Site(s)") and via other methods.  By using the Sites or submitting any Personal Information to Zebra, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Privacy Statement and the Zebra 
Terms of Use
.
This Privacy Statement also describes certain matters related to the EU-Privacy Shield and Swiss-Privacy Shield frameworks. Zebra has certified it adheres to EU-Privacy Shield framework and the Swiss-Privacy Shield framework.  To learn more and view Zebra’s Privacy Shield Policy 
click here
.
COLLECTS
Zebra collects data to provide customers with products and services, and to operate Zebra’s business. Some of this data is provided directly, such as when you create a Zebra account, connect a Zebra device to the Internet or a Cloud service, provide equipment for maintenance, or contact Zebra for support or to perform other services.  Zebra receives some data by recording how users interact with Zebra products and services by, for example, using technologies like Cookies, receiving error reports, usage data or location data from software running on Zebra products or from utilizing Zebra services.
The data Zebra collects depends on the products, services and features used, and can include the following:
Name and contact data
. Information, including Personal Information, collected through the Sites or through other means, may include name and salutation, job title, physical address, time zone, telephone number (including work or home office, mobile, and fax numbers), photograph, e-mail address, and other contact information. Zebra also collects marketing contacts and preferences (phone, email, postal mail, fax, and text messages), name and nature of your business, language preference, and delivery and fulfillment information.
Credentials
.
 Zebra collects information used for authentication and account access.
Payment data
. Zebra or its payment processor collects data necessary to process payments for purchases from Zebra, such as credit/debit card information, bank information, wire transfer and/or any other financial or payment information associated with a payment.
Usage data
. Zebra collects data about how users and devices interact with Zebra products and services. For example, Zebra collects:
Product use data
.
 Zebra collects product feature use data, website activity data, performance data, product preference information, purchase history, and the webpages you visit.
Device data
.
 Zebra may collect data about a device, its operational state, configuration, past usage data, device performance data, and information on the network used to connect and use Zebra products. This includes data about the operating systems, applications and other software installed on the device, including product keys. This also includes Internet Protocol (IP) address, network authentication, address, other device identifiers, regional and language settings.
Error reports and performance data
. Zebra collects data about the performance of Zebra products and problems experienced. This data helps diagnose problems in the products to improve Zebra’s products, and to provide solutions. Depending on product and settings, error reports may include data such as the type or severity of the problem, details of the software or hardware related to an error, device status, usage data, contents of data or files that were processing when an error occurred, and data about other devices, networks, or software with which the device interacts.
Support data
. When Zebra is engaged for support, Zebra’s contact with any data or information stored on a device will be incidental in most instances.  Devices returned to Zebra for repair should be wiped of all data.  Zebra will collect data about any hardware, software, and other details related to the support incident for the purpose of tracking device performance and product improvement.
Location data
. Zebra may collect data about your location, which can be either precise or imprecise. Precise location data can be Global Position System (GPS) data, as well as data identifying nearby cell towers and Wi-Fi hotspots Zebra collects when location-based products or features are enabled. Imprecise location data includes, for example, a location derived from your address or other data that indicates the geolocation of an address with less precision including latitude, longitude, city, region, country or postal code.
Cookies
. Sites may collect certain kinds of data which could encompass Personal Information during your visit, including through the use of Cookies. Cookies are small text files sent from a site to the hard drive of a user's device to store bits of information related to that user or device. Cookies can store information about the device and users, including addresses, navigational data, server information, data transfer times, user preferences, and passwords needed to access the special areas on Zebra Sites. Zebra uses Cookies to assist with the downloading of documents from Sites and for other business purposes such as traffic analysis of Sites. If you choose to create a user profile, Zebra will use Cookies to store the Personal Information for your profile. Your browser may be able to be configured to block, reject, remove or disable Cookies and other tracking technologies. However, if you reject or remove Cookies or other tracking technology, you might not be able to access certain pages or use important functions on Sites, including downloading documents and establishing a user profile.
Other Technology
.
 Sites also use addresses, log files and other technology to identify Site problems and usage. Zebra also uses Web beacons to perform standard traffic analysis on the Sites in a manner similar to how Zebra uses Cookies and to track Site(s) usage for statistical purposes. Zebra reserves the right to introduce new tracking technologies and techniques related to the use of the Sites, although Zebra will do so subject to and in accordance with applicable data protection laws and regulations.
INFORMATION
Zebra uses, discloses, transfers, and otherwise processes data, including Personal Information, in several ways. Zebra uses the data it collects for three basic purposes: (1) to process transactions for the sale and support of Zebra products and/or services, (2) to operate Zebra’s business, and to provide and support the products and services Zebra offers (including improving and personalizing), and (3) to send certain communications, including promotional communications. When customers place an order, Zebra uses the Personal Information provided, including any payment information necessary to provide the products or services requested.  If you create a user profile, Zebra will store Personal Information as requested to manage the profile and communicate with the user.
Without limiting our obligations under our 
Privacy Shield Policy
, if you are located outside of the United States, please be aware that any information you provide to Zebra through the Sites may be transferred to the United States.  Please also be aware that by using the Sites and giving Zebra your information, you consent to such transfer. You also understand that the may not provide the same level of protections as the laws of your country.
Personal Information may also, subject to the requirements of applicable law, be used, disclosed and transferred to law enforcement personnel and other persons in situations where Zebra believes that it is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal proceedings against someone who may be misusing the Sites, interfering with the rights of Zebra or other users, or when Zebra reasonably believes that the law requires or permits such disclosure.
INFORMATION
Zebra shares Personal Information with consent or as necessary to complete any transaction or provide any product or service requested or authorized. Zebra also may disclose and transfer Personal Information to channel partners, strategic partners, suppliers and other third parties for the purposes described in this Privacy Statement and to assist with the operation of the Sites and/or the associated business transactions.  If Zebra sells or divests all or part of its business, makes a transfer of assets, or otherwise becomes involved in a change of control transaction, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy, Zebra may transfer Personal Data covered by this Privacy Shield Policy to one or more third parties as part of the transaction including the due diligence process.
Additionally, Zebra will access, transfer, disclose, and preserve Personal Information when Zebra has a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to:
comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal process, including from law enforcement or other government agencies;
protect our customers, for example to prevent unsolicited emails or attempts to defraud users of Zebra products, or to help prevent the loss of life or serious injury of anyone;
operate and maintain the security of Zebra’s products and services, including to prevent or stop an attack on Zebra’s computer systems or networks; or
protect the rights or property of Zebra, including enforcing the terms governing the use of the products or services; however, if Zebra receives information indicating that someone is using Zebra products or services to traffic in stolen intellectual or physical property, Zebra may refer the matter to law enforcement.
SECURITY
Pursuant to applicable regulations, Zebra maintains reasonable technical and administrative procedures to protect data including Personal Information against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, but Zebra cannot ensure or warrant the security of any data against any possible loss or unauthorized access.
INFORMATION
If you wish to access or update the Personal Information submitted through the Sites, or to make any inquiries (including requests of cancellation or deletion) about the collection or processing of such information, please contact us as described below in the section labeled "Contact" or in the 
Privacy Shield Policy
 as applicable.  Zebra provides individuals with access to their Personal Information where required by applicable data protection and privacy laws.  Individuals will be required to sufficiently verify their identity.

If you link to or otherwise visit any other sites managed by third parties, you must review the privacy policies posted at those sites.  Zebra has no control over those sites and is not responsible or liable for the policies and practices followed by third parties.
DATA
Zebra will keep your data, which may include Personal Information, for as long as necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, to provide you with products or services, to conduct legitimate business interests, and where otherwise required or permitted by law.

Selecting the Right Channel Partner
We've carefully constructed our channel partner network to serve a broad array of customers. The companies we choose to collaborate with bring value to our mutual customers through distinct offerings and experience in many different technologies and markets. 
company's relationship with Zebra Technologies is defined by four factors: 
community, track, tier
 and 
specialization
. Our different Partner types are currently arranged in three communities: Distributor, Reseller and Complementary Partner. Within the Reseller and Complementary Partner communities, we have further defined tracks of partners that allow differentiation based on the unique value they provide to you. Within the Reseller track you will find our Specialists that are recognized for their product focus, expertise, and service delivery capabilities with respect to Card Printers, Print Engines, RFID, Supplies and Wireless Networks.

Community and Track

Zebra categorizes partners based on their business model. Depending on the product and the complexity of your technology needs, you can purchase Zebra products from:
Distributors – 
Our authorized Distributors enable Zebra’s broader channel ecosystem and play an essential role in providing a wide range of value, depending on the geography and market they serve. Distributors identify new go-to-market approaches and can help to reach, influence and engage to drive sales. They also provide expanded value-added support such as demand creation, training, order fulfillment, financing and bringing our technologies to market by selling Zebra products to Resellers. Distributors also support the configuration and integration of complete multi-vendor solutions. 
Zebra is committed to selling through our Distributors whenever possible. 
Resellers – 
Composed of a wide variety of business types that accommodate the multiple ways that you do business, these channel partners sell from the entire portfolio of Zebra Technologies products and services, and include the following four Tracks:
• 
Business Partners:
 the members in this segment of our Reseller community typically provide expertise in our core technologies
•

• 
Registered Resellers:

Tiers
PartnerConnect recognize a partner’s success in building its relationship with Zebra by building separate ranks—called Tiers—into the structure of a Partner Track.
As a differentiator, 
Resellers 
in the 
Business Partner Track
 and 
Solution Partner Track
 can be recognized for growth, market penetration and development of key capabilities by achieving higher Tiers.
Resellers
in the 
Business Partner Track

Premier Business Partners – 
these partners meet your demands for leading-edge enterprise solutions through their multi-layered expertise in various areas and with a broader reach—and deeper influence and engagement—in the marketplace.
Resellers in the 
Solution Partner Track
 also fall into two tiers:
Solution Partners – 
these partners serve customers by studying and evaluating your infrastructure and needs, specifying the requisite mix of our hardware and software for your solution and tending to its installation at your site, and providing essential services. 
Premier Solution Partners - 
these partners meet Zebra’s highest standard for professional certification and comprehensively handle your requirements from conception to installation, often including ongoing service and support in the enterprise solution that is fashioned to your specific needs. These fellow visionaries collaborate with Zebra as we usher in the future of the enterprise.
Complimentary Partners
 on the Track can also be recognized with additional benefits by achieving higher tiers. 
Partners in the 
Track
 fall into three tiers: 
• 
Registered ISV

• 
Partner

• 
Premier Partner

Specializations
Specialists 
are companies that have demonstrated a significant level of competency and success in a particular technology. 
These companies demonstrate exceptional experience in addressing customer needs and have invested in building highly competent teams. In fact, to become a Specialist, channel partners must meet our rigorous criteria. All of our Resellers can become Specialists.

Zebra Technologies Completes Acquisition of Xplore Technologies
LINCOLNSHIRE, Ill. 
– 
Aug. 14, 2018
 – 
Zebra Technologies Corporation
 (NASDAQ: ZBRA), an innovator at the edge of the enterprise with solutions and partners that enable businesses to gain a performance edge, today announced that it has completed its 
acquisition
 of Xplore Technologies Corporation, a leading developer of semi-, fully- and ultra-rugged tablets, 2-in-1 laptops, and a range of performance matched accessories. Xplore’s offerings complement Zebra’s industry-leading enterprise mobile computing, data capture, and printing portfolios, which will now serve a wider range of enterprise customers and accelerate growth.
The tender offer for all outstanding shares of common stock of Xplore at a price of $6.00 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest and less any required tax withholding (the "Offer"), expired as scheduled at 12:00 midnight eastern time at the end of the day on Monday, August 13, 2018. American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, the depositary for the Offer, has advised Zebra that 9,923,943 shares of Xplore common stock were validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in the Offer, representing approximately 73.1 percent of the outstanding shares of Xplore’s common stock on a fully diluted basis (including all shares underlying Xplore’s outstanding restricted stock units and stock options). All conditions to the Offer have been satisfied and on August 14, 2018, Zebra and its wholly owned subsidiary, Wolfdancer Acquisition (“Purchaser”) accepted for payment and will promptly pay for all shares validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in the Offer.
Following completion of the Offer, Zebra completed the acquisition of Xplore through the merger of Purchaser with and into Xplore, without a vote of Xplore’s stockholders pursuant to Section 251(h) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, with Xplore surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Zebra. In connection with the merger, each share of common stock outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger (other than (1) shares owned by Xplore as treasury stock immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, (2) shares owned by Zebra or Purchaser at the commencement of the Offer and owned by Zebra or Purchaser immediately prior to the effective time of the merger or (3) shares held by any stockholder who has properly demanded and not otherwise lost appraisal rights under Delaware law) has been converted into the right to receive the same $6.00 per share in cash, without interest and less applicable tax withholding, as will be paid for all shares that were validly tendered and not properly withdrawn in the Offer. Xplore’s common stock will be delisted from the Nasdaq Capital Market.
Safe Harbor Statement
This press release contains forward-looking statements, as defined by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, the statements regarding the company’s outlook. Actual results may differ from those expressed or implied in the company’s forward-looking statements. These statements represent estimates only as of the date they were made. Zebra undertakes no obligation, other than as may be required by law, to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, changed circumstances or any other reason after the date of this release.
These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, forecasts and assumptions and are subject to the risks and uncertainties inherent in Zebra’s industry, market conditions, general domestic and international economic conditions, and other factors. These factors include customer acceptance of Zebra’s hardware and software products and competitors’ product offerings, and the potential effects of technological changes. The continued uncertainty over future global economic and trade conditions, the availability of credit and capital markets volatility may have adverse effects on Zebra, its suppliers and its customers. In addition, a disruption in our ability to obtain products from vendors as a result of supply chain constraints, natural disasters or other circumstances could restrict sales and negatively affect customer relationships. Profits and profitability will be affected by Zebra’s ability to control manufacturing and operating costs. Because of its debt, interest rates and financial market conditions will also have an impact on results. Foreign exchange rates will have an effect on financial results because of the large percentage of our international sales. The outcome of litigation in which Zebra may be involved is another factor. The success of integrating acquisitions could also affect profitability, reported results and the company’s competitive position in its industry. These and other factors could have an adverse effect on Zebra’s sales, gross profit margins and results of operations and increase the volatility of our financial results. When used in this release and documents referenced, the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “outlook,” and “expect” and similar expressions, as they relate to the company or its management, are intended to identify such forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying these statements. Descriptions of the risks, uncertainties and other factors that could affect the company’s future operations and results can be found in Zebra’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company’s most recent Form 10-K.
