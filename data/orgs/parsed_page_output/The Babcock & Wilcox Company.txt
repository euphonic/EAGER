Transforming Our World For 150 Years
year 2017 marked 150th anniversary of Wilcox, that began in 1867 with one patent, two friends and an unwavering commitment to reliable and effective innovation. When Stephen first avowed that “there must be a better way” to safely generate power, he and George responded with design for first inherently safe water-tube boiler, and was born. This challenge to continuously improve endures today.
We are a built and sustained by employees with curious minds and persevering wills. We work hard to earn trust of our customers and deliver value with highest level of ethics and integrity. generations of employees who continue legacy — who realize they are part of something Big Wonderful — are reason we celebrate this incredible sesquicentennial milestone.
We have grown across industries and continents. We have diversified in tools we use and technologies we supply. One thing that has not and will never change is our commitment to engineering a better way. This is how we are Transforming Our World.

Learn More About Our History
Thomas Edison, who had B&boilers in his laboratory, writes that a B&boiler is “best boiler God has permitted man yet to make.”
In 1878 Thomas Edison purchased B&boiler No. 92 for his Menlo Park laboratory.

Large-Scale Utility Power     
Shortly after our establishment in 1867, designed world's first installed utility boiler. B&boilers now provide more than 300,000 of generating capacity in approximately 60 countries.  
In 1957 when B&built world's first commercially operated  supercritical boiler , our designs were instrumental in advancement of power generation efficiency.  Since then, we've designed and constructed first ultra-supercritical power plant using technology representing most advanced steam cycle conditions commercially available today.   
Supercritical
Designed for pulverized coal, B&W's advanced once-through ultra-supercritical boilers are usually applied to systems with a capacity of 400 or more.  These clean and efficient boilers usually operate at throttle pressures of 3500 psi (24.1 MPa) or more and steam temperatures in 1100(595C) range.
B&W's radiant boiler designs accommodate pulverized coal, including difficult-to-burn coals, natural gas and/or oil and combustible byproduct gases. Subcritical pressures range usually 1800 to 2600 psi (12.4 to 17.9 MPa) and superheater and reheater outlet temperatures as required, usually in range of 1000 to 1050 (538 to 566C).
Circulating Fluidized-Bed
With subcritical and supercritical steam pressures, temperatures and capacities, our top-supported, one- or two-drum designs use challenging fuels in a circulating bed of inert particles to control combustion and emissions. boiler is ideal for high sulfur and high ash fuels and various waste fuels, wood, biomass, gob and culm.     
When we developed our first waste-to-energy plant in 1930, it revolutionized waste disposal techniques.
Over years,  B& and Vølund  waste-to-energy,  biomass  and  multi-fuel  technologies have been incorporated in more than 500 production lines in more than 30 countries. 
Waste-to-Energy
B&integrates steam generation systems for both mass burning of  and utilizing refuse-derived fuel.  maximum recovery of resources is a top priority in both designs. Our flexible boiler designs accommodate various capacities, fuel compositions and steam requirements and advanced combustion technologies destroy dioxins and furans, minimize formation of NOx and CO, and minimize unburned carbon.
Biomass Multi-Fuel
From biomass combustion to gasification, B&and B&Vølund offer solutions for a wide spectrum of biomass fuels, including: wood chips, pellets, saw dust, wheat straw, barley, rice straw, bark and biogas. Biomass is CO2 neutral, which significantly reduces environmental impact. And our multi-fuel technology is result of decades of experience with various renewable energy fuels. 
Bubbling-Fluidized Bed
boilers are ideal for a wide range of biomass and high-moisture waste fuels. B&W’s bubbling fluidized-bed (BFB) top- or bottom-supported, one- or two-drum designs prove attractive in new or retrofit applications. Capacities for bottom-supported range up to 225,000 lb/h (28.4 kg/s) and top-supported from 225,000 to 1,000,000 lb/h (28.4 to 126 kg/s).       
Industrial Boilers
We are a global leader in supplying a wide range of industrial water-tube boiler designs to meet targeted, challenging, long-lasting operational and performance goals for power and process applications.
Our  industrial water-tube package boilers , Stirling® and Towerpak® power boilers, and  fluidized-bed boilers  are custom engineered to each project’s unique specifications for varying inputs and desired outputs.
Pulp Paper | Recovery   
B&W's chemical and heat recovery boilers for pulp and paper industry range from a pulp mill liquor processing capacity to 10,000,000 lb/day (4500 t/day) dry solids at steam pressures up to 1850 psi (12.6 MPa) with design and to 2600 psi (17.9 MPa) with reheat design.
Water-Tube Package Industrial Boilers
With more than 5000 units and 150 years of experience, our water-tube package and industrial boilers have an established reputation for reliability and proven performance in a wide range of industries and applications. We offer shop-assembled or modularized bottom-supported designs for oil, natural gas and other gaseous and liquid fuels. Capacities range from 10,000 to 1,200,000 lb/h (4.5 to 544.2 t/h), depending on type and design features.
Bubbling-Fluidized Bed     
B&W’s bubbling fluidized-bed (BFB) top- or bottom-supported, one- or two-drum designs prove attractive in new or retrofit applications. Capacities for bottom-supported range up to 225,000 lb/h (28.4 kg/s) and top-supported from 225,000 to 1,000,000 lb/h (28.4 to 126 kg/s). boilers are ideal for a wide range of biomass and high-moisture waste fuels.
Our circulating fluidized-bed (CFB) boiler features a top-supported, one- or two-drum design ideal for burning challenging fuels, including high sulfur and high ash fuels and various waste fuels, wood, biomass, gob and culm. Capacity, steam pressure and temperature ranges with subcritical and supercritical applications.
Solid Multi-Fuel Boilers Stirling®
B&W’s Stirling® boiler has provided dependable steam to industry for more than 100 years. proven and flexible design has made Stirling power boiler adaptable for applications in a variety of industries using a wide range of fuels
Solid Multi-Fuel Boilers Towerpak®
B&W’s Towerpak® boiler is a version of our Stirling® power boiler designed for lower capacities. It incorporates many of design and manufacturing technology features of Stirling boiler, including furnace construction details, convection surface design and circulation enhancements. versatility of Towerpak boiler to burn virtually any fuel, alone or in combination, is especially useful for industrial applications.

Clever Technologies for Bottom Ash Management
B&W’s unique and patented Allen-Sherman-Hoff
®
Submerged Grind Conveyor
 (SGC) system is a cost-effective solution to high operation and maintenance costs for existing bottom ash systems. system uses existing infrastructure to help plants upgrade faster with minimal impact to operations, and will also help support future Coal Combustion Residual (CCR) management rules and Effluent Limitations Guidelines (ELG).
Read Burns McDonnell’s evaluation of regulations and available options for compliance
.
A simplified and cost-effective system that meets zero-discharge bottom ash removal requirements with consideration to each unique plant layout.
Every aspect of our 
SGC
’s design took into account impact of a retrofit from its initial installation through its ongoing operation. Because our is small and compact — and doesn’t require removal or displacement of bottom ash hoppers or slag tanks, ash gates, clinker grinders, transfer enclosures and other existing equipment — installation can be accelerated to save time at a lower cost than other bottom ash conveyance systems. In addition, simpler, mechanical transfer conveyor design has low auxiliary power requirements and low maintenance costs. All of these benefits come with high performance, predictable results and trusted reliability you have come to expect from B&and Allen-Sherman-Hoff line of material handling solutions.
To ease maintenance over time and use of conveyor, existing ash gate was designed to isolate conveyor from ash hopper. boiler can stay online since ash can be stored in existing ash hopper, and conveyors are equipped with variable speed drives to make up for any resulting slowdown.
