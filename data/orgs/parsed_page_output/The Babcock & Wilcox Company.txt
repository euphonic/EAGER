Transforming Our World For 150 Years
year 2017 marked 150th anniversary of Wilcox, that began in 1867 with one patent, two friends and an unwavering commitment to reliable and effective innovation. When Stephen first avowed that “there must be a better way” to safely generate power, he and George responded with design for first inherently safe water-tube boiler, and was born. This challenge to continuously improve endures today.
We are a built and sustained by employees with curious minds and persevering wills. We work hard to earn trust of our customers and deliver value with highest level of ethics and integrity. generations of employees who continue legacy — who realize they are part of something Big Wonderful — are reason we celebrate this incredible sesquicentennial milestone.
We have grown across industries and continents. We have diversified in tools we use and technologies we supply. One thing that has not and will never change is our commitment to engineering a better way. This is how we are Transforming Our World.
