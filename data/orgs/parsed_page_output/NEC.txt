Profit structure reform status under the Mid-term Management Plan 2020
Share
Tokyo, November 29, 2018 - Aiming to implement continued investments in order to get back on the track to growth under the Mid-term Management Plan 2020, (NEC; TSE: 6701) is introducing significant reforms to its profit structure.
As part of these efforts, is announcing the results of human resource measures, including a career transition support measure that promotes voluntary retirement within the Group, and the transfer of its lighting business. These measures will allow to streamline its workforce by approximately 3,000 personnel, and are expected to improve earnings by approximately 24.0 billion yen on an annualized basis.
1．Human resource measure results
(1) Career transition support measure
Overview
(1) Eligible employees:Employees of and Group companies belonging to back-office departments and particular departments under the hardware business segment who are 45 years old or older and have worked for the company for at least five years
(2) Target number of applicants:Unspecified
(3) Application period:October 29 to November 9, 2018
(4) Retirement date:December 28, 2018
(5) Support to be provided:In addition to the regular retirement allowance, an additional "career transition support allowance" will also be provided, along with access to reemployment support services through a reemployment support agency
*Different conditions apply for some Group companies
*International subsidiaries and some Group companies are excluded from this measure
Results
Future outlook
The cost of implementing this measure will be approximately 20.0 billion yen, recorded as business structure improvement expenses for the third quarter of the fiscal year ending March 2019 (nine months ending December 2018). This cost has already been taken into account for the consolidated financial forecast for the fiscal year ending March 2019.
(2) Other measures
In addition to the "career transition support measure," plans to further reduce its workforce by approximately 400 personnel by the end of March 2019 through temporary and permanent transfers to companies outside the Group, including subcontractors and client companies.
2．Transfer of lighting business
has also decided to transfer all businesses of Lighting, Ltd., which handles NEC's lighting business, through a company split to a newly formed company under the investment fund that receives advice from Nippon Mirai Capital Co., Ltd. The transfer is scheduled to take place on April 1, 2019. As a result of the transfer, will receive 5% of the shares of the new company.
Beginning with the mass production of fluorescent lamps in 1952, for more than 60 years, has provided a safe, secure, and comfortable living environment to its customers through lighting. Following the rapid shift in demand to lighting, which has a simpler manufacturing process compared to fluorescent lights, competition in the lighting market has continued to further intensify. In recent years, has been focusing on Solutions for Society designed to bring about the sophistication of social infrastructure through In this connection, the company has come to the decision to aim for medium- to long-term business growth by carrying out reforms in profit structure through flexible business management in regard to NEC's lighting business under Nippon Mirai Capital Co., Ltd., a management company for domestic and independent investment funds, which possesses extensive experience in the formulation of growth strategies for companies being invested in and the provision of support for their execution, as well as support for the creation of organizational structure for the subsidiaries of large companies that are becoming independent.
Along with continuing to pursue reforms in its profit structure, will accelerate initiatives aimed at achieving growth, such as the expansion of its global business centering on safety business as the engine for growth, the shift to a service-oriented business model in its domestic business within Japan, and the creation of business infrastructure for enhancing its execution capabilities.
