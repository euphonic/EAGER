Company Overview
As the world leader in carbon nanotube electronics, has developed a new generation of memory called NRAM® (non-volatile random access memory). This new super-fast, ultra-high density memory replaces both and flash in a single chip, while also delivering the low power, high speed, reliability, and endurance needed to drive the next wave of electronics innovation.
Installed in multiple production fabs around the globe and able to scale below 5 nanometers over time, is currently being designed into exciting new products that will redefine what is possible in the world of electronics.
The Future of Memory
Targeting a wide range of markets, memory is as fast as DRAM, non-volatile like flash, and can be used in standard fabs with existing tools. This will enable manufacturers to quickly and cost-effectively migrate to a new generation of memory, which has become a critical requirement as flash and technology near their end of life.
Comprehensive Portfolio
At the heart of Nantero’s is its unique use of carbon nanotube technology , which is considered to be one of the strongest materials known to man. As a pioneer in nanotechnology, has amassed one of the most comprehensive portfolios with over 170 patents issued to date and more than 200 patents pending. This includes the world’s only family of patents for the material and methods to successfully bring carbon nanotubes into an existing fabrication facility.
Business Model
Nantero’s business model is based on licensing its to major chip manufacturers, foundries, and electronics companies around the world. The company supports its customers in offering as both embedded and standalone memory and is already working with over a dozen major corporations in partnership.

Under his leadership, rose to become a semiconductor technology leader with its R&organization growing from 148 to 4,000 people, while annual R&spending rising from $80 million to $1.6 billion.
Dr. Chiang earned his Bachelor of Science degree from National Taiwan University in 1968, his Master of Science degree from Princeton University in 1970, and his Doctorate from Stanford University in 1974, all in electrical engineering. After completing his studies, he worked at Corporation, Texas Instruments and Hewlett-Packard. In 2001, he was chosen as one of 50 “Stars of Asia” by Businessweek Magazine, together with then Japanese Prime Minister Mr. Junichiro Koizumi and the mayor of Seoul Mr. Lee Myung-bak. Dr. Chiang is also a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
“Nantero’s next generation memory has the potential to be a game-changer in both standalone and embedded memory,” said Dr. Chiang. “am pleased to work with the experienced and ambitious team has put together as they embark on their next phase of growth and industry leadership.”
About Lee Cleveland
As Nantero’s new of Design, Lee Cleveland has already recruited a world-class design team with experience in both high-density and flash design. This team is currently working on exciting new
product designs, including multi-gigabyte high speed DDR4-compatible nonvolatile standalone memories. Before joining Nantero, Lee was in charge of flash design at and Spansion, where he was responsible for multiple generations of shipping memory products. He has also served as of Engineering at Sipex and Exar, as well as of Engineering and at Kilopass. Lee holds a degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of California, Berkeley.
