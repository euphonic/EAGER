Company Overview
Company Overview
As the world leader in carbon nanotube electronics, has developed a new generation of memory called NRAM® (non-volatile random access memory). This new super-fast, ultra-high density memory replaces both and flash in a single chip, while also delivering the low power, high speed, reliability, and endurance needed to drive the next wave of electronics innovation.
Installed in multiple production fabs around the globe and able to scale below 5 nanometers over time, is currently being designed into exciting new products that will redefine what is possible in the world of electronics.
The Future of Memory
Targeting a wide range of markets, memory is as fast as DRAM, non-volatile like flash, and can be used in standard fabs with existing tools. This will enable manufacturers to quickly and cost-effectively migrate to a new generation of memory, which has become a critical requirement as flash and technology near their end of life.
Comprehensive Portfolio
At the heart of Nantero’s is its unique use of carbon nanotube technology , which is considered to be one of the strongest materials known to man. As a pioneer in nanotechnology, has amassed one of the most comprehensive portfolios with over 170 patents issued to date and more than 200 patents pending. This includes the world’s only family of patents for the material and methods to successfully bring carbon nanotubes into an existing fabrication facility.
