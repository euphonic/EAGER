History
Sony put the Japan's first transistor radio TR-55 on the market in 1955, which achieved significant downsizing with the use of transistors in place of existing vacuum tubes. The company also succeeded in developing a copper foil with adhesive for printed circuit board (PCB) for transistor radios jointly with Rubber and Asbestos Inc. in the United States (hereafter referred to as R&A). The company imported this copper foil manufactured by R&and subcontracted the processing to a domestic maker. However, in anticipation of the growing demand for transistor radios, the company signed a technical assistance contract with R&(later acquired by Pittsburgh Plate Glass Co.) to encourage domestic production. Then as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sony for manufacturing and sales of copper foil products for circuits and industrial adhesive products, Sony Chemicals was founded.
Sony Chemicals started production of Z782, a liquid adhesive for polyvinyl chloride (PVC) steel sheets with the opening of Haneda Plant. The company released Bondmaster "Tuff" for general-purpose adhesive for home use followed by a series of products including "Clear," "Epoxy" and "Vinyl." For industrial adhesives, as the certification of (Underwriters Laboratory) became mandatory for fixing of electronic parts in electrical appliances, chloroprene-rubber base flame retardant adhesive SC12went on sale for fixing of electronic parts, so the company expanded the business in both domains, industrial use and home use. The next year the company also pushed into the industry of sealing materials for building materials.
Production of the long-awaited copper foil with adhesive made in Japan started.
Sony Chemicals also moved into the double coated tapes industry. Following the introduction of home-use "Tuck Master," the industrial-use "Tuck Master" was also launched in 1967. Particularly the model #1477introduced on the market in 1968 earned an excellent reputation, so it evolved into the later T4000 Series, which won a position as a standard option of high-performance double coated tapes.
Following the successful production of ferrite in monocrystalline form in 1964, Sony proceeded to manufacture tape recorder heads in response to the full-scale mass production of the home-use tape recorder Model TC-2850They also started full-blown mass production of ferrite cores for television, in response to the demand for the manufacturing of "Trinitron" color Model KV-1310.
Tokai Electronics established (Renamed Sony Atsuta in April 1990).
Started production of printed circuits for Sony’s Trinitron color (CRTs).
Sony Chemicals initiated the full-scale production of flexible printed circuit board (FPC) that contributed to the reduction in both size and weight of electronic devices. The following year the fine-pattern flexible printed circuit board for LCDs went on sale.
Later, as more home-use audio equipment, sets and video equipment came into widespread domestic use, electronic devices that utilized magnetic heads and ferrite cores in particular, were successively supplied for Sony brand products.
The reliable, high-precision fabrication and assembly techniques as well as the thin-film technology that was developed around that time served as a foundation for the current electronic products and optical devices of ultra-fine nano-micron scale modules.
As panels for digital cameras and cellular phones and also the flat panel displays become widespread, the demand for display devices is increasingly growing. Anisotropic Conductive Film (ACF) is indispensable for the evolution of display devices. This year Sony Chemicals succeeded in commercializing the before the rest of the industry.
Production of the TR4050 ink ribbon for thermal transfer printers used for printing of barcodes was started. Printing of barcodes especially used in merchandise logistic applications requires a higher level of clarity and durability, though the company has been meeting the stringent demands with proprietary engineering expertise, and the products have been used worldwide.
Sony Chemicals went public in order to lead the public to a better understanding and a higher recognition of the proprietary advanced technologies.
Tokai Electronics succeeded in developing the first consumer-use high-density thin multilayer printed circuit boards, which was designed to mount the 0.5 mm-pitch Quad Flat Package (QFP). It was incorporated in the passport-sized Handycam®, a hot-selling video camera, helping to downsize the camcorder.
company has been pushing ahead with the manufacturing and sales of ink ribbon for thermal transfer printers in Started production of reflective layer protective coating material for optical disks in 1998.
Started selling of adhesive tapes and adhesives for home and industrial use.
Sony Neagari was set up to expand the business of high-density multilayer printed wiring boards acting as one of the important key devices and to serve as the production base for onboard devices. Working in cooperation with the design team in Sony Corporation, Sony Neagari has been establishing a track record in circuit board wiring design and onboard device design.
Started production and selling of ink ribbon for thermal transfer printers.
To keep up with the transition of recording media from tape to disk, Sony Chemicals developed and started selling of its SK3200 Series recording layer protection coating material for optical disks. The manufacturing know-how at this time frame was of much help in developing the SK6000 Series bonding materials for lamination.
Started production of printed circuit board.
As notebook-size personal computers, cellular phones, video cameras and other portable electronic equipment were coming out with reduced sizes and advanced features, the Li-ion rechargeable battery market expanded. Then Sony Chemicals succeeded in the world first mass production of protection elements that are essential to the safe operation of Li-ion batteries. Further in 1998, the company successfully developed the world's smallest size protection element Self Control Protector for Li-ion rechargeable batteries.
The standards prescribe stringent requirements for activities to maintain conformity even after acquisition of certification. Sony Chemicals became the first to obtain ISO14001(Environmental Management System) certification. The same year the company acquired the certification of quality assurance standard ISO9001.
In response to the downsized design of Handycam®, Sony Neagari developed and put the build-up printed circuit board into production.
Sony Neagari started volume production of multilayer printed circuit board that was incorporated in the home-use hand-held video game console PlayStation® first produced by Sony Computer Entertainment. In 2000, a multilayer printed circuit board for the PlayStation®2 was designed and it was adopted also in the PlayStation®Portable (PSP) in 2005.
Sony Chemicals became a recipient of the first Listed Company Disclosure Award granted by Tokyo Stock Exchange to honor companies who actively disclose their corporate information. The company was highly regarded for the solid information disclosed and readable descriptions.
Started production and selling of flexible flat cable and flexible printed circuit board.
In order to quickly answer the needs for a thinner printed circuit board in response to the downsizing and enhanced performance of electronic equipment, the flexible electronic circuit board "2 layer polyimide circuit board" was developed. The board was released as a halogen-free product, which eliminated adhesive layer based on the proprietary joining technique and contained no halogen that could emit harmful substances when incinerated.
Sony Chemicals developed a wide range of eco-friendly products, including the halogen-free flexible flat cable (FFC), the solvent-less halogen-free double coated tapes G9000 which does not use any toluene, and other organic solvents in the manufacturing process, and the Anisotropic Conductive Film (ACF) for environmentally conscious high-reliability semiconductor packages and The company has been highly regarded for its environmental consciousness.
Due to the high recognition for element technologies concerning crystal formation, ultra-precision fabrication and thin-film deposition about ferrite and prism, the company started production of prisms for optical disks.
Based on know-how accumulated over the years of manufacturing and production engineering of various devices, the company successfully introduced the film-glass resistive touch screens in 2001. Encouraged by a good reputation for stronger glass due to the adoption of a super-cutting design, the company made a full-scale entry into the touch screen market space. The touch screen products have been finding applications in the fields of PDAs, smart phones, and PNDs by a number of providers because of their well-balanced quality and reliability.
In addition, equipped with the additionally developed high transparency and low reflection film, the touch screens are well received as easy-on-the-eye displays.
Sony Chemicals established the roll-to-roll sputtering system suited for volume production by applying the proprietary technology for Anti-reflection film for cylindrical CRTs, which had been developed by Sony Corporation.
As recording media shifted from analog to digital formats and optical modules were coming out with higher resolutions, the demand for semiconductor modules grew. Driven by this trend, the curable adhesive for optical pickup was developed and went on sale.
The Corporation's (Neo Manhattan Bump Interconnection) technology was adopted and the high-density mounting double-sided flex-rigid printed circuit board was developed, and started production.
As integrated circuits are coming out with advanced features, protection against elevated temperatures. The thermal conductive sheet was developed to efficiently dissipate heat from circuit boards even if mounted in closed enclosures.
The H-(High Speed transmission All layer via Thin PWB) lump-sum lamination Any Layer multilayer printed circuit board was developed, which could contribute to reduce both time-to-market and man-hours. It became possible to develop a lump-sum lamination circuit board using materials of low dielectric constant and low dielectric loss and to produce boards with excellent high-speed transmission features on short lead times.
Unification of "Sony Chemicals Corporation" and "Sony Miyagi Corporation" and Changed company name to "Sony Chemical & Information Device Corporation."
