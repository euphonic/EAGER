Within the "Philosophy" that we have held up as the company's ideal since our foundation, it states that  "We contribute to the advancement of society by ... creating innovative products and solutions..." 
That expresses our strong desire to contribute to more affluent, higher quality living for everyone through our products.
For example, communication devices like smartphones have become a part of the social infrastructure, and our company's product lineup has played a part in the miniaturization and higher performance capabilities of those phones. Wearable devices and the field of IoT/IoE, which are only expected to continue to grow, also present the potential to further change society in the future.
The fields in which electronics play an active part will expand significantly and is already contributing to a safer and more environmentally-friendly automotive sector. In the energy field as well, we are providing solutions to the problems of limited resources and to environmental issues, and we are supporting human health and improvements in quality of life in the healthcare and medical fields.
In addition to making a social contribution through our business, there is a need for us to deal with the many global issues that must be resolved in order to realize a sustainable society, including those related to the environment, human rights, etc. So, the electronics industry has, for example, been involved from early on towards solving the problem of mineral resources in regions of conflict, with earnestly tackling these issues in cooperation with our supply chain.
Furthermore, as a company that is expanding our business around the globe, we are also placing a focus on providing work environments that are appropriate for a diversity of people, without partiality to gender or nationality, etc. We respect a diversity of backgrounds and values, we globally share the "Philosophy" and the direction that we are aiming at while carrying out mutual exchange of personnel between bases both in and outside Japan, and we are implementing various measures toward offering the best value to society.
In 2015, the Japanese government introduced the Corporate Governance Code, wherein greater transparency is demanded in corporate management. Also based on the spirit of the company's Philosophy, is committed to building trust as we comply with all aspects of ethics in business, and we will continue to fulfill our social responsibility in cooperation with our stakeholders.
In promoting Management, our company has established a Management Committee on the basis of a Charter whose benchmark is that same  "Philosophy" . will continue to aim at  "being an open presence in our community and in society as a whole, and to remain a corporation that is worthy of trust and respect" so "that our customers know they are in good hands when they do business with Murata" .

Contribute to development of a future to be achieved by electronics, continuing to be a company needed by customers and society in any era
Changes in the society surrounding us
Digitization of every type of “object” and Murata’s expanding business opportunities
The appearance of electronics symbolizing the times – radios, color televisions, cameras, computers, mobile phones, and smartphones – has improved people’s quality of life. The history of has been with rooted in such progress in society. By supporting achievement of product functions to be required in each age, has contributed to society and continued to be needed by society. Now, in this age, every type of “object” in our surroundings is being digitized and is required to create new value by making use of its innovation.
Regarding smartphones which have driven the recent electronic parts market and rapid growth of Murata, volume growth has been moderate, but the number of functions increases, the number of electronic parts used per unit has drastically increased. Also, thanks to
increasing speed and functions of communication due to movements such as the introduction of 5G, this is an area where growth is expected as a pillar of our business in the future.
The automobile industry is also seeing changes which must not overlook. In Europe, China, India and other countries, entire nations are moving to shift theindustry from gasoline and diesel vehicles to electric vehicles (EVs). Due to an accelerated shift to EVs, some estimates suggest that in 2040, EVs will account for more than 50% of global new car sales. Furthermore, in parallel with the shift to EVs, development of autonomous vehicles is accelerating. Automation to maintain lanes and distance between cars on expressways as well as to follow the vehicle ahead during congestion has started to come into wide use as a part of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). Consequently, the number of sensors to be used for safe travel is increasing. In addition, high-speed wireless communication (V2X) associated with an increase of data traffic between cars and the outside world will be a requirement, alongside computer processing systems for large amounts of data inside a car in real-time. In terms of demand for parts over the medium term, it is said that with shifts to EVs and autonomous cars, the number of electronic parts used per vehicle will significantly increase compared to vehicles with internal-combustion engines.
In addition to further digitization of smartphones and cars, development of an Iosociety is a trend to be noted. Against a background of an expanding Iosociety where every type of object is connected via networks, an increasing number of devices will be connected to
networks. Moreover, considering the expanding demand for base stations and servers which process and store data collected from those devices and high-speed computers which are used for new value creation using AI, demand for electronic parts used for these items will also grow by an order of magnitude faster than before, creating new demand for a significant amount of electronic parts.
Murata’s strengths ensure we can seize business opportunities (chances)
Networks, technology development capacity, monozukuri capabilities, and organizational cooperation to integrate these elements
believe that has three strong points which enable us to steadily seize these expanding business opportunities and sustain growth.
The first is “‘a global network and deep customer base through which we can speedily understand customer needs.” Since its foundation, Murata’s mainstay business has been capacitors and other general-purpose electronic parts. large number of these general-purpose electronic parts are used for various kinds of electronic devices and contacts customers in various fields all around the world. Therefore, we can quickly see the latest market information and needs. has satisfied various customer needs worldwide and established a structure under which products and services are supplied stably. Currently, sales in overseas markets account for more than 90% of total sales and a large variety of products have captured the largest or second largest share in the global market. Furthermore, Murata’s global network mostly consists of networks at our group organizations, enabling strong cooperation. Thus, we are able to communicate with many customers in various industries and quickly understand their demands and emerging needs.
The second is “‘technology development capacity’ which realizes customer needs.” As trends in electronics markets change, to satisfy customer needs which are increasingly diversified with the times, has expanded the boundaries of value that we can offer,from smaller, higher performance single-function components to more highly functional device components, and further to modules incorporating those components and solutions. To create unique and highly competitive products, we are conducting technology development ahead of competitors and internally developing materials, processes, products and production technology for many products. These are vertically integrated for realizing rapid product commercialization.
The third is “‘monozukuri (manufacturing) capabilities’ ensuring mass production and timely delivery to customers.” At Murata, each plant has independently and uniquely improved its processes over many years to enhance productivity and cost competitiveness. Through these accumulated technologies and expertise, reliable production can be realized on a large scale. Particularly, the production volume of multilayer ceramic capacitors, one of the core products of Murata, exceeds one trillion per year despite its highly complex production process, placing them on the largest scale in the industry.
And then, the three strong points described above of networks, technology development capacity, and monozukuri capabilities are integrated through Murata’s organizational cooperation. At Murata, each function of the value chain closely works together and by integrating individual strong points into that of the entire organization, is making efforts to provide better value to customers.
Driving forces supporting strength
Penetration of the “Philosophy” and innovation driven by CS/ES
As stated above, has continued to demonstrate its unique strengths since its foundation, because the ideals and values shared by all employees work as driving
forces.
Sharing of the “Philosophy” as prescribed by our founder is placed in the most important position. regards the “Philosophy” as a philosophy which serves as a major guideline for its business activities. As the scale of business expands and employees are diversified, to demonstrate collective strength through cooperation among employees with a sense of unity, it is important that all employees understand the “Philosophy” well as a common ideal. For example, innovation described in Philosophy indicates that development of a pioneering spirit is important for any job in addition to avoidance of price competition through unique products with higher added value. Also, regarding contribution to the advancement of society, it links to continued awareness of the social significance of our company’s existence.
The recent focus on “CS” and “ES” that set out as important values is also a concept derived from a passage of Philosophy – thankful for the increase in prosperity – in addition to the above.
We define “CS” as continuing “to create and provide value that customers appreciate” and “ES” as ensuring “each and every employee feels rewarded and continues to grow through his or her work.”
creates a virtuous cycle in its business activities by placing importance on the values of and to create new innovation. This virtuous cycle is a driving force for reinforcing Murata’s strengths even further.
What we should be
Contribute to development of a new future as an “Innovator in Electronics”
In addition to contribution to society through products and services, has established a Charter with the Philosophy as a benchmark and a Management Committee to fulfill various types of social responsibility.

Ultra Low power Short Range RF-ICOur Expectations of Suppliers
Our Expectations of Suppliers
In operating a global business, is expected not only to fulfill its own social responsibility but also to see to it that its suppliers throughout the supply chain do likewise. Accordingly, we ask our suppliers to observe the following commitments.
1.Comply with laws and social norms
We request our suppliers to:
Comply with laws and social norms applicable in the countries or regions in which they do business, such as compliance with anti-trust laws, commercial laws, laws pertaining to subcontracting, foreign exchange laws, personal information protection laws, copyright laws, laws pertaining to labor, legislation pertaining to safety and hygiene, and environmental laws, etc.;
Prohibit the use of child labor or forced labor;
Respect human rights;
Provide a safe and clean work environment; and
Prohibit bribery and unfair acts or practices.
2.Sound business practices
We request that our suppliers follow sound and fair business practices to enable continual business transactions and build collaborative trusting relationships. We also ask our suppliers to disclose to appropriate information on their management policies and business conditions, including financial situations.
3.Quality, delivery performance, and stable supply
stresses quality and delivery performance in order to provide customers with better quality products in a timely manner. Accordingly, we expect our suppliers to meet quality and delivery commitments and to provide a stable supply of materials.
4.Green procurement
emphasizes green procurement in order to provide customers with products that have less of an environmental impact. We therefore seek to deal with suppliers who have established management systems and can provide materials with a smaller environmental footprint.
5.Value Engineering
Technical innovation is very fast paced and product life cycles are extremely short in the electronic device industry, which is also challenged by severe price competition. These pressures continuously require us to develop new products and offer them at reasonable prices. As such, we strive to deal with suppliers who can provide new materials and cost improvements through Value Engineering.
6.Information provision
With technical innovation in the electronic device industry constantly in high gear, dealing with these innovations is a constant challenge. Moreover, regulations related to protection of the global environment and environmental requests from customers are increasing year by year. Because of this, we must constantly obtain information on new technologies and new products (materials). We therefore seek to deal with suppliers who can provide such information.
7.Initiatives to reduce procurement lead-time
As indicated above, technical innovation is very fast paced and product life cycles are extremely short in the electronic device industry. This is just as true at Murata, where reducing the lead-time for material procurement is one of our most important issues, in order to ensure customer satisfaction by responding promptly and flexibly to client requests. This is why we expect our suppliers to shorten material procurement lead-times to rapidly and flexibly deal with market changes.
8.Observance of confidentiality
We try as much as possible to provide our suppliers with information that is needed to complete transactions. Some of the information provided includes Murata’s trade secrets. Accordingly, we seek to deal with suppliers who can and will keep the information provided confidential.
9.Utilization of information technology
We believe that exchanging information with our suppliers through information technology and networks is vital for accelerating our business operations and strengthening our relationships with suppliers. Therefore, we seek to deal with suppliers who can prepare and utilize an information technology environment.
10.Rejection of organized crime
We do not conduct business with companies that have ties to organized crime groups, commonly known as “anti-social forces” in Japan.
We therefore demand that our suppliers do not do business with companies associated with organized crime.
11.Promoting “Responsible Minerals Procurement”
is working to address the procurement of minerals contained in products in line with a policy it has established on the matter. 
We expect our suppliers to understand our policy, to complete a supply chain survey, to exercise due diligence, to institute their own policy for addressing the issue, to establish and implement an internal management system, and to source minerals only from conformant smelters as part of a commitment to ensuring that delivered products are conflict-free.
