Privacy policynew faculty join our world class team
We are recruiting best and brightest in scientific world to build our research teams in key areas, including cancer and regenerative medicine.
There are more than 60 principal investigators at who lead research teams in disease areas including cancer, reproductive biology, immunology, metabolic processes, neuroscience and microbiome. Our scientists come from laboratories all over world, and we continue to recruit top-notch researchers.
Here are latest scientists to join our team.
Cancer research
Connecticut Children's Medical Center, for Genomic Medicine, and UConn School of Medicine have made their first joint appointment: distinguished pediatric oncologist and cancer researcher Ching Lau, M.D., Ph.Dr. Lau serves as Professor at JAX, where he specializes in pediatric brain and bone tumor research. He is also Medical Director of Hematology-Oncology at Connecticut Children's and Head of Division of Pediatric Hematology-Oncology in Department of Pediatrics at UConn School of Medicine.
has named medical oncologist Jens Rueter, M.D., to newly created position of medical director for Maine Cancer Genomics Initiative (MCGI), a partnership with community hospitals to help Maine cancer patients and their physicians access precision cancer care. Rueter comes to from Eastern Maine Medical Center Cancer Care and will be based at Harold Alfond Center for Cancer Care of MaineGeneral Health in Augusta.
Cell biology
Internationally recognized geneticist and muscle degeneration expert Se-Jin Lee, M.D., Ph.D., accepted joint faculty appointments at and UConn Health in February. Lee, whose research focuses on muscular dystrophies and other muscle wasting conditions, will establish his at Genomic Medicine. Lee comes to from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where he earned his and Ph.degrees. He is a member of National Academy of Sciences, a fellow of American Association for Advancement of Science, and received prestigious Ho-Am Prize in Medicine in 2013.

Christine Beck, Ph., a genomics expert in transposable elements and their impact on human disease, joined Genomic Medicine and UConn Health as their fifth joint-appointed faculty. Beck comes to and UConn Health from Baylor College of Medicine, where she completed her postdoctoral work as a research fellow in of Dr. James Lupski, M.D., Ph.Beck earned her Ph.in human genetics at University of Michigan, and her in biochemistry at Iowa State University. 
Ryan Tewhey, Ph.D., develops new molecular tools to explore areas of genome involved in regulation — turning genes on and off. Tewhey has joined (JAX) faculty as an assistant professor, where he plans to explore those regulatory variants and how they impact health. Tewhey just completed a postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard University and Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass., where he led a team that improved a technique to precisely “barcode” minute fragments of in order to track their role in contributing to diseases.
Se-Jin Lee — Muscle Degenerative Diseases
Se-Jin Lee, M.D., Ph.D., an internationally renowned geneticist focused on discovering causes and cures for muscle degenerative diseases like muscular dystrophy and muscle wasting conditions resulting from diseases such as cancer and sepsis, will join UConn Health and as a joint faculty appointment.
Ching Lau — Pediatric Cancer
Connecticut Children's Medical Center, for Genomic Medicine, and UConn School of Medicine have made their first joint appointment: distinguished pediatric oncologist and cancer researcher Ching Lau, M.D., Ph.. Dr. Lau will serve as Professor at JAX, where he will specialize in pediatric brain and bone tumor research.
Mark Adams — Microbiome
Genomics pioneer and bioinformatics expert Mark Adams, Ph., joined as director of Microbial Genomic Services. Adams has an extensive background in industry, government, academic and nonprofit settings, where he has focused on applying genomic and bioinformatic approaches to biological research.
Jens Rueter — Medical Director for Maine Cancer Genomics Initiative
has named medical oncologist Jens Rueter, M.D., (left) to newly created position of medical director for Maine Cancer Genomics Initiative (MCGI), a partnership with community hospitals to help Maine cancer patients and their physicians access precision cancer care.
