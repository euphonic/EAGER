About Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)
What is heart disease?
Coronary artery disease (CAD),
 also called coronary 
heart disease
, or simply 
heart
 disease, happens when plaque builds up in the arteries, blocking blood flow. It can lead to a heart attack and can cause permanent damage to the heart muscle.
Over time, can weaken the heart muscle, contributing to heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms, called 
arrhythmias
. If the heart can't pump blood effectively, the lungs, brain and other organs won't work properly and may be damaged or even shut down.
For both men and women, is the leading cause of death around the world.

Heart disease is one of several cardiovascular diseases - disorders of the heart and blood vessels. Other cardiovascular diseases include stroke and high blood pressure.
