History
History
tale of two families, 200 years strong.
AstenJohnson’s history
 in the paper industry dates back to 1790, when the Johnson family opened Manchester Wire Works in Manchester, England. Nearly 100 years later, the Asten family launched Asten and Company in Belgium, producing felts for European papermakers. The family then started a separate company Asten-Hill Manufacturing Company in Philadelphia in 1931, thirty years after the Johnsons began operations in Montreal.
In 1999, Asten, Inc. and the Group merged; they acquired Asten in Eupen, Belgium the following year. Additional changes and acquisitions quickly followed, including the 2003 addition of a sales and marketing office in Singapore, the 2004 opening of a new manufacturing facility in Suzhou, China, and the 2005 acquisition of Czech Republic-based manufacturer, Sitos.
Today, products are at work in mills throughout the world. Our products help create many kinds of paper, from fine writing press and newsprint to brown paper bags and cardboard boxes. Papermakers in 56 countries trust in and profit from our headbox-to-reel understanding of their operations.

Sustainability
At AstenJohnson, sustainable business practices have long been central to who we are as an organization. With stewardship guiding our company as a core value, we strive to manage all resources with deep wisdom and great care. Through prudent selection of raw materials, minimizing of facility waste, and adoption of energy efficient processes, all our production, transportation, and logistics are designed to monitor and reduce environmental impact. We equally commit ourselves to delivering the best for our people. Creating a safe, fair workplace marked by constant improvement, principled business ethics, and financial integrity, we enthusiastically advance the rich legacy over two hundred years in the making.   
In 2015, our global sustainability practices were officially formalized in alignment with best practices through a partnership with third-party consultants, Strategic Sustainability Consulting. This effort identified the key performance measures by which we now mindfully guide our operations and established a framework for regular public reporting that measures and documents the ongoing sustainability practices of our organization.
Our history of service to the pulp and paper industry dates back to the 1700s. Today, we still stand side by side with papermakers around the globe to eagerly maintain the spirit and camaraderie of our shared passion and craft, while boldly innovating its future. Further, as our longstanding expertise in manufacturing processes and products finds new application through our family of companies, we pledge to manage our environmental footprint, protect all workers, and conduct business in a manner that weaves our next century as carefully and conscientiously as the last.
