In 1996, AT&spun off its communications equipment division – as well as associated Bell Labs research assets – into Lucent Technologies. Lucent and Alcatel merged in 2006 to become Alcatel-Lucent. As a result of this transaction, was established to be Alcatel-Lucent’s sole sales and contracting channel for all classified and unclassified business with the federal government. At that time, was a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alcatel-Lucent, and retained the Government Communications Lab (GCL) portion of Bell Labs within the organization.
In 2014 was acquired by Madison Dearborn Partners, an investment firm based in Chicago, Illinois, and CoVant, a holding company based in the Washington, metro area, focused on acquiring and growing companies in the federal technology solutions marketplace.
In October 2015, acquired Axios Engineering, a provider of communications and signal processing solutions and mission support services for the defense and intelligence communities. An industry leader in mission-attached services and application development, Axios closely complements offerings in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) technologies, and extends mission-proven networking solutions to in-theater, tactical operational environments.
