Together with our partners and suppliers, we work to provide innovative life-saving and sustaining products and therapies to patients and providers around the world.
We are committed to continually finding new ways to improve our environmental performance and promote supplier diversity, all while nurturing innovation to address the unmet needs of patients today and for decades to come.
We consider several environmental and social factors as we integrate sustainable practices into our procurement processes. We collaborate with our suppliers to identify opportunities to improve environmental performance, such as reducing energy use, greenhouse gas emissions and waste.

We also promote human rights throughout our supplier base and seek to maximize procurement opportunities from small, minority, women, LGBT, disabled and veteran business enterprises by proactively identifying qualified suppliers.
We consider price, quality, environmental criteria and other factors when selecting and evaluating our suppliers. We do this with the intent to develop sustainable growth plans and build sound partnerships within all areas of our supply chain.
The automation of business transactions can help enable savings, efficiencies and accuracy across the revenue cycle. We support both Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), for direct connection between provider and supplier, and Internet-commerce, which connects buyers and sellers via a common technology platform to place orders and receive invoices online. We are also part of the Global Exchange (GHX), the first Internet (supplier) exchange for the industry.
Through our contract manufacturing business, we work with pharmaceutical companies to support their commercialization objectives by providing scientific expertise, sterile contract manufacturing solutions, parenteral delivery systems and customized support services needed to meet the unique challenges that parenteral products face.

Our Story
Our more than 85-year heritage gives us distinct perspective on the needs of patients and caregivers. We lead today by putting those insights to work to deliver new, better solutions and access to care in the communities where we live and work.
Patients
​Innovation is at our core.  For more than 85 years, we’ve been focused on saving and sustaining lives and elevating patient care.
​1930s: Our First Decade of Innovation
1931: Drs. Ralph Falk and Don launched the Don Intravenous Products Corporation, the first commercial manufacturer of prepared solutions.
Not long after our founding, we introduced the TRANSFUSO-container for blood collection and storage, which made blood banking practical and allowed storage for up to 21 days. 
By the decade’s end, we changed our name to Laboratories, Inc. and opened our first manufacturing facility in a renovated automobile showroom in Glenview, Illinois.
1940s – 1960s: Industry Breakthroughs
1941: We introduced the PLASMA-container, which for the first time allowed plasma to be separated from whole blood for storage.
1948: We launched an unbreakable plastic container for blood storage.
1950: Our second manufacturing facility opened in Cleveland, Mississippi. Two years later, we became the first company to make commercially available human plasma following our acquisition of Hyland Laboratories.
1954: We went international, opening an office in Belgium. Two years later, Dutch physician Willem Kolff developed the first “artificial kidney,” which was made from wood slats, orange juice cans and a cellophane membrane. Building from his work, we produced the first commercial dialysis system later that year.
1960: We introduced the first peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution. filters waste from the blood of people in renal failure through their peritoneal membrane rather than an external dialyzer. year later, we began trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
1970s – 1990s: Expanding our Global Presence and Innovations
1970: We introduced VIAFLEX, the first flexible, plastic container. This medical breakthrough allowed infusions within a closed system, which reduced the chance for contamination.
1971: Our company joined the Fortune 500 list of the largest American corporations. We also opened an solutions manufacturing facility in North Carolina – to this day one of our largest.
Our MINI-plastic containers came on market in 1974, making ready-to-use premixed drugs available to hospitals. We moved to our current headquarters in Deerfield, Illinois, the next year.
We launched several products in the 1980s, including the pump, which allowed patients to receive therapy in any setting.
1985: We acquired American Hospital Supply Corporation, a distribution company.   
1991: Our Access System launched, introducing the first “needleless” system for therapy.
1994: HOMECHOICE, our automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) system, launched. We also opened a plant in Singapore to make peritoneal dialysis solutions for the Asian market.
1998: Our acquisition of Ohmeda’s Pharmaceutical Products Division made a leader in inhaled anesthetics.  That same year, we introduced the first triple-chamber flexible container for total parenteral nutrition and gained approval for our product, the first fibrin sealant in the   
2000s: New Millennium of Innovation
The early part of the decade was notable for a series of regulatory clearances for some of our core products. These included:
EXTRANEAL, a non-glucose-based solution;
ADVATE, the first recombinant factor concentrate for hemophilia made without any added human or animal proteins in the cell culture;
FLEXBUMIN, the first albumin in a flexible, plastic container; and
SEVOFLURANE, an inhaled anesthetic used in surgery.
2007: We introduced V-LINK, the first connector with an antimicrobial coating. few years later, we received clearance for ARTISS, the first commercially available slow-setting fibrin sealant used to adhere skin grafts in burn patients.
2011: Ventures launched and became a new way for us to identify and fund innovation. We also acquired Baxa Corporation to enhance our pharmacy automation offerings.
2012: We acquired Sigma, a manufacturer of smart infusion pumps, and Synovis Life Technologies, Inc., a leading microsurgery products company.
2013: We acquired AB, a global innovator in renal care. We also received European Union marketing approval for Sealing Hemostat, which helps control bleeding in a variety of surgical scenarios.
2015: We spun off our BioScience business to focus on hospital, nutrition, renal and surgical care. We also launched with SHARESOURCE,  the first system with user-friendly features that help guide end-stage renal disease patients through home peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy, while keeping them remotely connected with their providers.
2016: In Europe, we launched G13E, the only triple-chamber, ready-to-use parenteral nutrition system approved for preterm infants. Also, HDx enabled by our is a new dialysis therapy we are pioneering for patients with end-stage renal disease. The dialyzer features an innovative membrane, which provides an expanded hemodialysis therapy (HDx).
2017: New versions of our and hemostatic agents launched. We acquired Claris Injectables Limited, a generic injectable pharmaceutical company, and announced new research and clinical development collaborations  with leading institutions including Mayo Clinic and Ramot at Tel Aviv University/Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center .
2018: Our system launched in Japan, reflecting local needs and demographics, and making it a viable treatment option for renal patients there.Utility Menu

Remote Patient Management Gives Peritoneal Dialysis Patient Peace of Mind
Didi has lived with diabetes for many years, which can be a leading contributor to kidney disease. Still, learning her kidneys were failing was a shock. Fortunately, she had the support of her family and providers to explore the therapy options that met her clinical and lifestyle needs. Didi decided home peritoneal dialysis (PD) was the right path for her.
Originally from the Philippines, Didi came to the United States to obtain her Master’s degree, during which time she met her husband, traveled extensively and has now lived in Illinois for the past 37 years. Married with three grown children and several grandchildren, Didi and her husband live an active lifestyle.
Didi manages her home therapy on the automated peritoneal dialysis system with the remote patient management platform. allows providers to securely view their patients’ recently completed home dialysis-related treatment data that is automatically collected after each session. providers can then act on this information by remotely adjusting their patients’ home device settings without requiring them to travel to the clinic.
“My home dialysis system talks me through therapy; it’s like having a friend in the room with you,” said Didi. “My favorite part of the system is its remote connectivity feature, because know my nurse can see how my treatments are going and call if something doesn’t look right.”
Today, Didi has been able to largely resume the lifestyle she enjoyed before she began dialysis treatment, spending time with family and pursuing her hobbies and other interests.
“The kidneys are a horrible thing to lose, Didi added. “I’m thankful to have the opportunity to live as normally as possible.”
Didi is able to live the life she wants by doing home dialysis on the automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) system with remote patient management platform. “My home dialysis system talks me through therapy; it's like having a friend in the room with you.”
