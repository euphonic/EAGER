​Enhance Memory and Skill Learning While Sleeping
Researchers at Imaging, have developed a new approach that enhances memory and skill learning while people sleep. In experiments conducted on over 100 human subjects, they demonstrated an up to 25% improvement in memory compared to subjects that did not use the new device.
The approach leverages a phenomenon in the brain called memory replay which is thought to be involved in the transfer of information from short-term to long-term memory (a process termed consolidation) that takes place during sleep. The research focused on detecting biomarkers that indicated the brain was in the critical period of memory consolidation. Then,  by applying either a short sound or noninvasive electrical stimulation, they could trigger a boost in learning. The research suggests that this closed-loop approach, which tightly couples and prescribes interventions based on ongoing brain activity in real-time, significantly improves learning in real-world tasks in people.
The research was conducted as part of a large scale collaboration with researchers from RioGrande Neurosciences, the University of California at Riverside, and Intific Inc., and funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Restoring Active Memory (RAM) Replay program.
As part of their ongoing research, has demonstrated that this approach improves learning across a number of domains. First, it improved learning to navigate a new 3environment simulated in virtual reality. Here, participants who received the closed-loop intervention realized an almost 40% benefit in their navigation time compared to controls, indicating an increase in understanding and retention of the virtual city layout. Second, they have also demonstrated significant effects in boosting memory on more standard educational material. For example, they found that noninvasive electrical stimulation could improve an individual's test scores on lecture material by >10% (a full letter grade improvement) two days after the material was learned without any additional study of the material.  Finally, ongoing work is demonstrating an over 15% improvement on memory tests of facts.
 “Through this research we have gained great confidence that these approaches can make a difference in people's lives by enhancing learning on a number of different tasks.", says Dr. Stephen Simons who is the lead investigator for Teledyne's team on the project. “Furthermore, the noninvasive nature of these interventions and their application during sleep means that these benefits can be realized with minimal disruption to people's everyday routines."

Achieves Success in Live Fire Testing of Guided Munitions Under DARPA'Program
OAKS, Calif. – September 3, 2014 – Technologies Incorporated (NYSE:TDY) announced today that its subsidiary, Imaging, LLC, recently demonstrated the first-ever precision guided munition capability in live fire testing of guided .50 caliber bullets under the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Tactical Technology Office’s EXtreme ACcuracy Tasked Ordnance (EXACTO) program. The objective of the program is to develop and demonstrate a highly accurate small caliber weapon system capable of addressing moving targets at extreme ranges and in high winds.
“We are pleased to have successfully demonstrated such an advanced capability designed to further empower our military personnel,” said Robert Mehrabian, Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Teledyne.
Teledyne’s team for the program includes Alliant Techsystems, Cubic Defense Applications, the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory, and Brown Engineering, Inc.
Technologies Incorporated is a leading provider of sophisticated instrumentation, digital products and software, aerospace and defense electronics, and engineered systems. Technologies’ operations are primarily located in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Western and Northern Europe.

Bi-porous wick structures for heat pipe and vapor chamber. (image below)
​
Company carries out R&in thermal management for power technology. The goal is to provide effective thermal management solutions for electronic packaging by exploiting advanced cooling technology, effective thermal analysis, experimental validation and prototype demonstration.
 We use active and passive approaches to achieve high power density electronics packaging. This includes closed loop spray/microjet array cooling and high-heat flux pipes. In addition, a miniature refrigeration system for chip level cooling has been developed based on thermoacoustics principles.
 Controlling acoustics and vibrations is critical to sensitive electronic and optical assembly. We develop sonic crystals for vibration and sound isolation at specified frequency bands. The engineered crystal is continuum-based or truss-like in structure. The sonic crystal lattice can be one to two orders smaller than the corresponding wavelengths it controls. This allows for significant acoustic wave control at low frequencies.
