WeChatMobility for Everyone™
is a mobility technology company—the only automotive supplier with deep systems knowledge and expertise across the entire vehicle.
We are racing to transform the mobility landscape.
Our Operations
We are forging new paths to being a greener company by focusing on environmentally responsible world-class manufacturing.
The cornerstone of our sustainability effort centers on responsibly managing our manufacturing emissions and improving our energy efficiency.
Our Steyr facility in Graz, Austria
and
our Polycon Industries plant in Guelph, Ontario are two among many of the operations that have been recognized by utility providers and local governments for achievements in environmental responsibility.
We pride ourselves on our conservation awards, including one from Enbridge Gas Distribution, which recognized us for 16 energy-efficient projects that achieved an annual natural gas savings of 2.75 million cubic meters, the carbon emission equivalent of planting more than 1,600 trees.
For 2018, our green initiatives continue to grow.
On a manufacturing level, we not only make compliance our highest priority, we also are making advances in maximizing efficiencies while minimizing waste.
Today, our plants have an “energy champion” and an energy savings team that meets monthly with the goal of conserving resources. Renewed focus is placed on everything from saving water to cutting down on leaks in
compressed
air during the manufacturing process. New shutdown procedures for plants that don’t run 24/7 are in place as part of a new conservation push.
The commitment to sustainability carries on through our products, including our ability to design and manufacture lightweight vehicle solutions and our development of innovative powertrain products to improve the environmental impact of passenger vehicles.
In cooperation with the Department of Energy, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles
and
Grupo Antolin, we developed a new ultralight door module that will help global automakers develop greener vehicles through
lightweighting
.
Our carbon-fiber subframe reduces vehicle mass by 34 percent compared to stamped steel, yet another way to make cars and trucks more environmentally friendly.
The new products in our portfolio include powertrain systems and modules for vehicles equipped with 48-volt systems or mild hybrids as well as high-voltage systems including full hybrid, plug-in hybrid
and
electric vehicle powertrains.
Magna’s inventive mix of materials and technologies is tackling the challenge of weight reduction in vehicles to save fuel and cut vehicle emissions.
By being encouraged to think like entrepreneurs and visionaries, our employees always have green solutions in the pipeline.
Our Partners/Suppliers
Sustainability means sharing ideas and best practices with our employees and suppliers around the globe to improve the efficient use of resources, minimize waste, and use innovative design and engineering to reduce the environmental impact of our processes and products.
We supply our global customer base by manufacturing close to our major markets, including Asia, Europe
and
the Americas. This strategy shortens the supply chain, which cuts fuel consumption and emissions, benefits the environment, and encourages the growth of local suppliers.
Magna’s global facilities are encouraged to use recyclable materials to minimize waste and take other steps to manage the environmental impact of our manufacturing process.
We pledge to work with our partners and suppliers to develop products and processes that are smarter, safer, cleaner and lighter as part of our ongoing commitment to sustainability.

ENDED
30, 2018
We set third quarter records for sales, diluted earnings per share and Adjusted diluted earnings per share, and returned
$629 million
to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. All of our operating segments reported sales growth compared to the third quarter of 2017 and, excluding both acquisitions net of divestitures and foreign exchange movements, sales for all segments outgrew global light vehicle production. However, our sales were slightly lower than we had anticipated, mainly due to lower than expected light vehicle production. Adjusted was below the comparable quarter in 2017 and was less than what we expected.  After taking into account the impact of lower than anticipated volumes, our Power & Vision, Seating Systems and Complete Vehicles segments performed substantially in line with our expectations. However, our Body Exteriors & Structures segment reported results below our expectations, mainly as a result of higher than anticipated launch costs and underperformance at certain facilities, largely offset by a favourable customer pricing resolution. 
On a consolidated basis, we posted sales of
$9.62 billion
for the third quarter of 2018, an increase of 9% over the third quarter of 2017. The strong growth was achieved in a period in which light vehicle production increased 4% in
North America
Europe
. Excluding the impact of foreign currency translation and net divestitures, sales increased 11% on a consolidated basis, and by segment: 6% in both Body Exteriors & Structures and Power & Vision, 5% in Seating Systems, and 50% in Complete Vehicles.
Adjusted of
$699 million
in the third quarter of 2018 decreased 1.0%, resulting in an adjusted as a percentage of sales of 7.3% in the third quarter of 2018 compared to 8.0% in the third quarter of 2017.  This margin decline was largely driven by:
an increase in the proportion of sales generated in our Complete Vehicles segment relative to total sales, which have a significantly lower margin than our consolidated average;
lower margins in the third quarter of 2018 in our Seating Systems segment, mainly associated with pre-operating costs incurred at new facilities and favourable customer pricing resolutions in the third quarter of 2017; and
lower margins in our Power & Vision segment, largely reflecting increased spending for electrification and autonomy.
Income from operations before income taxes of
$674 million
Net income attributable to
$554 million
for the third quarter of 2018, substantially reflecting a lower income tax rate.
Diluted earnings per share increased 17% to
$1.62

, and the favourable impact of a reduced share count.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12% to

In the third quarter of 2018, we generated cash from operations before changes in operating assets and liabilities of
