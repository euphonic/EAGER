Effective January 5, 2018
Framework for Promoting CSR
Committee was established in March 2017 to promote socially responsible operations and sustainable development. The Internal Control Department (currently the Office of Initiatives) acts as Secretariat. It is chaired by the President & Representative Director, and comprised of the full-time members of the Board of Directors and the heads of the corporate departments.
The Committee is responsible for and authorized to formulate the basic guidelines concerning for the group as a whole, discuss and approve goals for each year, monitor and review activities, foster within the company, formulate and foster charters and codes of corporate behavior, investigate and address compliance-related issues, and discuss and make decisions concerning the establishment of rules for risk management, etc. It met on nine occasions between March and December 2017.
In 2017, the Internal Control Department undertook the hands-on work for promoting from March to September. In the remaining months of the year, this was done by the Internal Audit Department, which reports directly to the President, and has been done by the Office of Initiatives since March, 2018.
Framework for Promoting CSR
Management
From April to December 2017 (when was still consolidated with Seiko Instruments Inc.), the Committee led the way in formulating the annual goals and putting in place a framework for compliance, risk management, labor health and safety, etc. for the forthcoming de-consolidation in January 2018. Specifically, it provided relevant company regulations, educated members of the board, division heads, and rank-and-file employees about compliance, put in place a framework and systems concerning risk management for the as a whole, unified the management of labor safety and health, and undertook the sharing of information and education for the as a whole.
The plan is to promote activities in accordance with PDCA-style management (plan, do, check, act) by having the Committee discuss and approve the annual goals that will be formulated by each department in accordance with the new Policy from January 2018. The idea is to phase in management across other companies in the group and have it pursued by the group as a whole.
Outline of Management
Goals
Each department is considering and formulating goals for CSR-related activities in accordance with the new Policy. This led to the drawing up a Plan for 2018, which has been in effect since April 2018.
Activities for spreading knowledge about inside the were carried out in 2016 and 2017 to foster greater understanding about and familiarity with the Policy. study session was organized for members of the Board of Directors in 2016. Sixteen people took part. In the following year, a total of five seminars were organized for managerial staff and rank-and-file employees. They were attended by about 600 members of staff.

The origin of our products lies in the development of ICs for quartz watches. We downsized quartz mechanisms from the size of a locker to something small enough to be worn on a wrist, and succeeded in bringing to production analog semiconductors that function accurately while using only a minute amount of energy. The safe and reliable leading-edge technology cultivated through our research and manufacturing is seeing increasing utilization in the latest key devices, including those for automobiles, smartphones, and healthcare.

AcceptPart3 “S-85S1Series” and “S-1740/1741 Series”, New IoRegulators respond to a request by a startup company
10/29/2018
Techanalye Co.,Ltd.
This time, introduce the new function, “the Supply Voltage Divided Output” which is prepared both in the Ultrahigh Efficiency Switching Regulator “ S-85S1Series ” and the Voltage Regulator “ S-1740/1741 Series ”.
Regulators are indispensable for supplying stable voltages and it is also important to monitor remaining battery life for battery-powered products such as mobile, wearable and Iodevices. Existing and other companies’ regulators did not have this function and battery voltage divider had to be processed using external circuit to monitor the battery life (see left of the Figure 1).
Fig.1 The new function “Supply Voltage Divided Output” in the S-85S1P
“Supply Voltage Divided Output Regulator” is the regulator which a supply voltage divided output feature is added to. As in the right of the Figure 1, “the Supply Voltage Divided Output” circuit is included in the regulator and it divides the input voltage (Vin), outputs the voltage through the buffer, and inputs the voltage into a A/converter pin of a microcontroller to make it possible to monitor the voltage. It resolves the problems in the external circuit such as the variation of the resistances, the input impedance mismatch with the A/converter and so on. It increases the accurate understanding of the remaining battery life, reduces the mounting area and improves the power performance because of integrating the external circuit into the regulator (See Figure 2). This function which brings “throwing one stone to get three birds” into reality was accomplished not only by the ABLIC’s effort but also by a startup company’s request.
Fig.2 “Supply Voltage Divided Output Regulator” make it possible to connect to a microcontroller A/converter directly and…
High accuracy : No variation of the resistances, No input impedance mismatch with a
A/converter on a microcontroller
Miniaturization : Remove external circuit and reduce the mounting area
Power performance improvement : Self-current consumption of the “supply voltage divided output” is reduced to 280 n(typical).
The company is Braveridge Co., Ltd which is based at Kyushu, develops and produces Iodevices as well as develops and manufactures low power wireless modules such as (Bluetooth Low Energy), LoRaand (see footnote). To develop Iodevices which meet these standard specifications, the monitoring remaining battery life function which enables low power consumption and long-term battery life is essential. It is preferable to be designed as small as possible to improve the use-friendliness of the –portable devices. To realize these requests, developed the “Supply Voltage Divided Output Regulator”. Figure 3 shows the Braveridge’s Human Tracker which S-85S1is mounted in.

Generally, venture companies don’t have ample money and they have small human resources. Therefore, they have some superior technologies, but it is difficult to say they have a wide variety of skills. However, they have a passion for technology and innovation. They have a great source of ideas.
ABLIC’s activity doesn’t only invest in a venture companies but also provides technical support and cultivates their business. invests into Japanese new business fields through supporting the startup companies.
does not support them unilaterally. incorporates their fresh ideas, converts the vector from “Product-Out”, which is a concept that a company assumes a use case and a specification inside a company and develops the products, to “Market-In”, which is a concept that a company focuses on the customer’s requirements, and develops a new products which are improved usability, development efficiency and cost efficiency. It would not be obtained by conventional methods.
“Supply Voltage Divided Output Regulator” is the product developed utilizing the advantages of the startup company and the historic old company, that is, Japanese old and new organization.
Note : LoRaWAN、SIGFOX…One of the standard specification to provide LPWA（Low Power Wide Area, Wireless communication technologies for battery-efficient and ubiquitous wide-area connectivity). Both use unlicensed band frequencies.
