Inheriting the Seiko Instruments Inc. business and continuing to evolve, Inc. is a maker of analog semiconductors.
HOME
Corporate Profile
Vision
SMALL
Developing and manufacturing 
ultra-small products
SMART
Providing power-saving analog 
semiconductors leading to a “smart” society
SIMPLE
Providing simple, easy-to-use products 
contributing to miniaturization and cost reduction
The origin of our products lies in the development of ICs for quartz watches. We downsized quartz mechanisms from the size of a locker to something small enough to be worn on a wrist, and succeeded in bringing to production analog semiconductors that function accurately while using only a minute amount of energy. The safe and reliable leading-edge technology cultivated through our research and manufacturing is seeing increasing utilization in the latest key devices, including those for automobiles, smartphones, and healthcare.
