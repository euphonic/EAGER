Overview
is pioneering the use of immunosequencing to revolutionize patient care. We translate the scale and precision of the immune system into products to diagnose and treat disease.
We believe in the power and brilliance of the immune system and its potential to cure. Our knowledge, passion, and willingness to challenge assumptions–and each other–will make a difference for patients and change the course of medicine.
HISTORY
It was in a cafeteria at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, where Dr. Harlan Robins, Dr. Chris Carlson 
and
 Dr. Edus Warren were collaborating on a research project. Over lunch one day, they started asking questions related to isolating and amplifying T-cell receptors from the human genome when they had an “aha!” moment.
Shortly after, in 2009, was born. The brain-child of two brothers (Chad and Harlan Robins) with one mission - to change the course of medicine and improve patient care worldwide. Over the years has successfully gained the interest of strong investors, academic organizations 
and
 customers who understand the importance of sequencing the immune system in order to revolutionize the way we discover, diagnose and treat diseases.
To further the momentum, in 2015, acquired Sequenta, Inc., a South San Francisco-based company dedicated to improving patient care in diseases mediated by immune cells through the discovery and development of novel clinical diagnostics. The company also launched its therapeutic effort to become a leading discovery company to enable TCR-based cellular therapy development.
In 2018, announced a partnership with Microsoft Research’s Healthcare Nexinitiative to combine high-throughput 
immunosequencing
 and expert bioinformatics with machine learning and artificial intelligence, to map the entire human immune system and change the way diseases are diagnosed. By combining Adaptive’s powerful immune sequencing technologies with Microsoft’s research and large-scale machine learning and cloud computing capabilities, the partners aim to create individual disease diagnostics and ultimately a universal diagnostic – all from a simple blood test. 
Now with over 200 employees, three locations, and products and services in both the research and diagnostics segments, is not just a pioneer but also a leader in 
immunosequencing
 that will change the course of medicine worldwide.

Medical Oncologist, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center
Dr. Marco Davila is a medical oncologist who specializes in the treatment of patients with cancer.  Dr. Davila has a particular interest in patients with hematologic malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (B-ALL), and Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). As a translational physician-scientist, he is engaged in both clinical and laboratory research involving these malignancies.   Dr. Davila's laboratory develops gene-engineered cell therapies that target cancer cells in animal models of hematologic malignancies.  The goal of this laboratory research is to identify optimal cell therapies that can then be evaluated in patients with cancer.  As a former Principal Investigator of a clinical trial using genetically engineered cells targeted against malignant cells, he witnessed the potential for this as a cancer immunotherapy.  It's Dr. Davila's hope that his innovative laboratory and clinical research here at Vanderbilt will lead to similar therapeutic options for patients with other cancers that are not responsive to standard chemotherapy.

Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in Brussels
Dr. van der Bruggen studies the interactions between cancer cells and our immune system, with a particular focus on understanding why tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are unable to kill tumor cells, and finding strategies to overcome this blockage.
After completion of a Phthesis in plant phytopathology, Dr. van der Bruggen joined the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research in Brussels. He identified the first antigen recognized by a cytolytic lymphocyte on human cancer cells, as well as genes with the same expression profiles, such MAGE, and families. Dr. van der Bruggen also designed new approaches to identify antigenic peptides encoded by these genes. Several of them were used in clinical trials. Working with collaborators, Dr. van der Bruggen also set up approaches to detect anti-vaccine cell responses in vaccinated patients. He believes that progress in cancer therapeutic approaches, including vaccines, will depend on unraveling the different blockages for efficient tumor destruction. One of the blockages could be the immunosuppressive environment of the tumor.  Dr. van der Bruggen has published more than 100 primary research papers and reviews.

TUMORS
is validating a novel clinical diagnostic to quantify the presence and clonality of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) that is a reliable measure of “immunocompetence” to predict and monitor response to immune-modulating cancer therapies.
Preliminary data in variety of tumor types including colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer and glioblastoma suggest that a higher level of clonally expanded TILs may correlate with better patient outcomes. is invested in research and development to validate and incorporate into clinical practice this potentially new and meaningful immune molecular diagnostic for better prognostic staging of patients with solid tumors.
The assay is also actively being validated as a potential predictive diagnostic to monitor response to immune-modulating cancer therapeutics. Several human and mouse studies are assessing response to a variety of cancer immunotherapies including anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1). Preliminary results suggest that greater clonal expansion and percent tumor infiltration in tumor tissue prior to treatment may be predictive biomarkers of response.
POST-TRANSPLANT
The immunoSEQ® Assay is also being used to characterize immune reconstitution post-cord blood transplantation. key complication of cord blood transplantation is the high risk and rate of infection associated with non-relapse mortality. Today, the only predictive measure of infection risk is a cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) count of total T-cells present. In several research studies using the immunoAssay, T-cell diversity correlated with infection risk, whereas CD3 count does not.
T-(CTCL)
is a sub-type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that begins in the white blood cells and attacks the skin. There are several types of CTCLs, including mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome. Some patients develop progressive lethal disease, characterized by malignant cells that accumulate in the blood, skin and lymph nodes. Patients with these aggressive forms of are typically refractory to therapy and have a median survival of a mere three years.
THERAPEUTICS
is expanding its immunosequencing capabilities to include a new proprietary pairSEQ™ Assay that employs a pioneering process to combine Adaptive’s foundational immunoSEQ® Platform for sequencing each chain independently with a sophisticated bioinformatics framework to facilitate pairing of these chains. The identification of true alpha and beta chain pairs that form a specific has tremendous applications in ascribing functionality and therapeutic potential beyond current drug discovery approaches. The pairAssay enables highly accurate, rapid and scalable pairing of up to hundreds of thousands of alpha or beta sequences in a single experiment and can be applied to the process of therapeutic discovery, including the identification of highly promising TCRs for adoptive T-cell therapy.
