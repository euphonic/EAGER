Submitbuilds relationships to expand the reach of its protein engineering capabilities and applications
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is a science-led global health care company with a special purpose: to help people do more, feel better, live longer. In 2014, signed a license agreement with for use of their proprietary CodeEvolver® protein engineering platform technology to develop novel enzymes for more efficient and sustainable manufacture of GSK’s pharmaceutical and health care products.
Merck is a leading global biopharmaceutical company that has been inventing for life, bringing forward medicines and vaccines for many of the world’s most challenging diseases. Under a 2015 technology transfer and licensing agreement, completed transfer of its proprietary CodeEvolver®  protein engineering platform technology to enhance Merck’s capabilities by advancing and expanding the use of custom enzymes in pharmaceutical manufacturing processes.
Nestlé Health Science (NHSc) , a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nestlé, is a health-science company engaged in advancing the role of nutrition therapy to change the course of health for consumers, patients and its partners in health care. In 2017, and Nestlé Health Science entered into a strategic collaboration for multiple projects accessing Codexis’ CodeEvolver®  protein engineering platform technology to fuel therapeutic and nutritional innovation. The partnership includes a Nestlé Health Science option for the global development of Codexis’ novel enzyme, CDX-6114, for the management of phenylketonuria (PKU). Nestlé Health Science has also secured strategic access to the CodeEvolver® technology for the discovery of biotherapeutics for other metabolic disorders and for the development of novel enzymes for medical nutrition and consumer care products.
Tate & Lyle is a global provider of ingredients and solutions to the food, beverage and other industries, with operations in more than 30 locations worldwide. Since 2013, and Tate & Lyle have been working in deep collaboration to develop novel enzymes and efficient processes for the sustainable and economic manufacture of food ingredients. The latest success in this partnership is the commercialization, within only two years of initial concept discussions, of a multi-enzyme process for the production of Tasteva® Stevia Sweetener – a naturally derived sweetener in high demand within the food & beverage industries.
Porton Pharma Solutions  provides custom development and cmanufacturing services to the global drug industry. In 2018, and Porton entered into a strategic collaboration to accelerate the creation and commercialization of new, low-cost sustainable manufacturing processes to supply small molecule pharmaceuticals. The partnership reduces costs by improving yields, eliminating processing steps, enhancing capital productivity and/or minimizing consumption of solvents or energy or downstream waste processing. licenses core elements of its biocatalyst technologies to Porton and provides preferential access to its CodeEvolver® protein engineering platform technology for the creation of new biocatalytic process solutions. In parallel, Porton pledges to utilize the CodeEvolver® technology team and to drive adoption of biocatalyst technologies into its custom contract development and manufacturing offerings.
