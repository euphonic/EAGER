Quality
Qualitätsmanagement bei "Good quality is of crucial importance. There is always room for improvement!"
This position of company founder Ernst still serves as a model for us today.
For our customers, quality means failure-free assembly, satisfied end customers, no product recalls—and thus a strong brand. For MAHLE, quality is a significant factor in our global success. Quality management is fully integrated into all business processes. We have developed an in-house Group standard for quality planning and controlling.
The Quality Improvement Program
Our aim is to supply our customers with “best-in-class” quality. For this reason, we launched the group-wide Quality Improvement Program during the year under review. The program aims to further improve the traceability of causes of defects and thereby increase the effectiveness of both specific solutions and quality assurance overall. This also includes supplier quality.
