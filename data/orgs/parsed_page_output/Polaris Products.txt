WARRIORS
The spirit can be traced back to co-founders Edgar Hetteen, his younger brother Allan and his close friend David Johnson. The hard-working trio started the forerunner of Polaris—Hetteen Hoist & Derrick—in 1945 in tiny Roseau, Minnesota. With World War raging and metal scarce, their skill at repairing farm machinery quickly earned them loyal customers.
But it was their tinkering with a better way to get to remote hunting shacks in deep snow that earned them a place in history: Our co-founders developed an early snowmobile in 1955. To prove the new vehicles weren’t just frivolous toys, Edgar and three friends embarked on a 1,200-mile journey across the Alaskan wilderness to demonstrate the vehicle’s durability. They lugged 900 pounds of provisions on toboggans and endured minus-40 degree temperatures to complete the journey in 12 days.
Their determination paid off. The machines became so popular that began manufacturing 
snowmobiles
 exclusively, which we did for many years before launching into additional product lines that leveraged our strengths in product development, powertrain, manufacturing, distribution and marketing.
Since adding All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs) in 1984, we’ve grown to become a global Powersports leader, providing some of the best-selling brands in the industry, including 
RANGER® utility vehicles
, 
RZR® recreational side-by-sides
, 
Indian Motorcycle®
 and 
GEM® electric vehicles
. More recently we expanded our offerings to include 
commercial vehicles
, 
military vehicles
 and the revolutionary 
Slingshot® 3-wheel moto-roadster
, along with boat offerings from 
Bennington
, 
Godfrey
, 
Hurricane
, and 
Rinker

In addition to offering premium ride and drive experience opportunities through
