History
Our Founders
The spirit can be traced back to co-founders Edgar Hetteen, his younger brother Allan and his close friend David Johnson. The hard-working trio started the forerunner of Polaris—Hetteen Hoist & Derrick—in 1945 in tiny Roseau, Minnesota. With World War raging and metal scarce, their skill at repairing farm machinery quickly earned them loyal customers.
But it was their tinkering with a better way to get remote hunting shacks in deep snow that earned them a place in history: Our co-founders developed an early snowmobile in 1955. To prove the vehicles weren't just frivolous toys, Edgar and three friends embarked on a 1,200-mile journey across the Alaskan wilderness to demonstrate the vehicle's durability. They lugged 900 pounds of provisions on toboggans and endured minus-40 degree temperatures to complete the journey in 21 days.
Their determination paid off. The machines became so popular that began manufacturing 
Snowmobiles
 exclusively, which we did for many years before launching into additional product lines that leveraged our strengths in product development, powertrain, manufacturing, distribution and marketing.
Since adding All-Terrain Vehicles (ATVs) in 1984, we've grown to become a global Powersports leader, providing some of the best-selling brands in the industry, including 
RANGER
®
 utility vehicles
, 
RZR
®
 recreational side-by-sides
, 
Indian Motorcycle
®
, and 
GEM
®
 electric vehicles.
More recently we expanded our offerings to include 
commercial vehicles
, 
military vehicles
 and the revolutionary 
Slingshot
®
 3-wheel roadster
, along with boat offerings from 
Bennington
, 
Godfrey
, 
Hurricane
, and 
Rinker
.
In addition to offering premium ride and drive experience opportunities through 
Adventures
, enhances the riding experience with parts, garments, and accessories, along with a growing aftermarket portfolio that includes 
Transamerican Auto Parts

Corporate Stewardship
Since our founding 64 years ago, has aimed to make a positive impact. We take tremendous pride in helping riders enjoy the outdoors, creating a great place to work, and serving as a valued neighbor across all locations worldwide.
is indelibly linked to the outdoor environment. From the beginning, when our co-founders created a snowmobile to get to their remote hunting shacks more quickly in deep snow, we've been creating vehicles and that help outdoor enthusiasts enjoy their passions.
So we understand the significance of a clean environment for our customers and our business. We're committed to offering emissions-compliant products, reducing waste from our manufacturing operations, and encouraging the environmental awareness of our dealers and customers.
We're also dedicated to long-term investment in the communities where we live and do business. Through the Foundation, we make monetary and product donations in three key areas: Youth Safety, Environment and Trail Preservation, and Community Development. See the 
Foundation page
 for donation and grant requests.

Conflict Minerals Policy
The Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") adopted annual disclosure requirements in connection with the conflict minerals provision of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, requiring publicly traded companies to disclose whether certain minerals necessary to the functionality or production of manufactured or contracted to be manufactured originated in the Democratic Republic of Congo and its nine neighboring countries (the "DRC"). These certain minerals referred to as “conflict minerals” include tantalum (columbite-tantalite), tin (cassiterite), tungsten (wolframite) and gold ("3TGs").
Industries Inc. ("Polaris") supports the humanitarian goal of ending the violence and human rights violations in the DRC, which are believed to have been partially financed by the exploitation and trade of conflict minerals. strives to have a conflict-free supply chain and is committed to working with its suppliers to increase transparency regarding the origin of minerals contained in its products. requires its suppliers to undertake reasonable due diligence with their suppliers to identify whether any of the supplied to contain 3TGs sourced from the and, if so, whether the mines and smelters identified are certified as "conflict free" by an independent third party.
is also committed to complying with all the conflict mineral requirements under the Act and all the rules and regulations issued by the SEC.

Joe Thomas, record-holding offensive tackle with 10,363 consecutive snaps, participated in the 
RANGER
 Country Heroes Hunt because it combined two of his passions: hunting and supporting our nation’s veterans. Throughout his 11-season football career, Thomas would often travel overseas to support our nation’s troops.
“Spending a day in the wilderness with these guys changes you. have a far greater appreciation for the courage and sacrifice of our servicemen and servicewomen. They are on the front lines protecting our values and way of life,” said Thomas. “There are so many causes worthy of our support, but in my mind, none are any more deserving than this program.”
“We couldn’t be more honored to partner with 
RANGER
 and Joe Thomas this Veteran’s Day to kick off our fundraising efforts,” said Ed Fisher, founder of Hunting & Mountain Preserve. “After retiring from 27 years of service, was itching to continue to support our military. My wife and founded to help veterans and thank them for their service. Our goal is to ensure their sacrifices are never forgotten and provide a therapeutic environment for healing with their fellow servicemen and servicewomen. We’re honored to be a part of 
RANGER
 Country and to continue to serve our nation’s veterans.”
Utilizing 
RANGER
 vehicles to get around the 400 acres of property, the Heroes Hunt included nine wounded veterans, representing the Army and Marine Corps branches, who participated in six hunts over three days. received tremendous support from the surrounding community, some of which attended a celebratory welcome event with where the three 
RANGER
 vehicles were donated to kick off the hunt. Browning Arms Company, an American maker of firearms and fishing gear, also supported the hunt by providing gear and shotguns for the warriors to use during their three-day hunt.
“No one understands sacrifice and true grit more than our servicemen and servicewomen,” said Kyle Duea, vice president off-road marketing at Polaris. “This year, as an extension of 
RANGER
 Country, we wanted to honor those men and women who have provided us with the freedoms we all enjoy in this great country. LEEK’s mission to encourage wounded heroes aligns perfectly with the values of 
RANGER
 Country, and we are calling on our owner community to join us in supporting them.”

RZR®
 Factory Racing Sweeps First Place at World Finals
>
Minneapolis, (September 6, 2018)
 – Snow bikers now have more choices of industry-leading Timbersled
®
 ARO
™
 snow bike systems with the introduction of the new Timbersled
®
 ARO
™
 129 LE, which gives riders all the great benefits of the ARO
™
 120 with 12% more flotation.
The Timbersled 120 is widely recognized as the ultimate do-everything snow bike, and the new Timbersled 129 shares many of its features – with a new rail and 129 hyfax, new extended side panels, and a new 129 Traverse Track that is instrumental in the system’s 12% greater flotation.
The Timbersled family offers riders a full line of snow bike systems, with an kit that’s just right for each type of rider. Along with the Timbersled 120 and the new Timbersled 129 LE, there’s the Timbersled 137 for the deepest snow and steepest climbs.
Each Timbersled system features a durable, proven, state of the art platform design, that delivers a true bolt-on design making them the easiest to install and convert. They provide the best handling on- and off-trail, giving riders the ultimate deep snow agility and climbing capabilities along with confidence-inspiring trail handling and cornering.
Key elements of the systems that make them the industry’s best-handling snow bikes include:
1:1 ski-to-track ratio for the most precise cornering and best side-hilling control.
Direct Bolt-On System with no required bike modifications
The Traverse Track for improved trail handling and deep snow lift
High strength aluminum frame to make it Timbersled Tough
The Rear Suspension features an advanced design that mimics the feel of a dirt bike with a track approach angle optimized to improve lift in deep snow. It delivers 30% more front track shock travel and 2” more overall suspension travel than the previous Timbersled
®
 chassis. The exclusive shielded brake system reduces ice buildup and provides improved, consistent on-snow performance.
The system is the easiest to convert because it’s a direct bolt-on system with no bike modifications required. With the bolt-on spindle there’s no need to drill, the brakes are pre-bled, and there’s no air box modification required. Once installed, the direct bolt-on suspension is easy to tune to suit a rider’s preferences.
New 129 Features
The new Timbersled 129 has a new 129” Traverse Track, new longer rails and hyfax, new extended side panels, and a new extended tunnel top that offers expanded cargo space. The new 129 comes in Titanium Matte Metallic and has color-matched features including the bumper, frame standoffs, graphics, rails, suspension arms, QS3 shocks, white ski hoop, and spindle.
The 129 also has the Timbersled Traverse Ski 2.0, which has an aggressive tri-keel shape and ski skags for improved strength, grip, and precise handling. This ski provides better lean angles on hard pack and greater control in deep snow.
Timbersled Tough
Timbersled models have proven their durability in the fiercest competition and in the toughest terrain. Timbersled snow bike systems are the #1 choice of regional and Games champions because of their proven durability.

Community Collaboration Transforms Trails and Ride Practices in New Hampshire
>
Colebrook, (November 15, 2018)
 – Six local organizations are linking arms for the first time to bring change to the North Country trail system, Ride the Wilds, while raising industry standards for motorsport riding nationally. Funding the project, The Foundation has given the newly formed alliance a $100,000 grant, which will go toward the creation and installation of 1,000 new trail signs that will provide directional guidance and promote safe and responsible riding practices throughout the trail system.
“Ride the Wilds is an iconic trail system that provides thousands of miles of trails where riders can create memories, discover adventures and spend time with friends and family,” said Lucy Clark Dougherty, president of the Foundation. “is honored to support this community’s collaborative effort to enhance off-road riding experiences.”
Working together to improve community relations by showcasing a strong collaboration between township, clubs, landowners and state entities, organizations included in the alliance are 
Bear Rock Adventures
, 
Great Northwoods Riders Club
, 
Metallak Club
, 
Millsfield Club
, 
The North Country Chamber of Commerce
 and 
Umbagog Club
. With a focus on improving overall rider education, safety and experience through better signage, expected completion is May 2019.
“The new initiative will improve navigation, decrease improper access and enhance the overall quality of the trail system,” said Corrine Rober, owner of 
Adventures
®
 Certified Outfitter, Bear Rock Adventures and marketing chair for North Country Chamber of Commerce. “Bear Rock is on the front lines when it comes to customer feedback, and one of the most consistent recommendations from our guests is to improve trail signage. With tourism growing in our community, it’s our job to provide these improvements and ongoing education so locals and tourists alike can properly utilize our trails.”
According to New Hampshire’s Office of Strategic Initiatives, data shows tourism is a driving factor of economic growth in Coos County. Largely due to off-roading, Ride the Wilds has been the only economic initiative in the county since 2013. From 2012 to 2017, spending on lodging and meals increased 34 percent annually, which rose to 37 percent during months when off-road trails were open. This added spending helps support local economies through jobs and the generation of additional tax revenue.
In addition to promoting tourism, the alliance has been in direct collaboration with Chris Gamache, the head of the Bureau of Trails for the state, to ensure the signage is also helping reach larger bureau initiatives throughout the trail system.
“The project to improve trail signage, which is one of the most significant areas of improvement needed on the trails, is a tremendously positive initiative, and we look forward to working on these improvements with the local clubs and chambers," said Gamache, chief of the New Hampshire Bureau of Trails.
Communities benefitting from the new signage include Clarksville, N.H.; Colebrook, N.H.; Columbia, N.H.; Dixville Notch, N.H.; Errol, N.H.; Millsfield, N.H.; Pittsburg, N.H.; West Stewartstown, N.H.; Averill, Vt.; Beecher Falls, Vt.; Canaan, Vt.; and Lemington, Vt.
