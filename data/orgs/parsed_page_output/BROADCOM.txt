COMPLIANCE
The elimination of hazardous materials from products is a global initiative, with each region or country imposing its own legislation to eliminate these harmful substances from the environment.
Broadcom's RoCompliance Status can be found 
here
.
The European Union passed the "Restriction on Use of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment," or "RoHS" legislation 2002/95/EC, which became effective July 1, 2006 and RoRecast 2011/65/of 8 June 2011 and its amendment Directive (EU) 2015/863 officially released on 31 March 2015.
People's Republic of China enforced "Management Methods of Controlling Pollution Caused By Electronic Information Products", Ministry of Information Industry order #39 on 1 March 2007, which is revised to Order no 32 that became effective 1 July 2016.
The transition to lead-free products is a complex task that affects all electronics component suppliers and poses many supply chain, handling and reliability challenges. It involves the replacement of materials used in solder finishes and printed circuit board assembly with non-lead-based material.
offers a broad portfolio of RoHS-compliant products.  The use of new non-lead-based processes and materials make them fully compliant with the requirements of the Rodirective. Rigorous testing procedures ensure the performance integrity of Broadcom's portfolio of products; regardless of the materials and processes employed.
For inquiries on product availability or samples please contact or designated distributors.

We use cookies and similar technologies on our website ("Site") so that we can improve your experience for example by recognizing you whenever you visit our Site, providing you personalized information, remembering your marketing and product preferences, and helping you obtain the right information. You can find out more about cookies and similar technologies, how we use them, and how to control them below.   
Your use of our Site or services is subject to our 
Terms of Use
Privacy Statement
How Do We Use Cookies and Other Tracking Mechanisms?
We and our third party service providers use cookies and other tracking mechanisms to track user preferences and to maximize the performance of our Site and services.  We, or third parties on our behalf, may combine this information with personal information we collect from you.
Currently, our systems do not recognize browser “do-not-track” requests.  You may, however, disable certain tracking as discussed in this section (e.g., by disabling cookies); you also may opt-out of targeted advertising by following the instructions in the Third Party Ad Network section.
Cookies.
 Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that are transferred to your computer’s hard drive through your web browsers for record-keeping purposes.  Some cookies allow us to make it easier for you to navigate our Site and services, while others are used to enable a faster log-in process or to allow us to track your activities at our Site and Service. There are two types of cookies: session and persistent cookies.
Session Cookies.
 Session cookies exist only during an online session.  They disappear from your computer when you close your browser or turn off your computer.  We use session cookies to allow our systems to uniquely identify you during a session or while you logged into the Site.  This allows us to process your online transactions and requests and verify your identity, after you have logged in, as you move through our Site.
Persistent Cookies.
  Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you have closed your browser or turned off your computer.  We use persistent cookies to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity.
Disabling Cookies.
  Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can edit your browser options to block them in the future.  The Help portion of the toolbar on most browsers will tell you how to prevent your computer from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive a new cookie, or how to disable cookies altogether.  Visitors to our Site who disable cookies will be able to browse certain areas of the Site, but some features may not function.
Clear GIFs, pixel tags and other technologies.
  Clear GIFs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies.  In contrast to cookies, which are stored on your computer’s hard drive, clear GIFs are embedded invisibly on web pages.  We may use clear GIFs (a.k.a. web beacons, web bugs or pixel tags), in connection with our Site to, among other things, track the activities of Site visitors, help us manage content, and compile statistics about Site usage. We and our third party service providers also use clear GIFs in emails to our customers, to help us measure email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and determine whether our emails are forwarded.
Third Party Analytics.
  We use third party automated devices and applications to evaluate usage of our Site. We also may use other analytic means to help us improve our services, performance, and user experiences.  These applications may use cookies and other tracking technologies to provide their services to us.  We do not share your personal information except on an aggregated basis with these third parties.
How Do You Adjust Browser Cookie Settings? 
Cookies can be managed through functionality built into most web browsers (e.g. Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome). They can be adjusted to notify you of cookie placement requests, ask for permission to accept them, or decline cookies completely. For information on how to adjust your web browser cookie settings, please visit:

How Do We Use Third-Party Ad Networks?
We use third parties such as network advertisers to display advertisements on our Sites, to assist us in displaying advertisements on third party websites, and to evaluate the success of our advertising campaigns.  This enables us and these third parties to deliver ads for products and services in which you might be interested.  Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you.  We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our services, as well as aggregate or non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our Site and users of our service. These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy.
You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks, including those operated by members of the Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) and the Digital Advertising Alliance (“DAA”).
Opting out of one or more member or member networks (many of which will be the same) means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you.  You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing.  Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you change web browsers, your or opt-out may no longer be effective.  For more information regarding this practice by members and members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to opt-out of third-party ad networks operated by and members, please visit their respective websites:

Thoma Bravo to Acquire Veracode Software from Inc.
FRANCISCO
 and 
BURLINGTON, Mass.
, 
Nov. 5, 2018
 /PRNewswire/ -- Thoma Bravo, a leading private equity investment firm, today announced that it has agreed to acquire Veracode, the leading provider in next-generation application security testing (AST), from Inc. for 
$950 million
 in cash. Currently, a division of Inc. Veracode's Saaplatform and integrated solutions help security teams and software developers find and fix security-related defects at all points in the software development lifecycle.  The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2018, subject to usual and customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals. 
This acquisition reinforces Veracode's long history of market leadership and innovation, and the partnership with Thoma Bravo is expected to support Veracode's future operational and product development plans.
With broad language, framework, and testing technology coverage, the Veracode Application Security Platform offers a holistic, scalable way to manage security risk across an entire application portfolio. Leveraging a wide range of security testing and threat mitigation techniques, combined with best practices derived from the most innovative application security programs in enterprises globally, customers are given the keys to transforming how they build and buy software by deeply integrating security into their software development lifecycles and enabling DevSecOps processes. Veracode's Application Security Platform has received consistent industry recognition. 
"Software security is one of the most consequential issues facing companies as they look to compete in the digital economy. We are proud that our Saasecurity platform combines multiple application security testing solutions, helping our customers around the world secure the software powering their companies and enabling them to focus on their core business objectives," said 
Sam King
, current Senior Vice President and General Manager of Veracode, who will become the of Veracode following the close of the transaction. "Partnering with Thoma Bravo, a proven security software investor, is expected to extend our market reach and further fuel our innovation so that we can offer the broadest software security platform and empower us to accelerate growth — all to allow us to transform the way companies achieve their software security goals."
"As long-term investors in cybersecurity software, we are impressed with the speed and quality of innovation at Veracode," said

"In today's digital economy practically every company is turning into a software company through their own digital transformation.  As these companies continue to build complex applications, many of which contain sensitive data, the applications themselves increasingly become the target of more sophisticated and omnipresent cyber-attacks.  As such, applications need to be built with security in mind day one, and we see a significant, growing market opportunity for Veracode's product offerings," said
