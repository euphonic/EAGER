Our Company
Materials science is in our DNA.
The pursuit of our vision has compelled us to align our businesses into a focused, customer-driven company that specializes in materials science. Our in-depth pool of expertise and global scale enable us to deliver insights, innovative products and intelligent solutions to customers all over the world.
Heritage
The story begins in 1935, with just a few spare parts, one very bright idea and a $100 loan. Ray Stanton (“Stan”) Avery, a struggling clerk in Los Angeles, invented a smarter way for stores to price their products, then went on to pioneer the labeling industry. With a few simple materials—primarily used machine parts and a saber saw—Stan created and patented the first self-adhesive, die-cut labeling machine. His practical genius would ultimately yield eighteen patents and establish Adhesives as the company that transformed how brands and businesses deliver information. In 1990, International merged with Manufacturing to become Dennison. Today, we manufacture and distribute labeling and packaging materials in over 50 countries and employ more than 30,000 people. The flexibility and responsiveness afforded by our company's global footprint enables us to service our customers at key points throughout their supply chain. In just over 80 years we have grown from one bright idea into a global that continues to set new standards for quality and innovation in materials science.
What We Do
manufactures and distributes display graphics, labeling and packaging materials, retail graphic embellishments and tags that companies around the world use to engage customers and efficiently manage their inventories. Our products are virtually everywhere you look, providing a crucial thread in the fabric of global commerce.

We sustain Stan Avery's spirit of curiosity through research, invention and development of new materials science products and processes.

Helping communities where employees live and work.
The Foundation advances the causes of education, sustainability and women’s empowerment in the communities where employees live and work and encourages employee engagement with a spirit of invention and innovation, improving the quality of life for the people in their communities.
Education
Grantmaking in education provides funding for educational improvements to elementary, secondary, post-secondary and/or vocational schools; and focuses on (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) or graphic and visual arts educational efforts. These grants direct services to populations who are traditionally underserved because of gender, socioeconomic status or geography.
InvEnt- Spirit of Invention
The goal of the InvEnt Scholarship Program is to recognize and reward invention,innovation and excellence in high‐achieving students studying in the fields of science, engineering and technology at selected higher education institutions in China and India. The Foundation developed the program to encourage students to continue to pursue educational opportunities in these fields after graduation by helping them meet their financial needs during their university attendance, and also by offering training opportunities and engagement with corporate offices. Overall, the program aims to foster the development of talent and human resources, nurture creativity and inspire young people in China and India to engage in the spirit of invention.
Scholars Program
The Scholars Program recognizes the academic achievements and potential of the sons and daughters of company employees and helps them obtain a college education. Since its inception in 1977, the program has supported more than 550 students across the United States in their pursuit of higher education. This scholarship program is administered by Scholarship Management Services, a department of Scholarship America. Sending a child off to college is one of the great moments of a parent’s life, and the Foundation is proud to support such moments.
Sustainability
Grantmaking in sustainability provides direct support for projects that conserve the natural environment and contribute to the social, environmental and economic well-being of communities.
The Rainforest Alliance
The Foundation announced a $600,000 grant to the  Rainforest Alliance  to foster best practices in forestry management, create jobs and increase access to sustainably-managed forest products in Honduras. The Rainforest Alliance works to curb deforestation in Honduras and throughout the world by providing farmers and forest managers with sustainable alternatives to forest destruction.
Women's Empowerment
Grantmaking in women’s empowerment provides direct support for projects that address gender equality, equity and opportunities in communities.
Business for Social Responsibility
The Foundation has supported Business for Social Responsibility’s HERHealth initiative in India to empower low-income women working in global supply chains through workplace-based programs.
World Memon Organization
The Foundation has supported the World Memon Organization’s Pakistan Chapter to purchase equipment and train women in sewing and embroidery at the commercial and domestic level to earn income.
Apply for a Grant
The Foundation supports non-profit and non-governmental organizations in markets where our employees live and work. Regardless of geography, all the grants we award will extend our strategic giving in support of education, sustainability and women’s empowerment. The Foundation accepts grant requests year round and makes funding decisions on a quarterly basis.
Employees in the Community
employees around the world volunteer their time and talents to address social and material needs in their communities.
Community Investment Teams (CITs) are groups of employees with the interest in making a positive difference in our local community. We have over 50 CITs globally, made up of employee volunteers who facilitate engagement and volunteerism to help improve the communities surrounding our facilities.
Encouraging community involvement. Inspiring human promise. The Model Integrity and Social Responsibility Leadership Excellence Award was created by the Foundation to recognize and encourage volunteer community service by employees worldwide. This award was created in honor of former Chairman, President and CEO, Russell Smith, who was actively committed to community service. By advancing Dennison's values and leadership principles, the recipients of this award exemplify the Foundation's vision of inspiring human promise to create a more intelligent and sustainable world.
Global Grant Spotlight: Project Hope Schools
The Foundation works in cooperation with  The China Youth Development Foundation’s  Project Hope Initiative to fund and support education in poverty stricken areas of China. Currently, we support/fund 3 schools throughout China.  We share China Youth Development Foundation’s belief that supporting rural children’s access to quality elementary education will positively impact not only their lives, but also the entire community. Rebuilding rural schools represents a meaningful contribution that our company and employees make in China.
Alicia Procello
Welcome to the the Foundation.
Carrying on the spirit of community established by founder Stan Avery, the Foundation represents the values of employees around the world. We focus our giving mainly on education, environmental sustainability, and women’s empowerment.
Our giving touches people across the globe. In my travels for the Foundation, have seen the power of our grantmaking in the faces of children in rural China as they celebrated the opening of a new school; in the hard work and tenacity of communities producing sustainable wood products in remote Honduras; and in the clever inventions designed by future engineers in India.

Open eyes and a helping hand inspire
Anne Hill, SVP/CHRO, to support
The Lily Project
October 26, 2018
“Access to medical care and information is what will make the difference to these women. That’s what The Lily Project provides.”
When asked what community means to her, Anne Hill , senior vice president and chief human resources officer, told us, “It’s reaching out. It’s extending the hand of friendship and help, and sharing what one has learned and experienced with those who haven’t had the same advantages.”
“Our lives can be so insular,” she added, referring to work, home, family and other responsibilities. “You can tend to think that all you see is all there is.”
That thought, Anne says, applies equally to people in need. “So many people around the world live in limited circumstances, where they cannot see a path forward. Their lives become insular as well, thinking the life they experience today is all that there is for them.”
Expanding opportunities for people in need is a cornerstone of community for Anne. That’s why she supports The Lily Project , an organization dedicated to educating women in Nicaragua about health care, self care, and empowerment. “Nicaragua has the highest rate of cervical cancer in the Americas,” Anne explains. “Yet it’s one of the easiest cancers to detect early and treat.” Anne’s eyes were opened to this fact by Susan Cotton, co-founder and board chair of The Lily Project.
“Sue and were ‘parenting friends’,” Anne explains. “She was a corporate executive who decided to follow her passion for nonprofit work. Through her, learned about the high rates of cervical cancer among Nicaraguan women and how simple screenings and preventive care can be when made accessible. The Lily Project calls attention to the fact that ‘when you lose a mother, you lose a family’.”
The Lily Project’s core mission, to provide mobile health clinics that provide cancer screening and pre-cancer treatment, is inspired by Co-Founder Anielka Medina's experience. Her mother, Lily, lived a life typical of women in rural Nicaragua: raising 7 children on her own by age 25. Lily passed away at age 48 after a lengthy battle with cervical cancer. The mobile health clinics, deployed four days per week, not only provide cancer screenings and on-site pre-cancer treatment, but also offer reproductive health classes and opportunities for local women to gather and focus on themselves, an opportunity not often available to them.
“Access to health care and self care information is so limited for most women in Nicaragua,” Sue explains. “Many believe their regular menstrual cycle is a disease. They’ve never been told how their bodies function. Many of them are having children in their early teens, so exposure to (a virus linked to cervical cancer) starts very young.” The women can be hesitant at first, Sue adds, “but all it takes is one. One woman to participate and tell other women. Often, we’ll see 20 women on the first day and 200 on the next.”
Screening and pre-cancer treatment involves two simple tests. When detection and treatment are this easy, Sue says, there’s no reason for cervical cancer rates to be as high as they are in Nicaragua. “Access to medical care and information is what will make the difference to these women. That’s what The Lily Project provides.”
Seeing skills in a different context
Witnessing Sue’s transformation from corporate executive to nonprofit leader made an impression on Anne. “was impressed by how Sue was able to transfer her skills from one arena to another,” Anne recalls. “think people learn to really value their skills when they see them in action in a different context,” Anne says. “Many of us may not be able to be out in the field like Sue,” Anne adds, “but we can shine a light where there’s a need and call attention to it. Sue’s experience proves that one person can make a difference. We all need to remember that.”

Supporting the Foundation at the Spirit of Invention (InvEnt) Scholarship award ceremony in India
Talar Shahinian, Global Corporate Communications Specialist, October 26, 2018
Next stop, India.
Working for a dynamic company like means no two days are ever the same. From implementing strategic social media campaigns to cultivating an actively engaged digital community, there are many exciting aspects to my job. One of my favorites is undoubtedly the opportunity to work with our talented leaders and employees across our business units and geographic regions. If you haven't visited our social media profiles or corporate blog (you should!), these are the platforms the Corporate Communications team and use to showcase the great work taking place across our company.
One of these highlights took place this summer during the Foundation's Spirit of Invention (InvEnt) Scholarship award ceremony. flew to New Delhi, India to work alongside the Foundation team and our colleagues in Gurgaon to promote the event and winners, and even do a little sightseeing.
Smile Foundation
Our colleagues in Gurgaon, India organized a volunteer event with Smile Foundation of India before we attended the festivities leading up to the InvEnt Scholarship award ceremony. The Smile Foundation of India is an that supports thousands of children and their families every year through education, healthcare and women’s empowerment. Driving through Old Gurgaon over unpaved roads, was struck by the signs of extreme poverty in the community.
We met with the women and children of the village at a modest community center. The India team organized activities for us to engage with those at the center. The day started with a play written by the women, followed by a forum where young girls made affirmations with women’s empowerment statements and, finally, an arts-and-crafts activity where the women made useful household items out of the materials they were given (newspaper, tape, sticks). We were encouraged to talk with the women throughout the day, asking questions and providing feedback during the activities. This experience was an opportunity to see the positive outcome of our Foundation’s continuous support of Smile Foundation’s mission. The girls of this community now receive proper health education, and the women can feel more empowered by learning how to be independent and taking skill-building workshops, like sewing.
InvEnt Scholarship Winners
The Foundation Spirit of Invention (InvEnt) Scholarship recognizes and rewards invention, innovation and excellence in students studying in the fields of science, engineering and technology at select higher education institutions in India. In collaboration with the Institute of International Education (IIE), the Foundation selected this year’s 10 winners from an outstanding 85 applications. We were also very pleased to see a larger number of female applicants compared to previous years.
Before being formally congratulated at the InvEnt Scholarship Program Ceremony, the winning students participated in skill-building workshops (including a social media presentation from me!) and toured our facilities in Gurgaon. On the day of the award ceremony, employees from India, as well as leaders from the Asia Pacific region, joined the Foundation in recognizing these 10 bright and talented students for their innovations. It was a rewarding experience not only to cover the event for social media, but also to meet and network face-to-face with my colleagues from different parts of the world.
Little Adventure
After a full week of battling jet lag, heavy rains, flooding in the cities and nonstop events, it was time to get a small taste of India before headed home. Over the weekend, visited Agra, home to one of the Seven Wonders of the World, the Taj Mahal. It was a beautiful day and the grandeur of the ivory-white marble structure was truly breathtaking. Commissioned by Shah Jahan in 1631, the Taj Mahal was built as a mausoleum in the memory of his favorite wife. It leaves a lasting impression on all its visitors.
India was a memorable experience not only seeing a new place but also meeting colleagues and learning more about our Foundation’s grantmaking process. The best part about my job is that no two days are the same and I’m able to collaborate with others to tell our company’s story.
