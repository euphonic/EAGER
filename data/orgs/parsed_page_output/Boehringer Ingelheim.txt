becomes an official partner to CatCareforLife
The CatCareforLife program is a new worldwide initiative set up by the Society of Feline Medicine
It aims to encourage cat owners to work with their veterinary clinics to maintain cats in the peak of health through all their life stages
is committed to further improving the health and well-being of cats and helping educate veterinarians and cat owners
Ingelheim, Germany, 7 November 2018 - is proud to announce its new partnership with the CatCareforLife  program. The program was set up in April 2018 by the Society of Feline Medicine (ISFM), the veterinary division of the UK-based charity Cat Care (ICC). Both and share a common commitment in providing support for veterinarians and cat owners alike to ensure cats enjoy longer, happier and healthier lives, through an effective and tailored preventive healthcare approach.
The CatCareforLife program sits alongside the Cat Friendly Clinic program which offers internationally-recognized standards to help reduce stress of cats during veterinary visits. It is a lifelong partnership of care between cat owners and veterinary clinics through all life stages, from kittens through to old age.
The program provides a full set of recommendations established by experts and organizations to support, educate, and raise the level of care for feline patients.
Three levels in prevention should be considered for a comprehensive approach:
Primary prevention consists in avoiding the development of diseases; this could be achieved thanks to vaccination or antiparasitic treatments.
Secondary prevention regards the early detection of a disease and how its progression could be delayed and/or stopped.
Finally, tertiary prevention concerns the reduction of the impact of an established disease, for instance by managing its complications.
Secondary and tertiary measures become more critical as the cat ages and as diseases become more prevalent. Both the cat owner and the veterinary team need to be aware of the importance of such preventive program, especially as cats often do not show signs of disease. Cats are masters for masking symptoms, thereby regular vet examinations are all the more important for this species.
Shawn Hooker, Head of Strategic Business Unit Pet Vet at Ingelheim, shared: “We are passionate about the lifelong well-being of cats, and are proud to support the CatCareforLife program. We share a common goal with to ensure that all cats receive optimal veterinary care throughout their lives, with regular, stress-free health checks and preventive healthcare, and with early diagnosis and treatment of disease. This is the best way of protecting the health of the cat and preserving the human-animal bond.”
Through this partnership, will actively promote this world-wide initiative and develop practical and informational tools and services to enhance veterinarians’ and cat owners’ knowledge.
Improving the health and quality of life of patients is the goal of the research-driven pharmaceutical company Ingelheim. The focus in doing so is on diseases for which no satisfactory treatment option exists to date. The company therefore concentrates on developing innovative therapies that can extend patients’ lives.

partners with Ipsos to gain insights on human-animal bond in Europe
The human-animal bond survey assigned to the global Research Institute Ipsos took place in 2017 in five European countries, targeting 3,000 pet owners
The survey results show a strong positive impact of pet relationship on owners' well-being
Veterinarians prove to be the contact of choice to provide information on the topic
Ingelheim, Germany, 22 November 2018 – partnered with the Ipsos Research Institute to carry out a survey to explore the human-animal bond and the role it plays on owners’ wellbeing. The survey was conducted in five European countries (France, the UK, Germany, Italy and Spain).
The human-animal bond topic is emerging more and more frequently in human health as pets are taking growing space in our lives. The benefit of the connection starts to be recognised by health care professionals, especially in case of children suffering from health issues. Recent studies also show the positive effects of a patient-animal connection on depressive disorders, cardiac health or post-traumatic stress.
Overall, the results of the survey highlight a strong emotional bond between owners and pets, being even stronger and more intimate among owners with health issues. majority of respondents are conscious of the human-animal bond and aware of the related mutual benefits. Veterinarians prove to be the contact of choice to provide information on the topic.
Main conclusions from the survey are the following:
96 per cent of dog owners and 91 per cent of cat owners declare that owning pets has a positive impact on their daily life, 66 per cent consider them as family members.
For 55 per cent of respondents, who mention that their pet improves their state of health, the pet brings more relaxation to into their life and for 43 per cent it helps increasing physical exercise.
The decrease of medicine (relaxant, depressant, sedative) is part of the concrete improvement linked to the pet ownership (~7 per cent of the sample).
Owners with a condition spend more time and are more emotionally engaged with their pet – unconditional love and trust is what 80 per cent of them strongly agreewhile talking about their affective state with their pet.
Respondents having children suffering from severe or chronic disease are most aware of the human-animal bond than the two other groups.
Overall, 70 per cent of respondents are favorable about vet talking about the topic.
Survey background
The survey was assigned by to the global Research Institute Ipsos in September 2017, targeting three groups: healthy owners, owners with health issues and owners with kids suffering from health issues.
The first part of the study consisted in an in-depth qualitative survey among pet owners to understand their day to day relation and the special bonds between them. The second part targeted 3,000 owners (300 cat owners and 300 dog owners in each country) in order to quantify the relationship and the related benefits for each of them.
View the  key highlights from the study.
