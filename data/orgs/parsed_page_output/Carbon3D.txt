Who We Are
Carbon works at the intersection of hardware, software, and molecular science. Our vision is a future fabricated with light, where traceable, final-quality parts are produced at scale with technology. — Continuous Liquid Interface Production — makes this vision possible by combining engineering­-grade materials with exceptional resolution and surface finish.
Harnessing light and oxygen to produce objects from a pool of resin, is a photochemical process that eliminates the shortcomings of conventional 3printing by harnessing light and oxygen to rapidly produce objects from a pool of resin. From everyday products like tennis shoes and electronics, to industrial components, to highly customizable medical devices, makes it possible for creators to design the parts and products of the future.
