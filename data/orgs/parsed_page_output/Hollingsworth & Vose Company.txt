history of technology, a vision of innovation
The General Court of the Province of Massachusetts Bay grants a ten year, exclusive patent to a group including Benjamin Faneuil and Thomas Hancock (John Hancock's uncle) to manufacture paper in the Province.  Production was begun on the Neponset River and has continued in several mills along this river to this day.
Mark Hollingsworth, a papermaker and a Quaker from Delaware joined the firm.
Mark forms a partnership with Edmund Tileston, also a Quaker.  They purchase the mill and continue the business, eventually buying several other mills on the Neponset.
Mark mortgages his home and purchases the Revere copper works in Braintree, Massachusetts from the Paul Revere family.  With sons, John Mark and Lyman they begin producing paper, mainly using the cotton fiber of used sails purchased from the port of Boston.
During a severe economic downturn, when they could not afford to buy used sails, they try making paper from used rope.  After many trials, John Mark and Lyman succeed and gained the original patent on Manila paper.
Lyman purchases the West Groton, Massachusetts mill.
Manilla paper becomes a preferred insulation material for electrical wiring.
Zachery Hollingsworth, nephew of Lyman and John Mark, buys the East Walpole, Massachusetts mill from Francis Bird
