            - Conference Call Today at
(Nasdaq: LIFE), a biotherapeutics company engaged in the discovery and development of innovative medicines based on novel immunological pathways, today announced operating results for the third quarter ended
September 30, 2018
.
“We continue to advance the development of our lead product candidate, ATYR1923, and have selected pulmonary sarcoidosis as the indication for our upcoming proof-of-concept clinical study,” said
Sanjay Shukla
, M.D., M.S., President and of aTyr. “As previously stated, we are utilizing our ATYR1923 Phase data, along with recent translational research results as well as input from key opinion leaders, to guide our development plan and we believe we are on track to initiate our Phase 1b/2a study of ATYR1923 during the fourth quarter of 2018.” 
Clinical Highlights & Upcoming Milestones
October 2018
, held an educational webinar announcing the selection of pulmonary sarcoidosis as the disease indication for its upcoming ATYR1923 clinical study.  The webinar was led by Dr.
Daniel Culver
, D.O., Director of the Interstitial Lung Disease Program at the Cleveland Clinic, President-elect of the World Association of Sarcoidosis and Other Granulomatous Disorders and the Chair of the Scientific Advisory Board for the Foundation for Sarcoidosis Research.
Pulmonary sarcoidosis is a major form of interstitial lung disease (ILD) a group of immune-mediated disorders which cause progressive fibrosis of lung tissue. 
In the fourth quarter of 2018, plans to initiate a proof-of-concept Phase 1b/2a multiple-ascending dose, placebo-controlled, first-in-patient study with ATYR1923 for the treatment of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. 
-- The study has been designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, steroid-sparing effect, immunogenicity and pharmokinetic (PK) profile of multiple doses of ATYR1923. 
-- In addition, intends to evaluate well-established clinical endpoints and certain biomarkers to assess preliminary efficacy of ATYR1923.
“We are excited to begin our Phase 1b/2a clinical trial for ATYR1923,” said Dr. Shukla. “As previously announced, we have evidence of efficacy of ATYR1923 in animal models which supports the clinical development in pulmonary sarcoidosis and potentially other interstitial lung disease indications.”
Research Highlights
2018 Meeting in
, California.  The presentation was entitled “Bi-allelic mutations in Phe-tsynthetase identified from four families are associated with a multi-system disease and support ex-translational function”.
-- The presentation highlighted a new class of mutations in Phe-tsynthetase (FARS) which do not affect protein synthesis, but are associated with multi-system disease, particularly in the lung and brain, with common features of hypotonia and interstitial lung disease with cholesterol pneumonitis.

About ATYR1923
scientists successfully engineered ATYR1923, a fusion protein comprised of the immuno-modulatory domain of histidyl tsynthetase (HARS) fused to the region of a human antibody.  is developing ATYR1923 as a potential therapeutic for patients with interstitial lung diseases.  announced data from a first-in-human Phase 1 clinical trial of ATYR1923 in June 2018.  This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of intravenous ATYR1923 in 36 healthy volunteers.  The results indicate that the drug was generally well-tolerated at all dose levels tested with no significant adverse events, and the observed profile supports the potential for a once-monthly dosing regimen.
About Pulmonary Sarcoidosis
Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease characterized by the formation of granulomas, clumps of inflammatory cells, in one or more organs in the body.  Sarcoidosis affects people of all ages, but typically presents before the age of 50 years, with the incidence peaking at 20 to 39 years.  The disorder usually begins in the lungs, skin or lymph nodes, but can affect almost any organ.  Sarcoidosis in the lungs is called pulmonary sarcoidosis and 90% or more of patients with sarcoidosis have lung involvement.  Pulmonary sarcoidosis is a major form of interstitial lung disease (ILD) a group of immune-mediated disorders which cause progressive fibrosis of lung tissue.  Estimates of prevalence vary; however, believes that approximately 200,000 Americans live with pulmonary sarcoidosis.  The prognosis for patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis ranges from benign and self-limiting to chronic, debilitating disease with mortality.
