Midterm Corporate Strategy 2021
Midterm Corporate Strategy 2021
has conceived its latest management plan, entitled “Midterm Corporate Strategy 2021: Achieving Growth Through Business Management Model.” It will take effect from fiscal year 2019.
The new strategy will lay the groundwork for MC's sustainable growth over the next three years, recognizing how worldwide economic and geopolitical trends are putting pressure on enterprises to evolve their business models. Such trends include the administration's America-First agenda, China' One-Belt, One-Road policy and the so-called “Fourth Industrial Revolution,” the hallmarks of which are advancing digital technologies and the evolution of platform businesses.

In 1968, the company committed to a large project in Brunei to develop (liquefied natural gas). This was its first large-scale investment. Not content with mere trade-based activities, the company began expanding its development and investment-based businesses on a global scale, as evidenced by iron-ore and metallurgical coal projects in Australia and Canada, and salt field business in Mexico. In 1971, the company made “Corporation” its official English name.

Message from President and CEO
Message from President and CEO
Dear Stakeholder,
am pleased to report Corporation's (MC) latest midterm management plan, “Midterm Corporate Strategy 2021 -Achieving Growth Through Business Management Model-” , taking effect from fiscal year 2019 for the next 3 years.
Societal and economic circumstances are changing rapidly due to developments, such as the geopolitical shift between the and China, and the rise of the “Fourth Industrial Revolution” through digital technology trends and the evolution of platformers.
In response, we will take full advantage of MC's unique collective capabilities to optimize and adapt its portfolio to the changing times. We are constantly questioning in which sectors to strengthen our presence and in which to apply our expertise to develop future Core Businesses. We are fully committed to creating the optimum business portfolio at any given time.
MC's strengths are the collective capabilities to enable its holistic view across all industries, its expertise in conceiving new businesses and its depth of management talent to run them. We will leverage those capabilities to identify Potential Growth Sources, nurture them into Growth Drivers and ultimately establish them as next-generation Core Businesses. When we are no longer capable of adding value to a business, we will redirect capital to businesses where we can add value.
In order to achieve this, we will reform our system for the first time in some 20 years. The new system will ensure that our employees gain the right experience earlier in their careers to develop into management professionals, become more meritocratic to guarantee the right people are in the right positions, and optimize our talent deployment throughout the Group. Those steps will be carried out in parallel to appropriate reorganizations that will better equip us to deal with changes in our operating environment.
True to MC's guiding philosophy, the Three Corporate Principles, we will do our best to continue meeting the expectations of our many stakeholders, growing our businesses in such a way as to simultaneously generate economic, societal and environmental value.
We thank you for your support and look forward to working together for an even brighter future.
November 2018

Philosophy and Principles
Philosophy and Principles
Contributing to Society through Business Firmly Rooted in Principles of Integrity and Fairness
The Three Corporate Principles - Corporate Responsibility to Society; Integrity and Fairness; and Global Understanding Through Business - have served as Corporation's core philosophy since the company’s inception, inspiring us to continually improve the way we address our economic, environmental, and social responsibilities around the world.
Building upon the foundation of these Three Corporate Principles, our 
Corporate Standards of Conduct
 establish the Company's expectations with regard to how business should be conducted, while the 
Code of Conduct
 provides guidance to our employees worldwide based on local laws and global standards such as the 
Universal Declaration of Human Rights
 and 
the Core Labor Standards.
Furthermore, our 
Environmental Charter
 and 
Social Charter
 also provide further guidance in relation to our sustainable business endeavors.
The Three Corporate Principles
The Three Corporate Principles are the foundation of the vision and strategy for our commitment to corporate social responsibility.
Strive to enrich society, both materially and spiritually, while contributing towards the preservation of the global environment.
Maintain principles of transparency and openness, conducting business with integrity and fairness.
Expand business, based on an all-encompassing global perspective.
(The modern day interpretation of the Three Corporate Principles, as agreed on at the Kinyokai meeting of the companies that constitute the so-called group in January 2001.)

Women in the Workforce Today
Percentage of Women in Management-Level Positions (as of April 1, 2018)
Members of the Board (as of June 30, 2018)
Establishment of Diversity Office (October 1, 2014)
On October 1, 2014, established the “Diversity Office” within its Global Department. This office is dedicated to supporting employees with demanding responsibilities at home, such as child and family care. It is also working on global measures to better engage the talents of employees at overseas offices and subsidiaries.
The Diversity Office will continue its efforts in creating healthy, supportive, and motivating work places, where all employees can demonstrate the full breadth of their expertise.
Balancing Work and Child Care - Ensuring Ongoing Career Development for Women at -
MC's basic concept is to appropriately evaluate employees based on their abilities, performances, and contributions, and to assign the right person in the right place at the right time, regardless of gender.
is dedicated to ensure that working women are not forced to abandon their careers due to life-changing events like marriage and starting a family. systems have been devised based on the understanding that personal and family time constraints can differ greatly from one employee to the next. continues to further improve these systems and help everyone perform to the best of their abilities.
Maternity/Paternity and Child Care Systems
Establishment of “Child Care Concierge” within the Global Dept.
To help employees smoothly return to work from Maternity / Paternity Leave, set up a “Child Care Concierge” within its Global Department in April 2015. The Concierge provides employees with information on daycare facilities, babysitters, services for children to continue their studies after regular school hours, and so on. It also provides consultations on children's illnesses and other concerns that employees may have on raising children.
Children's Daycare Facilities & Services
has secured the services of a nearby daycare facility and a sick-child daycare facility so that employees can smoothly return to work. Furthermore, since the summer of 2015, has been providing its “Gakudo” service for elementary school-age children. This is an outsourced service that provides day camps for the children during their schools' long vacation periods.
Establishment of “Paid School Events Leave,” Extension of Flex-time Work Period, and establishment of Telecommuting (Working from Home)
In fiscal year 2015, established a “Paid School Events Leave,” which allows employees to take time off to attend official school and daycare events, such as entrance and graduation ceremonies. also extended the effective period of its staggered work hours and flex-time systems to year six of Japanese elementary school. Furthermore, since fiscal year 2015, has been supporting working mothers and fathers balance work and child care by running a trial of telecommuting (working from home).Telecommuting was officially introduced in fiscal year 2018.
Career Support
offers career support that considers significant life events such as childbirth and child care. provides opportunities for employees who are either currently on Maternity Leave or plan to take it in the near future to learn about MC's relevant systems and policies, as well as to speak with experienced working mothers. These consultations are effective in preparing employees what to expect when returning to work.
Encouraging Workstyle Diversity and Work-Life-Balance
revised its “Child Care Support Handbook” in April 2015 and its “Family Care Support Handbook” in October 2017, and distributed copies to all employees.

Women Overseas
(Russia) LLC
Since 2015, have been in charge of oil and gas development and other energy business operations in Moscow. While Russia has vast hydrocarbon resources and proximity to the Japanese market, Japanese corporations have had only a limited presence in Russia when compared with that in the Middle East and in Southeast Asia. However, our large-scale oil and development project off the coast of Sakhalin Island demonstrated an example of successful engagement, one on which we can build to expand our business operations and presence in Russia. For me, It took a great deal of courage to accept this position and move to Moscow with my children but not doing so would mean missing out on the chance of being involved in bold business creation. With the understanding of my husband working in Japan and the support from my high-school-age children, who themselves have had to overcome difficulties during my assignment; fully took on the mission of uncovering business opportunities and helping turn them into reality. In Japan, as women begin playing a more active role in the workplace, not only must they make various changes to their way of life, so must their families. Many women choose instead to give up career opportunities. But as hear that more and more of our fellow working mothers are taking overseas assignment, am proud to be part of a company that not only has the systems in place to support work-life balance but also supports employees and their families on overseas assignments and where employees have open and progressive mindset.
In January 2017, received “Platinum Kurumin” certification from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. The “Platinum Kurumin” certification is awarded to “Kurumin” certified companies that have executed measures to support employees' child care needs at a higher standard.
At MC, child care benefits include both maternal welfare and child care support. has ensured that its Maternity/Paternity Leave exceeds Japan's minimum legal requirements, and has introduced other measures to help employees returning from Maternity/Paternity Leave to comfortably balance their parenting and work responsibilities. These include flex-time system and shortened and/or staggered work hours. has also made it easier for male employees to take advantage of these benefits, such as by lifting the restriction that previously required employees' spouses to be incapable of providing full-time child care, and by introducing MC's “Paid Childbirth Leave.” Since 2008, has continuously received “Kurumin” certification from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in recognition of these efforts.
In January 2017, received “L-boshi (second level)” certification from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in recognition for its efforts in promoting women's participation and career advancement.
On March 3, 2014, was recognized by Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) and the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) as a “Nadeshiko Brand”, a listed enterprise that is considered “exceptional in encouraging women's success in the workplace.”
【What is the Nadeshiko Brand?】 (Excerpt from METI's website)
The Nadeshiko Brand is an initiative that and the jointly inaugurated in FY2012 for the purpose of selecting and publicizing enterprises that encourage the empowerment of women.
This initiative is one of the Abe administration's efforts for “promoting active participation by women” as “a core of the growth strategy.” endeavors to introduce certain listed enterprises that are outstanding in terms of encouraging women's success in the workplace as attractive stock brands, to investors who put emphasis on improving corporate value in the mid- and long-term, aiming at promoting investment in such enterprises and accelerating efforts encouraging women's success in the workplace.

Timely Information Disclosure in Accordance with the Rules of the TSE
At MC, the executive officer in charge of corporate communications is responsible for the timely information disclosure, and he or she designates the general manager of the Corporate Communications Department to be the person in charge of managing information on a day-to-day basis. The Corporate Communications Department, as the department in charge of timely information disclosure, works to promote awareness regarding the importance of timely disclosure inside the company. At the same time, each department consults with the Corporate Communications Department about any decisions or occurrences that are thought to have bearing on the decisions of investors.

Principles of Human Resources Development
At MC, one of our goals is to develop future management professionals who possess ethics, foresight and execution skills to overcome challenges in any region, industry or era.
We emphasize systematic career path planning and on-the-job-training (OJT) to give each employee experience in several different business fields. We also offer a range of stepwise training programs (OFF-JT).
1. Basic Programs (for Young Employees)
We run training programs for young employees that focus on basic business skills, including management, etiquette, and analytical expertise. These programs are also designed to make our professionals globally competitive, as international experience and skills are vital for anyone who works at a sogo shosha.
Basic Business Skills
All new hires at Tokyo are required to take part in two stepwise programs called the “Basic Business Skills Program (BBS)” and the “Advanced Business Skills Program (ABS)” in their first three years at These programs teach them the basics of finance, accounting, mergers and acquisitions (M&As), business English and global leadership.
Global Competitiveness
Our “Global Trainee Program” provides employees opportunities to train and work overseas early in their careers (typically within their first eight years with the company). The program covers overseas business school assignments, assignments designed to teach employees language and cultural skills, and at offices, subsidiaries and other organizations outside Japan. Every year, sends about 120 young employees on these assignments.
2. Middle Management
As of today, about 2,300 employees are working at overseas offices and Group companies. Middle management training focuses on self development through Our Off-is selective and designed to provide employees with experience that is otherwise difficult to gain in the course of their day-to-day work.
Fostering Future Management Professionals
Every year, we have about 40-50 mid-level managers attend short-term programs at prominent business schools, where they can hone their management skills and build professional networks that span diverse cultures and enterprises.
We have a number of stepwise leadership development programs that cover the approximately 70,000 employees in the Group. Eligible participants can be from MC’s head office, subsidiaries and affiliates, or Group companies. These programs are tailored to help employees perform and think like business leaders, and thus prepare them to potentially run our businesses in the future.
Joint Programs
Program for Global Leaders
Retreat-style training offered by overseas business school professors and other instructors over a total 10 days, to help participants master the management skills necessary to lead their own organization
Program for Leadership Development
Retreat-style training offered over a total of 5 days in collaboration with an overseas business school to help participants acquire business skills as managers
Number of Participants in Joint Programs
3. Senior Management
We have a sophisticated lineup of selective training programs for our senior managers.
High-level Training for Management Professionals
The Executives’ Program was launched in 2003. Participants work in groups to address important challenges to running successful businesses and present their solutions to a panel of executives. The program helps participants from different Business Groups to broaden their perspectives and professional networks by having them work together. It also includes lectures by executives from both and the general business community.
4. Group Values
We are enhancing the collective capabilities of the Group’s some 70,000 professionals by sharing our values and strengthening networks across companies, Business Groups, and countries.
Sharing Our Values
The Group Gateway Program has been held since 2010. An orientation program for employees of offices, subsidiaries and Group companies, it is designed to share MC's corporate principles and values, and to foster greater understanding of the Group. So far, about 3,200 employees have taken part in the program (about 500 per year), which is held eight times a year in Tokyo. It is a bilingual program, with content delivered in both Japanese and English. Similar orientation programs are being held in other regions.
Transfers Across Countries
In recent years, we have been transferring more employees hired at overseas offices and subsidiaries to other countries to meet the growing needs of our global operations. To ensure that transfers go smoothly, we have introduced global relocation guidelines that set forth our basic philosophy on evaluations and working conditions.

New Work Styles Befitting MC
is taking steps to promote new work styles that befit its diversity and unique qualities as a global integrated business enterprise. These steps are designed to ensure that each organization and individual can work in a manner best suited to its needs.
is encouraging employees to take a minimum of 70% of their paid leave and mandating that its overtime-heavy organizations develop more efficient labor-saving practices. In the fiscal year ending March 2017, came very close to achieving those objectives, with employees on average taking 66% of their paid leave and working 24.6 hours of overtime each month.
Employees' Safety and Health Initiatives
Recognizing that its people are its greatest assets, develops and administers its management systems with the utmost attention to employee health and safety. All protocols covering the well-being of MC's employees, labor related issues, and crisis management go above and beyond the legal requirements in Japan. To ensure workplace safety and security, works hard to guard against and assess the circumstances surrounding occupational accidents, analyze their causes, and prevent their reoccurance.
With Group operations growing increasingly diverse, occupational health and safety is a vital component of good business management. Each of MC’s Business Groups is taking measures that are specifically tailored to the nature of its operations and business models.
Employee Health Management
Central to MC's employee health management are medical clinics at its head office and Kansai and Chubu Branch Offices.
The Head Office clinic, which includes its own diagnostic center, is well-equipped to care for the 3,500-plus employees who are based in Tokyo. Its medical departments include internal medicine, ophthalmology, dermatology, otolaryngology, orthopedics, and neurology. The clinic is staffed with approximately 50 full- and part-time medical professionals, including the clinic director, physicians, nurses, technicians, nutritionists, and pharmacists.
[Note] In the fiscal year ending March 2017, approximately 27,000 employees visited the clinic (8,000 for annual health examinations (checkups), 17,500 for regular health examinations, and 1,500 for consultations on overseas medical treatment, insurance, and other health related matters).
In addition, is working with physicians and nutritionists to provide employees with guidance on the prevention of lifestyle-related diseases and obesity.
Once every month, convenes its Health Committee to address employee health and workplace safety matters. The company’s Corporate Functional Officer for Human Resources heads the committee. Its members include two occupational physicians and nine health supervisors.
Health Examinations
Employees at the Head Office are required to undergo annual health examinations at the head office medical clinic. Each employee's checkup takes place during his or her birth month. Other requisite health examinations are performed for new employees when they join the company, and for employees who are either about to embark on an overseas transfer or just returning from one. special health examination is also administered to all employees aged 40 years and over. For all employees who request gynaecological examinations, the company arranges these to be performed at outside clinics. provides detailed health related assistance to its employees, including special health counseling courtesy of the Health Insurance Society. The utmost care is taken in the prevention and early detection of diseases.
is very thorough when it comes to health management, and all employees, including both those based in Japan and overseas must take the annual health examination.
Mental Health
Focusing on preventive measures and early treatment, provides extensive mental care support.
The company has a simple, web-based system through which employees can assess their own stress levels and propensities to develop health problems. This self-check system can help employees to better manage their own health.
Since the fiscal year ending March 2017, has made it a requirement for all employees in Japan, including secondees, to complete the self check. After answering an online survey, employees immediately receive a three-stage evaluation of their stress levels. They are then prompted to provide feedback through the system, or, if their stress levels are particularly high, they are instructed to make an appointment with a neurologist at one of the company’s clinics. If necessary, working environment adjustments are also prescribed to help bring their stress levels down.
Meanwhile, MC's internal help desk and medical clinic neurology department are equipped to quickly accommodate employee health inquiries. has also set up an outside help desk that is linked to its specialized EAP* medical facilities.
Through this comprehensive system, employees and their family members can consult with health-care professionals or receive counseling at any hour of the day, whether in person or by telephone or e-mail.
*= Employee Assistance Program
Health Management of Employees and Their Families During Overseas Appointments
There are approximately 1,200 head-office employees on overseas assignments at any given time, and some 1,500 family members accompanying them. Recognizing that working overseas for extended periods can have an impact on one's health due to differences in language, culture, medical systems, and other environmental factors, has taken several steps to ensure that its employees and their family members remain in good health wherever they happen to be. In addition to facilitating annual local health examinations, the Head Office medical clinic is equipped to handle health-related inquiries from employees and their family members should they feel unwell while overseas. Each employee stationed overseas is required to undergo an annual medical examination. If there is not a suitable medical facility in the area, will provide for the employee to either return to Japan or travel to other nearby developed country for the examination. Employees also qualify for subsidized travel expenses when taking Health Maintenance Leave, which can be taken in addition to paid holidays when employees need time off to refresh themselves, both in mind and body.
also provides a global, 24-hour Japanese language service for medical emergencies, emergency assistance in transporting employees to more medically advanced regions like Tokyo, Singapore and other extensive health-related support for its employees on overseas assignments.
Labor Time Management
The increasing speed and complexity of MC's operations is placing greater demands on the company's workforce, both in terms of quality and quantity. As a global integrated business enterprise, is engaged in fairly diverse operations, including large-scale projects and overseas transactions. During the inevitable busy periods, employees are often forced to concentrate on many different tasks in a short period of time.
To optimize its workforce, prioritizes the following three areas: (1) The physical and mental well-being of its employees; (2) Compliance with laws and regulations; and (3) Reduction of chronic overtime.
MC’s regulations on managing working hours are stricter than the requirements of Japan’s Labor Standards Act, and all officers and employees who work more than a stipulated amount of overtime are issued health surveys and required to see an occupational physician for guidance on managing their health. Employees must also submit accurate records of their overtime hours and abide by Article 36 of the Labor Standards Act (regarding overtime work and work on days off), managers have been attending time management training courses.
The primary role of MC's Time Management Committee is to work with the labor union on an appropriate system of time management. Furthermore, in order to promote “New Work Styles Befitting MC” the committee not only supports the business departments' work-specific initiatives, but also promotes companywide initiatives, such as encouraging employees to systematically take their paid leave and addressing each case of chronic overtime with tailored solutions.
Crisis Management Initiatives
has operations in approximately 90 countries around the world, with a global workforce of roughly 70,000 professionals. The company recognizes the ever-present danger that somewhere in the world, its employees or their families may be the victims of natural disasters, regional conflicts, terrorist attacks, or other incidents.
Accordingly, always tries to prepare for the unexpected. The company has broadly divided crises into four categories, and should anything happen, it is capable of setting up its Crisis Management Headquarters at a moment's notice. The headquarters functions as a hub for gathering relevant information and issuing directives on crisis response. has compiled a manual explaining how to prepare for and what to do in the event of a crisis. It also outlines the company's basic thinking and actions. Simulations and drills are also regularly held to ensure that all employees are prepared.
When the Great East Japan Earthquake struck on March 11, 2011, was quick to set up an emergency task force. All employees were confirmed safe that same evening, and arrangements were made to ensure that those who were unable to return home would be safe for the night. In the days that followed, the task force swiftly set up a flexible work schedule in response to the rolling blackouts, furnished financial assistance to employees affected by the disaster, and provided other support.
has also incorporated crisis and health management sessions in its various training programs. Meanwhile, information is being exchanged at previously mentioned Health Committee. The issues discussed include not only employee healthcare, but also the best ways to learn about emerging infectious diseases and the timely, accurate disclosure of information.
Initiatives on a Consolidated Basis
<Screening Process for Loan and Investment Proposals>
When reviewing and making decisions on loan and investment proposals, not only takes economic factors into consideration, but also places great importance on (Environmental, Social, Governance) criteria. From an perspective, particularly for projects which have a high risk of accidents or fatalities, ensures that numerous issues, including the maintenance status of management systems, past cases of accidents or fatalities, and quantitative data such as the (Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate) are considered in its deliberations. Besides screening new and exit proposals, also strives to help make improvements to existing business investments by monitoring their management practices.
<Reporting Framework>

Compliance
has long engaged in creating a framework to ensure that it continues to conduct proper and fair business activities, in addition to upholding legal and regulatory compliance. This long-standing commitment is based on the Three Corporate Principles, which encapsulate our corporate philosophy, and is stipulated in our Corporate Standards of Conduct.
In September 2000, we formulated a Code of Conduct, and we are obligated to make compliance our top priority and ensuring legal and regulatory compliance by each and every employee, as well as instilling an awareness of proper conduct that reflects social norms.
In another initiative, we introduced the Compliance Officer post and compliance officers have been appointed in all business groups and all regions in Japan and overseas. These people work to foster compliance in daily activities.
Every year starting with the fiscal year ended March 2010, all officers and employees are required to take e-learning courses, which include case studies on the Code of Conduct, and to sign an agreement stating that they understand and will adhere to the rules at all times. These protocols have since been introduced at MC's subsidiaries as well. Furthermore, we conduct various activities such as compliance-related seminars, holding Compliance Discussions to encourage personnel to discuss compliance issues in each work place by using case studies about possible violations in the work place, distributing "Compliance Case Study Q&Booklets" and launching the Global Whistleblowing System so as to instill knowledge and awareness of compliance in each and every officer and employee of and MC's subsidiaries.
Particularly in regard to the Whistleblowing System, is striving for early detection of compliance violations by establishing various contact points, enhancing quality with training for people in charge of contact points, and putting energy into efforts to keep employees informed.

Key Sustainability Issues (Materiality) Themes of Key Importance for MC's Sustainable Growth
Approach to Identifying Our Key Sustainability Issues
Responding to global sustainability issues, including meeting or exceeding the rising expectations of our stakeholders, has an increasing impact on MC's longterm growth year by year. In recognition of this fact, we have stepped up our efforts to simultaneously generate economic value, societal value, and environmental value by pursuing businesses that generate value for societies as part of the vision set forth in Midterm Corporate Strategy 2018. We have identifi ed key issues for MC's sustainable growth as mileposts to help us realize the simultaneous generation of these three kinds of value in a proactive, integrated manner based on the nature of our business as a sogo shosha.
Overview of the Identification Process
Step1Creating a list of potential themes
Based on external guidelines including the International Standards and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)*1, compiled a comprehensive longlist of potential themes that the entire company should take into account in order to achieve long-term, sustainable growth.
Step2Gauging the importance of each theme based on internal and external perspectives
We assigned a weighting to each theme identified in Step 1 based on the potential scale of impact in terms of both opportunities and risks that will influence MC's sustainable growth. The perspectives of MC's groups and business groups (horizontal axis) as well as those of our external stakeholders*2 (vertical axis) were gathered. We then compiled a shortlist of themes that we determined to be highly material from both perspectives.
Discussion with members of the Sustainability Advisory Committee
Step3Determining the Key Sustainability Issues
We reexamined the themes identified as most important in Step 2 while incorporating the views of our external stakeholders, including those of our Sustainability Advisory Committee. Then, after careful consideration by the Board of Directors, the Key Sustainability Issues were finalized.
*1：The Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 set out by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015
*2：Various stakeholders including institutional investors, NGOs and outside experts
We identified seven key sustainability issues with the goal of simultaneously generating the three kinds of value which are essential for to achieve sustainable growth. Through initiatives that address each of these themes, will strive to create businesses that generate value for societies.

With the goal of contributing to the transition to a low-carbon society, will make efforts to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by promoting initiatives such as those detailed below. will also challenge itself by working to develop new, game-changing technologies that significantly reduce emissions, and by building innovative businesses.
Targets
Aim to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions* per total assets** by 25% by 2030.
*Compared to year ended March 2017 levels. Greenhouse gas emissions on a consolidated basis (on a non-consolidated basis plus subsidiaries).
**The total assets used for this target represent the numerical values within the emissions reporting calculation range, which differ from the total assets reported in MC's financial reports.
Aim to achieve at least 20% renewable energy in MC's power generation business (by 2030, based on generation amount).
Examples of initiatives
Promote businesses that support the proliferation of renewable energy, including energy transmission and storage-related businesses.
Use Best Available Technology (BAT) for businesses such as power generation (both and trading of components) to the extent possible.
Promote low-emission natural gas projects.
Managing Risks to MC's Businesses
has integrated environmental and social considerations into its robust risk management process, having established a system to efficiently gather the latest information on policy developments and other relevant details on a global basis. MC's climate change initiatives are also reported regularly to the Board of Directors.
Countries continuing efforts to regulate emissions could have an impact on MC's businesses related to fossil fuels. However, having completed an analysis of the potential impacts associated with a number of different scenarios (including the 2°Scenario*), has determined that the impact to its business in the medium to long term will be limited.
MC's total emissions for its operations on a global, consolidated basis (including power generation) in the year ended March 2018 was 8.14 million tons. has a diverse business portfolio and will continue to implement tailored emission reduction measures appropriate to each sector.

Surveys and Supplier Visits
In order to ensure that the principles outlined in our Policy for Sustainable Supply Chain Management are being upheld in our supply chains, we conduct regular surveys of our suppliers, that operate in higher risk industries such as agriculture and apparel.
In 2018, we conducted our survey and received responses from approximately 350 companies in approximately 30 countries and regions. Respondents answered questions pertaining to matters such as establishment of internal regulations, regulatory and legal compliance; prohibition of forced labor, child labor and discrimination; environmental conservation; and information disclosure.
In addition to the supplier surveys, we also follow up with supplier site visits by employees.
These supplier surveys and site visits provide a valuable opportunity for to communicate our sustainability commitments to our suppliers. We will continue to engage and work in partnership with our suppliers going forward.
Supplier Visits
In the year ended March 2018, our employees visited two suppliers in Vietnam: Viet Tien Garment, a garment factory, and Vinh Hoan Corporation, a company in aquaculture and processing of pangasius. Interviews were conducted with employees and management executives in order to cultivate a better understanding of best practice in each industry.
At the Viet Tien Garment factory, through interviews with management we were able to confirm that sustainability has been integrated into the company’s core strategy. As part of its strategy to improve efficiency, Viet Tien Garment is in the process of setting energy-saving targets and strengthening its occupational health and safety (H&S) standards. In addition to interviews, we visited Viet Tien Garment factory and recognized that an H&manual is distributed to workers and H&signs are clearly posted around the factory to prevent accidents; the factory floors are kept clean at all times to prevent personal injuries, and working hours are managed by a fingerprint authentication system to prevent overtime.

Regular cleaning to prevent accidents
Vinh Hoan also takes a serious approach to sustainability as their management policy. The company has acquired several certifications such as ASC*1 and BAP*2 as part of its efforts to differentiate itself from its competitors. During the site visit, we recognized that hygiene standards were observed properly (including the use of worker uniforms), and also confirmed that its wastewater treatment process is independently verified by a third-party. Although an H&minor issue was identified during the visit, improvement measure was promptly agreed upon and adopted soon after the visit.
*1Aquaculture Stewardship Council: Certification program for sustainable aquaculture.
*2Best Aquaculture Practices: Certification program for safe and sustainable aquaculture.

(c) The need for rights and obligations to be matched to appropriate and effective remedies when breached.
International Labour Standards
The International Labour Organization (ILO) was founded in 1919 on the basic principle that universal and lasting peace can be established only if it is based on social justice. Since its establishment, one of the most important functions of the has been the formulation of international labor standards through Conventions and Recommendations. The has a tripartite structure with workers and employers participating as equal partners with governments. Conventions and Recommendations are adopted at the International Labour Conference of the and ratifying States commit to observing them. The ratifying States also use Recommendations to guide their national policies, lawmaking and actions. Since its founding, the has adopted Conventions and Recommendations that cover nearly every issue affecting the working world. The has identified eight Conventions, which it calls the Fundamental Conventions, pertaining to issues ranging from discrimination and minimum working age to the worst forms of child labor. endorses all eight Fundamental Conventions and makes specific reference to compliance with them in the Code of Conduct.

Supporting Small-scale Coffee Growers in Colombia
Improving coffee quality while conserving the local environment
In Columbia, although oil and coal have recently become the main commodities for production and export, coffee remains to be a key commodity for the country. Columbia ranks third or fourth in total coffee production volume globally, and the industry plays an important role in promoting both development for rural communities and economic growth for the country as a whole.
Since 2008, (MC) has supported small-scale coffee growers ("small growers") in Columbia as an international contributions project through the National Federation of Coffee Growers of Colombia (Spanish: Federacion Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia, "FNC").
* is a non-profit organization that represents about 375,000 Colombian coffee producers and manages production and exports of Colombian coffee. Recently, has decided to purchase coffee beans produced by selected growers in the Department of Norte de Santander, and import and market them in Japan.
Small growers supported by in Colombia export coffee beans to Japan
In May 2015, entered into an agreement to purchase 550 bags (70 kg/bag, total equivalent to approximately 3 million cups of coffee) of higher-quality coffee (product improved through the Forest Ranger Families Program) from 288 growers in Norte de Santander Department where provided support in fiscal 2014. These coffee beans will be imported into Japan around October or November and made available to Japanese consumers. Colombian coffee is specially known for its wonderful aroma.
The Forest Ranger Families Program — Support for Colombia's small growers
Many small growers in Colombia belong to the poorest segment of the population, and small-scale farming has become a hotbed for the production of illegal crops such as cocaine. As part of a national campaign aimed at eradicating illegal crops, former President Uribe and President Santos have been implementing support projects for small growers in coffee growing regions.
is conducting numerous international contribution activities worldwide, each tailored to the needs of the local communities. In Columbia, has been party to a memorandum of understanding to contribute to a support project for small growers through the Forest Ranger Families Program since 2008. is working together with the Administrative Department of the Presidency of the Republic (Spanish: Departamento Administrativo de la Presidencia de la República, "DAPRE"), FNC, local governments and governmental financial institutions to provide a variety of support to small growers such as improving farm technology, providing infrastructure and conserving the environment.

Mozal Aluminum Smelting Project
Aluminum Business and Regional Development
MC's Aluminum Business
Aerial view of the Mozal aluminum smelting facility
Aluminum ingots are produced by taking alumina, which is extracted from mined bauxite by dissolving it in caustic soda, and smelting it through the process of electrolysis. The annual demand for aluminum products in Japan is around 4 million metric tons, and these products are made by processing aluminum ingots through methods such as rolling, extrusion and casting. Aluminum is also a frequently recycled metal, and recycled aluminum ingots can be manufactured vastly efficiently.
MC's aluminum business revolves around two major areas of activity: resources development and trading. The resources development business conducts projects related to bauxite mining, alumina refining and aluminum smelting, and the trading business is involved in the trade of aluminum ingot, aluminum products and recycled aluminum ingots. MC's involvement in the resources development business was originally sparked by the Oil Crises of the 1970s. The smelting process consumes enormous amounts of electricity and at the time, rising electricity prices made it difficult for aluminum smelters to conduct their operations in Japan. presently has aluminum smelting operations in countries including Mozambique, Australia and Brazil. MC's annual volume of aluminum ingot production is approximately 230 thousand metric tons — making it the largest Japanese producer of aluminum — and the company continues to actively secure additional resources.
has trading offices in Singapore, Tokyo, New York, London, Bangkok and Shanghai. The annual trading volume of aluminum ingots is approximately 1.6 million metric tons worldwide including Asia, the United States, and Europe, of which, the trading volume in Japan amounts to approximately 400 thousand metric tons.
Overview of Mozal SA
Mozal was established in 1998 as an aluminum smelting company in Mozanbique as a joint venture among MC, the government of Mozambique, the global mining giant Billiton and the Industrial Development of South Africa,. The government of Mozambique was eager to promote foreign investment projects for revitalizing a domestic economy ravaged by years of civil war. At the time, the government of South Africa which wants economic independence and stability of the neighboring country, had announced that it would supply domestic electric power to Mozambique. With these helpful external factors as well as the strong commitment of the parties involved, Mozal has become a successful aluminum smelting project that has played a major role in Mozambique's reconstruction. Mozal currently produces and exports 560 thousand metric tons of aluminum ingots a year. Today, aluminum smelting industry as a whole is the country’s largest, accounting for 50% of its total exports in value.
Environmental Initiatives
Mozal places utmost importance on the environment. The project has three main environmental initiatives. The first measure is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Generally, electrical power stations are known as a source of greenhouse gas emissions, and Mozal recognizes that it has an important responsibility as a smelter to find long-term solutions to reduce greenhouse gases. The project is working on ways to reduce power consumption as well as other initiatives such as switching the source of fuel for anode baking furnaces from heavy fuel oil to natural gas, a strategy first implemented in fiscal 2005.
Secondly, Mozal is also addressing the need for adequate treatment of waste from spent pot linings. Electrolytic furnaces must be replaced after their useful life of five years, and the toxic waste that results from the smelting process must be adequately treated before disposal. Mozal currently stores half the waste material onsite under strict and proper procedures and disposes the other half of the waste material at a nearby refuse center under government license. For the future, Mozal is investigating methods to reuse this material in new applications that render the waste material non-toxic and is conducting joint experiments with steel and cement manufacturers.
Thirdly, wastewater treatment is also carefully monitored by the company. All water used in the ingot production process is kept in a reservoir located adjacent to the plant. Mozal monitors the water quality on a daily basis to ensure that fluoride and other concentration levels do not exceed the World Bank's criteria. Water must meet these strict criteria before it can be released into the nearby Matola River.
Job Creation, Education and Training
Mozal has generated much-needed local employment, and currently employs 1,250  employees. Furthermore, the project has provided indirect employment opportunities to upwards of 10,000 people including subcontractors and stevedores.
Locally-hired Mozambicans make up more than 95% of the plant's workforce. Although operations at the plant commenced in December 2000, the recruitment began in 1998 with the construction of the plant. Mozal conducts extensive education and job training for all of its employees. This is both in an effort to ensure high product quality as well as to give employees necessary health and safety information. The project endeavors to increase opportunities for employees to discuss these matters, and at the same time has also laid out a smooth reporting system throughout the organizational structure. These initiatives have earned the company a strong reputation for developing skilled employees through its education and training initiatives.
The Mozal Community Development Trust
In August 2000, Mozal established the Mozal Community Development Trust (MCDT).  MCDT’s main areas of focus are supporting small businesses in creating employment opportunities, putting in place mechanisms to support education and public health, and activities in other areas such as sports, culture and infrastructure. Examples include the construction of schools and anti-malaria clinics, as well as the provision of education. also supports local economic activities through the promotion of local agriculture and the commercial sales of local crafts. All projects are regularly reviewed by the Board of MCDT, of which is also a member, to ensure that progress is being made and positive impacts have been generated in the region.
The has spent a total of 30 million dollars since its establishment. intends to continue contributing to the local community through the funding of such activities.

The largest, high-purity silica sand mine in Australia
Coexistence with the Environment and Local Communities
Cape Flattery Silica Mines
Mountains of silica sand stretch out like snow-covered peaks across Cape Flattery, lying approximately 250 km north of Cairns, in Northern Australia. This is the Cape Flattery Mine Site operated by Silica sand is the primary raw material used in making glass products. The silica sand is also used to manufacture solar panels and demand has been soaring as new energy continues to garner increased attention.
Japan-bound silica sand exports from the Site through began in 1968. Cape Flattery Silica Mines Pty., Ltd., established in 1977 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of MC, stably supplies superior quality silica sand under an integrated system that includes mining operations such as extraction and refining, shipping and distribution.
In the late 1980s, we constructed at the Site a large-scale dock, accommodating a large-scale refinery plant and ships of up to 70,000 tons and loading some 20,000 tons of silica sand per day. Currently, about 2 million tons of silica sand annually are shipped from the Site to Japan as well as South Korea, Taiwan, the Philippines and other countries in Asia.
Business that aims to better coexist with local communities and the environment
The Site has confirmed deposits of approximately 200 million tons. At the current production volume, we estimate that there is enough silica sand there for the next 100 years. Therefore, we focus our attention on realizing sustainable resource development placing the surrounding natural environment as top priority.
Some efforts to achieve this involve the rehabilitation of topsoil at the Site to restore vegetation. After extracting silica sand, seeds of plants that grow naturally in that area are sowed into the soil to return the site over a 3 to 4 year period to a mountain of greenery, complete with trees and other natural vegetation.
All of the water that is used to purify silica sand is reused.
We have fostered our business in Australia aiming to better coexist with local communities and the environment for over 40 years.

Contribute in many ways to the realization of a low-carbon society.
Efforts to Promote Renewable Energies
Our societies rely on various energy sources. Of these, wind power and solar power has been looked to as one of the means to reduce global warming because they do not emit carbon dioxide in the process of power generation.
In its efforts in the power generation business, responds to society's demands through using wind, solar photovoltaic, geothermal and other renewable energies alongside conventional thermal power generation.
Diverse Initiatives to Respond to Diverse Needs
In order to respond to diversifying electricity needs, is developing projects under alliances with joint investors possessing technological capabilities or deep regional knowledge. With Tenaska Inc. in the and in Spain, for example, has chosen best-fit partners according to the nature of the project.
In Japan, operates an on-site power generation business. installs power generation plants inside the factory sites of customer companies and uses them to sell and supply electricity and steam. This is a field in which can realize its collective strengths by providing comprehensive contracted services ranging from financing, designing and fuel procurement to maintenance and inspection, based on long-term energy supply agreements with these customers.
In Western Europe, there are high hopes for a new renewable energy source, namely offshore wind power generation on the North Sea coast and west coast. These are seen as locations that can generate large amounts of electricity given the strong winds that blow constantly. This has spawned the need for offshore transmission to carry electricity generated by colossal wind turbines placed offshore to land.
Responding to this need, is the first Japanese company to operate an offshore transmission business in the and Germany. continues to expand this infrastructure business, in which it sees prospects for development worldwide.

Activities at MDP, Owner of One of the World's Largest Coking Coal Mines
Land Rehabilitation at Post-mining Sites
In developing natural resources, companies need to consider environmental impacts to areas such as biodiversity, forests and water. The local community must also be duly engaged as an important stakeholder. ensures that our mining activities in Australia are conducted in harmony with the natural environment and local communities with utmost care and attention, both before and after the mining operations.
Moving into a Resource Business
The coal operation of Billiton Alliance (BMA) locates in Queensland, Australia. It covers an area twice as large as the Republic of Singapore and produce high-quality coal. Over 90% of BMA's total coal output is coking coal for steelmaking. (During steelmaking, coking coal is the raw material for coke which is charged into a blast furnace with iron ore and acts as a reducing agent to produce pig iron). The coal is supplied to consumers in approximately 30 countries around the world, including Japan, China, India, and countries in Europe. is the world's largest seaborne supplier of coking coal, shipping approximately 60 million tons per annum.
established Development Pty Ltd (MDP), the wholly-owned subsidiary, in Australia in 1968 as a resource investment company. Through MDP, we manage mining of coking coal and thermal coal, which is used as fuel in power plants. In 2001, created together with global mining giant Billiton and launched the large-scale coal mining operations in Queensland. This required an investment of approximately ¥100 billion. has taken on both operational risk of such an enormous investment and significant challenge of becoming a full-scale coal mining company as part of our plan to become a key player in the coking coal industry.
Rehabilitation of Large-scale Open-cut Mines
The majority of coal mines are operated by open-cut mining, a method requiring overburden removal to depths of between dozens of meters and over 100 meters in order to reach the underlying coal seams.
Coal mining process in open-cut mines starts with removal of the topsoil. The area where mines are situated is not forested as it has little rainfall, and instead the topsoil is covered with a mixture of grass and scrub. The topsoil of about 30-40cm deep with each type of vegetation is removed and preserved at a separate location. After this process is complete, overburden removal and subsequent coal mining is carried out, leaving behind a large pit. Once all of the coal is mined, the overburden which was moved to an adjacent site during mining operations is returned to the pit, and heavy equipment such as dozers is used to level the ground surface. The surface is then stacked with the stockpiled topsoil and the preserved vegetation together with seeds from the surrounding area. This is called rehabilitation process. This process returns the site to a state similar to that before mining started, although the ground surface elevation is lower by an amount equivalent to the coal removed from the site.

Sufficient water and fertilizer are supplied to the stockpiled topsoil so that the vegetation is not blasted. After rehabilitation, site recovery is monitored to confirm whether vegetation is taking root and whether animals are returning to the area. employs ecological specialists for the planning, rehabilitation, and surveying stages to facilitate the entire process.
Focus on Health, Safety, Environment and Community
In the mining business, one of the most important issues for management is efforts related to (Health, Safety, Environment, and Community). One example of BMA's key initiatives is the sustainable use of water, given the amount of water required for the mining process.
significant amount of water is required for mining operations. The water used to wash coal is channeled into reservoirs called tailing ponds, where the impurities in the water gradually sink to the bottom over years. During this time, the tailing ponds are monitored in accordance with strict environmental regulations until clear water rises to the surface. The water quality is once again checked before the water can be reused for rehabilitation programs or for washing coal. Rainwater and groundwater are also collected in coal mines at multiple sites, and these are used to prevent dust from dispersing as well as to water vegetation. As a matter of course, the safety of employees is also an important factor in mining operations. To date, has won a number of awards related to including the "National Minerals Industry Excellence Awards for Safety and Health".

vol.19 Hisaya's Passion for Papermaking and Farm Management
vol.19 Hisaya's Passion for Papermaking and Farm Management
We highlight episodes related to the papermaking business and Koiwai Farm, two ventures that Hisaya Iwasaki, Mitsubishi's third president, took a strong interest in.
During the two decades he served as Mitsubishi's president, Hisaya presided over a broad expansion of the company's business, largely centered on mining and shipbuilding operations. This coincided with a period in which Japan made great strides in establishing itself as a modern nation. One business that Hisaya took a special interest in was papermaking.
Hisaya purchased the papermaking business of the Walsh Brothers and established the Kobe Paper Mill in 1898 after Thomas Walsh decided to leave Japan following the death of his brother. The Walsh Brothers were American entrepreneurs with whom Hisaya's father, Yataro, had maintained close ties ever since his early days in business in Nagasaki. It was with the help of the Walsh Brothers that Hisaya's uncle, Yanosuke, was able to travel to the to study in the early 1870s.
After changing its name to Paper Mills in 1904, the company built a new factory in Tokyo and established operations in Shanghai. The papermaking business had originally been managed under the umbrella, but it was transferred to the Iwasaki family when Hisaya stepped down as president. Hisaya remained personally involved in managing the company, which was incorporated in 1917.
Meanwhile, in Iwate Prefecture in northeastern Japan, a different business was taking root. The venture was launched in 1891 by three men who shared the dream of establishing a farm that employed western agricultural methods. The name of the venture, Koiwai (
) Farm, was formed by combining characters from the names of its founders: Japan Railway Vice President Gishin Ono (
; the in Ono is also read Ko); Mitsubishi's second president, Yanosuke Iwasaki (
); and Railways Minister Masaru Inoue (
). Hisaya became in charge of the farm's management in 1899.
Hisaya saw stockbreeding as being central to the farm's operations. He imported thoroughbreds from England and focused on breeding stallions and racehorses. He imported dairy cattle, such as Holsteins, while introducing new production techniques for dairy products such as milk and butter. The farm also grew oats, corn, potatoes, soy beans and other crops while steadily working to promote afforestation. Through years of sustained efforts, the farm transformed what had once been untamed wilderness into a great expanse of verdant forests and fields.
Hisaya stayed at the farm with his family every summer. He took joy in seeing the children who lived on the farm and how the livestock had grown. Late in his life, Hisaya spent time at Suehiro Farm near Narita, where he was frequently reminded of Koiwai Farm, which always retained a special place in his heart.

vol.1 Yataro’s Values Shaped by Stalwart Mother
In Our Roots, we will examine the earliest origins of values that continue to shape and guide our activities today. In this first installment, we focus on Miwa Iwasaki, the mother of Founder Yataro Iwasaki. Miwa greatly influenced Yataro and also laid out a set of precepts for the Iwasaki Family to live by.
Miwa was the daughter of a doctor, but her father passed away when she was only 13, so she went to work in the household of a retainer of the local feudal lord. Miwa then lost her mother at 15 and subsequently married a low-ranking samurai by the name of Yaziro Iwasaki at the age of 16.
Life was certainly not easy for Miwa, but one year, a neighborhood woman came to her in tears, seeking money. Miwa had long been frustrated by the woman’s weak character, so she firmly refused; however, upon seeing the woman wearily trudge homeward, she ran ahead of her and secretly slipped what little money she had into the woman’s house. Miwa was a considerate person, and even after Yataro achieved success in business, she remained a pillar of the Iwasaki Family.
Miwa established the following precepts for the Iwasaki Family:
1. Do not stray from the straight and narrow way.
2. Do not cause children hardship.
3. Do not heed the slanderous comments of others.
4. Cherish and protect the family.
5. Do not become complacent when you are in good health.
6. Do not forget what it is like to be poor.
7. Always have a patient heart.
It must have been sobering for Yataro, who was said to be arrogant on occasion, to recall these words of his mother.
In February, newspapers in Japan reported that a company employee in Kochi Prefecture made an interesting discovery near the house where Yataro was born in Aki City. The man found what is believed to be a jar used by Miwa to frugally stash away meager savings back in the days when the Iwasaki Family was on the brink of poverty. The jar, which contained nearly 180 Edo-period coins, will be displayed along with other Iwasaki Family heirlooms at the Aki City Museum of History and Folklore until January 30, 2011.

Since 1954 vol.5 Push to Modernize Management Systems Reflects Focus on Future Business Growth Development of Data Processing Capabilities & Expansion of Telecommunications
We continue to look back on the tenure of President Kiyohiko Sho while highlighting the company's pioneering efforts to modernize management.
In 1963, Shoji became the first Japanese company to record sales1 of 1 trillion yen. The scope of the company's operations had expanded dramatically, and at the same time, the number of employees rose sharply, from approximately 4,500 in 1960 to more than 7,700 in 1966. As a consequence, the volume of office work also ballooned. With its sights set on even further business expansion, the company resolved to move ahead with an unprecedented push to modernize management. This included efforts to improve the efficiency of office operations through the introduction of computers.
In those days, abacuses were still being used to perform calculations in the office. In fact, the ability to use an abacus was considered an essential skill for shosha professionals. Abacuses were given to new hires and abacus training was compulsory. Therefore, the transition to an Electronic Data Processing (EDP) system, which would uniformly handle everything from contracts and deliveries to payments, represented a huge leap. It took about two years to get the new system running, but after being brought on line in 1965, it contributed greatly to facilitating office work in the Steel Division, which had seen a tremendous expansion of its business. The know-how accumulated while introducing this system would later prove useful as the company further developed computer-based management platforms.
Meanwhile, there was also a need to improve communications. Around 1960, a dedicated telecommunications network linking offices in Japan was nearly completed. Communications with overseas offices were dependent on the infrastructure available in each country, but in 1962, the use of private dedicated lines between companies in Japan and the was approved and improvements in communications with other countries soon followed. In response to these developments, Shoji actively moved ahead to expand telex2 facilities, including dedicated lines, with overseas offices and other locations, thereby supporting the growth of international business. The telex office at the head office in Tokyo gathered information from all over the world. With its numerous wall clocks showing the time in locations around the globe, the office was symbolic of the feverish pace of business during the days of Japan's economic miracle.
By promoting such forward-thinking policies, Shoji proceeded to lay the foundation for further success.
1.
2.
When communicating via telex, messages were encoded on paper tape and then transmitted; on the receiving end, the messages would be reproduced in the form of paper tape before being rendered into text by another machine. Telex systems were an important means of communication that supported business during Japan's period of high economic growth.

Since 1954 vol.10 Mobilizing Companywide Efforts to Withstand Tough Economic Conditions Strives to Bolster Efficiency & Promote Organizational Reforms
We look back on efforts to bolster efficiency and promote organizational reforms under President Yohei Mimura.
Yohei Mimura became president of in June 1980 as the global economy continued to flounder due to the effects of the second oil crisis. In Japan, the basic materials industry, which consumed large quantities of imported raw materials and energy resources, was struggling; meanwhile, manufacturing and assembly-oriented enterprises, which utilized advanced technologies, were making great strides. This rapid reshaping of Japan's industrial structure had a large impact on shoshas because their business activities were heavily centered on the basic materials industry. also struggled as its earning power declined.
Through the autumn of 1979, President Mimura had served as president of International in the U.S., where he gained a strong grasp of the prevailing business climate. As president of MC, he promoted an earnings-focused approach to objectives management, while also calling for greater streamlining of operations. In April 1982, established the Efficiency Promotion Committee, which was chaired by President Mimura. Operation Rainbow was subsequently launched as part of companywide efforts to increase efficiency, promote streamlining and improve productivity.
combined top-down measures, such as a 20% reduction in non-business personnel, with bottom-up initiatives like the Circle Movement, through which all employees were asked to examine everyday operations and propose concrete ways to increase efficiency. Business operations were reinforced with an influx of personnel as employees were transferred from non-business departments. Meanwhile, a focus on cost containment spread throughout the company while promoted efforts to eliminate redundant operations and simplify internal procedures.
The Executive Committee, which had previously served as an advisory body to the president, was repositioned as the company's supreme decision-making body in July 1982. Meanwhile, the Managing Directors' Meeting was eliminated, with portions of its responsibilities being taken up by three specialized management committees. Business operations were also extensively restructured, as 14 divisions were reorganized into 19 divisions under six Business Groups. Administrative departments and other corporate divisions were reorganized in April of the following year.
The early 1980s brought various difficulties, including trade friction between the and Japan, but many notable achievements were also realized in overseas business, including sales of steelmaking plants in the and power generation facilities in oil producing countries, as well as the full scale development of the Saudi Arabian Petrochemical Project and expansion of business in Southeast Asia. Under President Mimura, employees across joined together to make concerted efforts to weather a period of low economic growth.

Since 1954 vol.6 The "Ayame Operations" Groundbreaking Management Plan Revitalizes the Company
We reflect back on the pioneering reforms instituted by President Chujiro Fujino, as Shoji sought to further develop its businesses during a period of high economic growth.
Shoji greatly expanded its operations during the 1960s, which called for a new organizational structure and redesigned management strategies. So in 1966, the company developed its first midterm business plan (the forerunner of today's midterm management plans).
The brainchild of President Fujino, the "Ayame (Iris*) Operations" were a companywide initiative that got into full swing in May of that year. Prior to establishing the plan, President Fujino had expressed his vision for the company to become a global leader in business innovation — a company with sound management and a progressive, systematic approach towards future growth.
In developing the Ayame Operations, each section and office was required to submit its own three-year plan. Based on these plans, President Fujino and his executive staff then drew up an image of where they wanted the company to be in three years' time. The result was a companywide blueprint that factored in both mid- and long-term objectives. The plan clarified key targets that would not have been feasible under Shoji's more traditional, one-year business plans. One such example was increasing the proportion of company earnings achieved by departments involved in growing business fields to 70% or more. Such domains included metals, machinery & construction, chemicals, and so on.
Another aim was to better address the unique matters faced by each organization, and thereby improve information sharing within the company as a whole. Accordingly, not only did the Ayame Operations establish financial targets, they also introduced organizational and HR-related reforms. The numerous business departments were reorganized into a more streamlined, division-based structure, with a company executive appointed of each division. The onus on earning profits was thereby decentralized. One after another, new measures like these were put in place to motivate employees and give them a greater sense of responsibility.
After assuming control of the company, President Fujino also began stressing the importance of good communication between top management and staff. He initiated the President's Meetings, which gave him a chance to converse directly with young and mid-career employees. He urged them not to be shy about expressing their opinions to superiors, and even suggested they approach him directly should issues go unresolved: "My door is always open", he said. Junior employees were greatly encouraged by the willingness of top management to listen to their concerns and ideas.
The practical, visionary reforms that President Fujino instituted were unprecedented. Despite the prosperous times, he refused to rest on his laurels, and the result was an even stronger Shoji — one that would remain unfazed by future upheavals in the world economy.
* In Japan, the iris is one of the flowers that symbolize the month of May.

Since 1954 vol.11 Embracing the Spirit of "Corporate Responsibility to Society" Development of Social Contribution Activities & Establishment of Shoji & Sun
In this final installment, we look back on the development of MC's social contribution activities.
It was October 1973 when first established an office to oversee social and environmental affairs. The origins of MC's philanthropic activities can be traced back to a speech by President Chujiro Fujino in which he underscored the importance of making contributions to society. "As good corporate citizens, companies should actively carry out programs to contribute to society, and the expense of these programs should be borne as part of the social cost of doing business, before reaping any profits," asserted President Fujino. In 1974, proceeded to launch the Friendship Camp for Mothers and Children and this program continues to be highly regarded as one of MC's signature social contribution activities.
In 1979, began its involvement in the field of social welfare when it commenced efforts to support occupational training for people with a severe physical impairment. Meanwhile, the United Nations designated 1981 as the International Year of Disabled Persons and various initiatives to create job opportunities for disabled people were promoted in Japan. President Yohei Mimura, who headed the company from 1980 to 1986, directed to redouble its efforts. had already developed cooperative ties with a social welfare based in Oita Prefecture called Japan Sun Industries, and together, they launched Shoji & Sun as a joint venture in December 1983. The new company garnered widespread attention as a groundbreaking enterprise as it set out to open up opportunities for people with impairments in IT-related fields, including data processing, systems design and programming.
While continually striving to expand its business, also came to place a strong emphasis on sustaining its involvement in wide-raging social contribution activities as a leader in the field of corporate social responsibility. has now been conducting social contributions activities for almost 40 years through initiatives centered in the five areas of global environment, public welfare, education, culture and art, and international exchange. Notable examples include the Tropical Forest Regeneration Experimental Project, the Global Coral Reef Conservation Project and the Art Gate Program. Since April 2011, has also been working to support recovery efforts following the Great East Japan Earthquake by dispatching employee volunteers to the disaster region and providing assistance via the Disaster Relief Foundation.
"Corporate Responsibility to Society" is one of the core tenets of MC's Three Corporate Principles. In the years ahead, will continue to carry out social contribution activities, characterized by sustained involvement and active employee participation, as one way of striving to live up to this ideal.

We focus on the development of the company's global network during the six-year tenure of President Katsujiro Takagaki.
In July 1954, the new Shoji established its head office in the Marunouchi district. After beginning with capital of 650 million yen, the company soon increased its capital to 2.5 billion yen, and in October 1956, raised it again to 5 billion yen. In 1958, the head office was moved to a new building in the Marunouchi district, which was built by Estate at the same location as today's Shoji Building.
President Takagaki strove to expand the company's global network. At the time the company was launched, liaison representatives were established at 14 locations across Latin America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia; meanwhile, International (MIC) was established in the with its head office in New York and a branch office in San Francisco.
In an effort to revitalize the Japanese economy, Shoji sought to stimulate export business, and while overcoming various obstacles, proceeded to establish the foundations for cultivating business around the world. In March 1955, the total number of overseas offices (including regional subsidiaries) reached 23. By March 1960, this number grew to 51, with 24 of these being either regional subsidiaries or branch offices of these subsidiaries; this figure also included the company's first liaison representative offices in Africa. By 1961, had some 200 employees at its head office and a nationwide workforce of 320 employees.
While expanding the company's global network, President Takagaki also focused efforts on promoting exports. He sought to gain a firm grasp of conditions in countries around the world as he visited Southeast Asia in 1954, the and Canada in 1956, and Europe and the Middle East in 1957. President Takagaki was intrigued by the potential of India. He decided the company should bolster its provision of technological assistance in the region. As a result, the Engineering Agency in Southeastern Asia was established in September 1955, inside the company's Calcutta Branch (today's Kolkata Branch). The agency was staffed with technical experts through cooperation with Heavy Industries, Electric and Kasei (now Chemical). In this way, President Takagaki paved the way for the development of the Group's business in India.
Note: We use to refer to after 1971, when the company adopted as its English name. We use Shoji when writing about the company before 1971.

Since 1954 vol.8 Staying True to the Spirit of the Three Corporate Principles Even in Times of Great Economic Turmoil
We look at how devised policies to fulfill its responsibility to society as a good corporate citizen during the period of economic turmoil that accompanied the Nixon Shock and the 1st Oil Crisis in the early 1970s.
Japan entered an extended period of high economic growth in the mid-1950s. adeptly picked up on this trend and proceeded to build up its organization and expand its business. However, the economic climate started to change in the 1970s. In September 1973, President Chujiro Fujino voiced his concerns in a message to the heads of all departments and offices: "Present economic conditions in Japan and abroad are decidedly unusual."
The first major blow to the global economy had come in the form of the Nixon Shock*. Then the 4th Middle East War erupted in October 1973, triggering the 1st Oil Crisis. In turn, this sparked a period of intense inflation, and rising prices further fueled growing social unrest. People did not just rush out to obtain petroleum-based products—they also bought up various everyday goods and products quickly disappeared from retailers' shelves. Frustrated Japanese consumers directed their anger toward shoshas, which were engaged in import-export activities. MC's sales for the 1974 fiscal year totaled 9.4 trillion yen, but this figure was largely the result of soaring prices. The actual volume of sales, adjusted for price increases, reveals a year-on-year decline of almost 7%.
During this difficult period, returned to its roots by reaffirming the spirit of its Three Corporate Principles. In June 1973, President Fujino made a company-wide announcement detailing the company's Standards of Conduct, which addressed activities in ten areas, including business involving general commodities, consideration for the environment, and harmony with local communities. In this way, President Fujino sharpened the focus on the spirit of the Three Corporate Principles while clarifying MC's business philosophy and the high standards expected of all employees.

In 1971, President Richard Nixon announced a series of economic measures including the discontinuation of the direct convertibility of dollars to gold and a 10% surcharge on imports. These measures sent shockwaves throughout the global economy and forced other developed countries to adopt floating exchange rate systems. The value of the yen had previously been fixed at 360 yen to the dollar, but this system was abolished. These changes represented great challenges for the Japanese economy—and especially for sogo shoshas, which suddenly had to incorporate consideration for foreign currency risk, exchange gains and losses and many other new factors into their business activities.

Contributing to Society Even in Troubled Times
In 1920, the Japanese economy fell into recession and was in a state of disarray following a post-boom and due to plummeting stock prices caused by the tightening of monetary policy. The old Trading Company (Shoji Kaisha - disbanded in 1947), which had only just been established in 1918, had to endure extremely difficult circumstances and was forced to suspend dividends for three years from 1919.
Faced with these circumstances, Koyata Iwasaki, the first chairman of the old Shoji Kaisha, and fourth president of Mitsubishi, called a meeting for all office general managers*1 at headquarters. Standing before the assembled managers, who were resigned to being blamed for the company's results, he used the occasion to explain the need to question the economic function of trade and the responsibility of trading companies to producers and consumers. An excerpt of his speech is as follows: "We must wholeheartedly embrace competition, but we must compete fairly. And want us to compete in terms of quality, not quantity. However, we must be careful not to get so caught up in competing that we use any means to justify the end. This would be regrettable in light of our founding traditions. We mustn't speculate with the aim of profiteering, so as to get rich quick."
*1 General managers of bases in Japan and overseas are generally referred to as office general managers.
Passing the Spirit of the Three Corporate Principles to Future Generations
The first issue of the in-house newsletter published in 1954 featured the Three Corporate Principles
Based on the leadership of Mr. Iwasaki, the Three Corporate Principles were formulated in 1934 as the core values for the company. The spirit of these principles has been kept alive by successive generations of employees and remains to this day the touchstone for fulfilling our responsibilities to the global environment and society as we conduct business.
For instance, when we conduct business in a new region, we communicate with all local stakeholders including the people that live there. We engage in business mindful of contributing to the development of local communities such as by taking into account the natural environment, creating jobs, and improving living environments. This approach extends across entire value chains, from upstream resource development and procurement to downstream sales and services.
Today the spirit of the Three Corporate Principles remains the cornerstone of our organizational and corporate culture and represents what stands for. As a good corporate citizen, we will ensure that the spirit of the Three Corporate Principles lives on through our core businesses.
