"Most side effects of radiotherapy, including radiotherapy delivered with systems, are mild and temporary, often involving fatigue, nausea, and skin irritation. Side effects can be severe, however, leading to pain, alterations in normal body functions (for example, urinary or salivary function), deterioration of quality of life, permanent injury and even death. Side effects can occur during or shortly after radiation treatment or in the months and years following radiation. The nature and severity of side effects depend on many factors, including the size and location of the treated tumor, the treatment technique (for example, the radiation dose), the patient’s general medical condition, to name a few. For more details about the side effects of your radiation therapy, and if treatment with an product is right for you, ask your doctor."	1

"The business, and climate, case for biomass"			
"Did you know that over one million vehicles in Europe ran onboard gasifiers during to make fuel from wood and charcoal, as gasoline and diesel were rationed or otherwise unavailable?  Long before there was biodiesel and ethanol, we actually succeeded in a large-scale, alternative fuels redeployment– and one which curiously used only cellulosic biomass, not the oil and sugar based biofuel sources which famously compete with food."			
1 tonne of biomass input to the gasifier can soil-sequester the equivalent of 0.185 CO2 tonnes in the atmosphere.

We consider this Philosophy as our compass, guiding how we will behave and the decisions we will make. We are establishing our Patient Access Philosophy before we have an approved medicine because we know that, too often, patients have trouble accessing the medicines their doctor prescribes. We have come too far and there is too great of a need for our future medicines to accept this situation for our patients."

"Utilizing algae for biofuel production is not a novel idea, having been first mentioned over 50 years ago. The Department of Energy explored this concept through the Aquatic Species Program (ASP) from the late 1970s until 1996.  When the program ended, oil was ~$20/barrel, making renewable energy generally, and algae-derived fuels in particular, uneconomic.  The concluded that producing biofuels from microalgae was feasible; however technology at that time did not allow for economic viability."			
Biodiesel			
Produce much more bio-oil per acre than traditional biodiesel crops			
It is not a scalable solution for replacing a significant percentage of fossil fuels			
"This website is about a renewable energy company exploring new sources of feedstock for the production of biofuels. In particular, utilizes microalgae to generate bio-oil, which can be converted into biodiesel."

"Hyaluronic acid is a crucial substance not only in the beauty industry, but also in general medicine. It is a natural product occurring in animal joints, eyes and other body organs where it performs numerous biological functions. It has unique properties that contribute to its wide application in various areas such as eye procedures, dermal filler in plastic surgery, management of skin conditions, and wound healing. Hyaluronic acid can be isolated from its natural sources and modified for external use, particularly in cosmetics use where low molecular weight is desired. This compound is purified to make it free of contaminants such as residual proteins that may lead to allergic reactions when used in the body."

Less than 50% of the capital cost compared to conventional monocrystalline silicon wafer technology			
"The company has established  a semi-automated pilot line to demonstrate the manufacturing-worthiness and  scalability of this technology.was  founded in 2008 and has developed a breakthrough manufacturing technology  called Direct Gas to Waferâ„¢ that allows for direct conversion of feedstock  gas to mono crystalline silicon wafers by high throughput epitaxial  growth.  By skipping the polysilicon,  ingoting and wire-sawing steps altogether, our patented approach results not  only in the lowest cost/watt for wafers but also significantly reduces the  capital required to set up a manufacturing plant. "			
"These so called kerfless wafers have achieved  well over 24% efficiency in  customer trials and are now enabling existing crystalline cell and module  makers to significantly enhance their power output while reducing cell making  steps, thereby radically reducing the cost structure of panels."

"The foundations of his business emphasized both morality and public-spiritedness, based on his belief in the necessity of pursuing both profit and the economic development of society at the same time. To carry out this business philosophy, he had to undergo many bitter ordeals. During the turbulent decades of the 1920s and 1930s, many of his businesses were on the brink of being swept up in nationwide panics, and was no exception. Many companies were closed down and withdrew from business. Katsujiro Iwai maintained an unwavering belief that businesses should never swerve from their course in pursuit of temporary gains or because of temporary problems."

Design for very high-speed requirements for device structures			
We are pushing solar cell efficiencies through our innovative approaches in nanostructured materials design that harnesses energy from a broadband of wavelengths.			
"and the unique nanostructure-based optical coatings to minimize reflection losses which enhances the light trapping within the photovoltaic devices. Our design uses nanostructure to horizontally scatter light that enters the cell to substantially increase the travel path of the light. This innovation addresses another shortcoming of the traditional cells where the travel path, particularly in thin-film cells, is small and therefore all the energy that enters the cell is not converted to electric power."			
"is working in several directions to help drive the cost of power down to achieve parity with power delivered by the electricity grid. In pursuing this quest, we use revolutionary photovoltaic cell device designs and methods of manufacturing."

"The scientific community, while dispersed worldwide, is basically small. It is, therefore, unnecessary for a business to be located in a major metropolitan area in order to provide service. After nine years of dealing with increasing traffic, spiraling housing costs, congestion and an unresponsive city government, it was time for a change. This change was aided by the widespread growth of fax and other electronic communication media as well as the growth of parcel delivery services nationwide. So, in the summer of 1990, moved to Coeur d’Alene in northern Idaho’s beautiful Kootenai County."

Nanotechnology Corporate Partners (NCP) Program			
"Through technologically advanced innovative systems, is able to infuse billions of 4-to-6 nanometer sized diamonds into oils.  Nano diamond material at this size functions like ball bearings by transforming the sliding friction that normally occurs between metal surfaces into rolling friction, thereby substantially reducing friction, heat, wear and early oil failure."			
Over 8 years of research and development have created the next generation of “Innovations for Lubricants”.  Our patented nano diamond technology completely revolutionizes lubricant performance.			
"Even though diamonds are considered one of the hardest substances known to man, at nanometer size they actually polish and keep debris from attaching to the metal.  Each nano diamond is encapsulated in oil and while residing in the pores of the metal, they help seal out moisture and debris that would otherwise attack metal surfaces. Unlike Molybdenum, Graphite, or other additives being used today, nano diamonds will not break down or flatten out during use.  That is why using nano diamond products will help protect the metal surfaces of your engines, equipment and other machinery."

"Further down the pipeline, the company is also engaged in developing pigs capable of producing fully human antibodies for use as vaccines against infectious agents (ie. anthrax, MRSA, H1N1, HIV); this is an ongoing pre-clinical program which has been funded through the Department of Defense with a market potential capable of surpassing all other products combined."			
"Revivicorâ€™s product development pipeline addresses focus areas of large unmet clinical need and thus large commercial markets. For diabetes, there are currently 3 million patients in the with Type1 diabetes, on insulin, who could be transplanted now, if not for the dire shortage of donor tissue. At $20,000 net sales per transplant, this is a projected $60 billion market. Recently published results demonstrated that pancreatic islet cells from pigs, when transplanted into diabetic monkeys, cured diabetes for over 1 year with complete normalization of blood glucose levels ( van der Windt et al., 2009 ). The pigs used in these studies were engineered such that a human gene (â€œCD46â€�) was added, and a key pig gene (alpha-Gal) was deleted, as a means to overcome transplant rejection issues. It is anticipated that insulin-producing islet cells from Revivicorâ€™s cloned pigs could be in human clinical trials within 3 years time."

Many different approaches have been taken to get more electricity off of solar cells from moving the electrical contacts to the rear to wiring mesh interconnection to replace busbars. Solaria managed to remove busbars entirely by slicing solar cells into segments and stringing them together. This results in attaching cells with no busbars which brings more aesthetically pleasing look as well as increased efficiency.

"Tadao Hashimoto joined Professor Matsunami's laboratory at Kyoto University in 1990. His research covered plasma-assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of amorphous silicon carbide for solar cells and photo-assisted metalorganic molecular beam epitaxy (MOMBE) of gallium phosphide. He was awarded bachelor of electrical engineering in 1991 and master of electrical engineering in 1993 from Kyoto University. In 1993, he joined Panasonic and worked for 6 years as a research engineer of semiconductor lasers and metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) of GaAs-based alloys and GaN-based alloys. From 1997 to 1999, he stayed at Stanford University as a visiting researcher working on hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) of GaIn 1999 he left Panasonic and in 2000 he started his Ph.study at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He joined the Nakamura Inhomogeneous Crystal Project and started research on the ammonothermal growth of GaIn 2005, he was awarded Ph.in science from and continued his research on the ammonothermal growth at In 2007, he received Outstanding Research Achievement Award form Solid State Lighting and Display Center at He is the founder of Materials, Inc."			
"Materials, Inc. was founded on September 29th, 2006, as a spin-off from the Nitrides' group in the department at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) . The company's core technology is the ammonothermal growth of bulk Gacrystal, which was developed at under Nakamura Inhomogeneous Crystal Project in the Exploratory Research for Advanced Technology (ERATO) Program , led by Professor Nakamura the pioneer of GaN-based LEDs and laser diodes. Ammonothermal technology will provide higher quality, lower cost Gawafers than the conventional Gawafers produced only by hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE). This revolutionary technology will expand the usage of Gawafers to many new applications such as low-cost lightings and blue/green laser diodes for compact projectors."

"In the X-Ray mode, electrons are accelerated to near the speed of light using microwaves into a dense metals which emits x-Rays that pass through the product breaking the chain of pathogens in the product. The product will pass in front of the beam and then be rotated 1800 to make a pass on its side. X-Ray is primary used with bulky, non uniform, high density products."			
FAQ?			
"We typically sterilize medical products in the original shipping containers, saving you time and maintaining package integrity. As the beam is scanned through the product, the electrons interact with materials and create secondary energetic species, such as electrons, ion pairs, and free radicals. These secondary energetic species are responsible for the inactivation of the microorganisms as they disrupt the chain of the microorganism, thus rendering the product sterile."

The Underground Construction crews did a great job of using their experience, skills and ingenuity to use multiple tools at the same time from the same launch pits to install more than one service at a time.  Doubling their production. Very clever on their part!  However, Underground Constructions’ Area Manager Jim Dillon reached out to me asking to bring in a compact directional drill to try and improve productions for the longer service installations, especially in these tough, narrow working conditions.  We worked out a schedule to get our 4out and give it a try.”"

"For example, if a customer pays for electricity on a time of use plan from their power company, a lighting device that stores energy when the electricity rates are low and uses the stored energy when the electricity rates are high may save money on their electric bill by using that stored power intelligently.  In a similar example, a customer can reduce the amount of power it consumes from the power company by using a local power source to power a lighting device helping the power company deal with periods of time when there is a peak in energy consumption that puts a strain on their ability to supply power."

Corporation’s patented Windbeam micro generator captures from airflow to recharge batteries and power electronic devices.			
"Corporation aims to capitalize on rapid growth of the Internet of Things movement and a worldwide need for clean, renewable energy."			
The Windbeam’s novel design allows it to operate silently in wind speeds as low as 2 mph. The generator consists of a lightweight beam suspended by durable long-lasting springs within an outer frame. The beam oscillates rapidly when exposed to airflow due to the effects of multiple fluid flow phenomena. linear alternator assembly converts the oscillating beam motion into usable electrical energy. lack of bearings and gears eliminates frictional inefficiencies and noise. The generator can operate in low-light environments unsuitable for solar panels (e.g. ducts) and is inexpensive due to low cost components and simple construction. The scalable technology can be optimized to satisfy the requirements and design constraints of a given application.			
The following is a list of and foreign granted and pending Windbeam patents:

"The motivation for starting was the frustration had experienced as a scientist when trying to acquire high quality nanomaterials. Every time ordered a product from a nanomaterial or chemical company would spend many hours performing characterization only to realize that the shape, size distribution, agglomeration state, or chemical purity was not what was expecting. would be forced to discard the material and try another vendor. This was a time-consuming and completely unnecessary impediment to the development of technologies and products that leverage the new and exciting properties of nanomaterials."
