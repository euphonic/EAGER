Our Vision
Visionaries change the world in unanticipated and improbable ways.
Who would have thought that consumers would listen to music and books on the iPod, and in the process saved the music industry? Steve Jobs did.
Who would have thought that consumers would get into a car ordered from an app on their phone, disrupting the ride-hailing industry? Travis Kalanick did.
Who would have thought that a company named Amazon could get consumers to shop online and upend the entire retail industry? Jeff Bezos did.
That disruptive technology is here again: infOsci’s patented Ci4™ authentication and encryption technology enhances cybersecurity by eliminating the risk of data breaches and improving the customer experience.
Our vision is of a world in which passwords are relics of the past and never have to be changed or kept secret.
