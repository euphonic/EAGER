Our initial focus was on the development of a different type of magneto resistive recording head known as Dual Stripe or                      These products offered significant performance advantages to our customers and have been used by Seagate in their industry leading server disk drives                      and by Toshiba in their high capacity mobile disk drives.
In 1997, the Company began development of soft adjacent layer magneto resistive products in order to provide industry standard products as part of our product offerings.
During 1999, we introduced our giant magneto resistive products. Giant magneto resistive is an advanced application of magneto resistive technology.                      With these products we provide our customers with recording heads which provide information-handling capabilities unsurpassed in the industry.
On March 31, 2000, was acquired by Corporation, through its subsidiary Corporation.                      The combination of TDK, and is the sole independent recording head company in the world.
