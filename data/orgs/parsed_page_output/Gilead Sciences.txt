This is why, through our grantee programs, works hard to foster deep and enduring relationships with patient advocates, nonprofits and healthcare professionals around the world who work tirelessly in local communities to improve people’s lives day after day.
works with organizations across all our therapeutic areas, partnering to advance the goals of our giving mission: to improve health access, eliminate the barriers to healthcare encountered by underserved populations, advance education among healthcare professionals and support the local communities in which we operate.
Providing Access
believes medicines should be accessible to all people who need them, regardless of where they live or what resources they have. Political, social and geographical barriers prevent patients around the world from accessing the best possible care, so we work with partners and grantees to help overcome those barriers.

People should have access to the same healthcare, regardless of their background. At Gilead, we fund projects that support underserved communities that have systematically experienced greater social or economic obstacles to health.
Advancing Medical Education

Supporting Local Communities

Ethics and Code of Conduct
Ethics & Code of Conduct
Our Employees
The Code of Ethics requires employees' compliance with all laws and mandates fair dealing in all instances. Violations of our Code of Ethics by employees are not tolerated and can lead to disciplinary action, including termination of employment and referral for criminal prosecution. As part of our commitment to ensure our products are free from violations of all types of ethical standards, we plan to update our Code of Ethics and employee training materials to include provisions specifically targeted to address human slavery and trafficking.
Read the Code of Ethics
Countries of Origin
We routinely evaluate and address the risk of ethical violations for all countries involved in our supply chain. We do not routinely engage a third party to conduct this evaluation. Rather, we rely on official government information to identify risks and act accordingly. Our product ingredients are sourced primarily from countries the United States Department of State has designated as being compliant with the Trafficking Victims Protection Act's (TVPA) minimum standards. We take extra precautions before sourcing product from countries that are still making efforts to bring themselves into full compliance with the For example, in those countries, we source only from businesses that are affiliated with countries fully compliant with TVPA, visit our suppliers along with their intermediates and vendors in person and only select suppliers that have been in business long enough to verify that their conduct meets Gilead's ethical standards.
