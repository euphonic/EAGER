Sunpower is one of the top companies making solar panels in 2018. These panels have the highest efficiency currently on the market and deliver maximum value and superb performance throughout their whole life. It is one of the most innovative and sustainable companies providing a large number of customers with workable solutions and valuable services. The company is headquartered in Silicon Valley but also has dedicated employees all around Asia, Europe, South and North America, Australia.
Efficiency
These panels are the most efficient on the market because of their Series panels which claim an impressive 21,5 % average panel efficiency. Although they may be a bit more expensive, they are usually one of the most favourite choices for anyone who considers efficiency as their top priority. EnergySage rated Sunpower Premium Plus which definitely makes them above-average.
Power production
Based on their power output at (standard test condition), these panels are rated at particular wattage which involves 1000 watts of irradiation per square metre at a temperature of 25 (77 F). The temperature Sunpower coefficient is around average when compared to other better brands of panels. However, the temperature coefficient of -0.29 % from Sunpower series panels is absolutely the highest.
Warranty
Sunpower offers a “product warranty” which is significantly longer than a standard 10-year warranty. This warranty is limited to physical and mechanical defects. The warranty includes the following benefits:
-it covers rust damage such as in seaside installations
-it doesn’t require receipts, proof of purchase and written claims
-it provides repair or a replacement without any additional costs
The company guarantees at least 98 per cent power for the first year which is followed by a maximum degradation rate of 0.25 per cent each year thereafter for 24 years.
Cost
One of the most important factors when choosing your solar panel is definitely the cost. When it comes to Sunpower solar panels, it’s really hard to see their entire price. However, retails systems seem to be available with a tier one string inverter for around $3.50 per watt which is around $o.40 cents per wat more when compared to other leading brands. Keep in mind that they are sold as a premium offering.
Solar energy is being widely used to power pretty much everything, from solar panels to solar ovens and solar cookers . One of the ways you can also make use of solar energy is to install solar pool heater that will help you keep your pool’s temperature pleasant.
Corporate value of the company
The company is undoubtedly best-known for the Sunpower series of monocrystalline panels which are widely used across America. They also make series of monocrystalline panels in the range of 320 to 327 watts whose maximum efficiency is 20.4 % which is pretty impressive.
Pros
They offer a 25-year warranty on both product and panel performance which ensures that the panels have paid for themselves before a warranty expires.
They have the most efficient solar panels used widely across the market.
The solar panels have the highest ratings compared to their nominal power rating at mainly because of their temperature coefficient.
Cons
It is widely believed that Sunpower solar panels are manufactured in the which is not really the case. They have factories in China, Mexico and Philippines.
All the quality, attractive look and warranty protection come at a premium price.
Keep in mind that you will also need an efficient portable solar generator when looking for a solar panel.
Panasonic Solar Panels
Panasonic is undoubtedly one of the largest manufacturers of consumer electronics and solar panels. Panasonic Solar Panels have won both 2017 and 2018 best solar panels brand award. They definitely set pace in terms of performance efficiency.
There are four criteria you need to take into consideration when thinking about whether you want to purchase Panasonic solar panels for your home :
efficiency
Performance
Warranties
cost
Efficiency
Panasonic’s most efficient panel is N330 with an impressive efficiency of 19.7 %. This makes Panasonic a top brand when it comes to solar panels. However, keep in mind that its efficiency varies greatly depending on the model you choose for your home. Generally, Panasonic panel efficiency ranges between 19.4% to 21.6% unlike the majority of others fall in the 14% to 18%. In other words, Panasonic solar panels belong to the group of the most efficient solar panels on the market.
Performance
In order to evaluate the performance of Panasonic solar panels, you need temperature coefficient as an indicator. The temperature coefficient tells you how much your panels performance changes during hot sunny summer days. You need to take into account that the solar panels you install will see more than a few hot and sunny days during the year and will ideally have the lowest temperature coefficient possible. Panasonic’s solar panels have probably the lowest temperature coefficient in the industry at -0.29.
Warranty
Panasonic offers a 15 year structural warranty referred to as a “product guarantee”. Which is a longer than the standard 10 year. Their warranty guarantees 90% of rated output from the panels at standard test conditions for the first ten years and then 80% of rated power thereafter out to 25 years against any defects in their solar panels.
Cost
The total price you pay for Panasonic solar panels largely depends on the additional equipment you choose for the installation of panels such as inverters and mounts. Also, the price depends on the characteristics the characteristics of your roof. Although it is hard to find out the wholesale price of Panasonic solar panels, according to the quotes from installers, most of the systems are usually priced between $3.37 and $3.86 per watt.
Pros
Panasonic offers a 25 year product and performance warranty which puts it in the line of other solar panel manufacturers.

Besides using solar panels for your home, you can also make more use of sun energy and make your home more secure by using solar gate openers or a solar attic fan.
Solar Panels
is one of the best-known companies in the world with an extensive experience behind. After almost ten years of module manufacturing, are now manufacturing their fourth generation panels and there is only a small number of companies that can compete with solar panels are highly rated by customers worldwide not only because of the high standard of detail and finish, but also because of their impressive look.
The Neon2 range of panels has incorporated BiFacial cell which captures the light from both the top and bottom of the cell allowing a much greater efficiency unlike a standard cell that has a polymer backing sheet that doesn’t allow the reflected light from underneath to reach the cell.
residential solar panels include:
Mono Plus – 300W
Neon 2 – 330-335W
Neon – 360-370W
commercial and bifacial modules (Neon 2 – 40572 cell, Neon 2 – 390bifacial)
Strength and Durability
One of the the reasons why these panels are so sought-after is the fact that they have extremely strong double aluminium frames on all modules with an impressive 6000 Pa on the front side and 5400 on the rear side. According to the recent report, the Neon 2 modules underwent static load testing and were able to withstand incredible 10,000 Pa without failure. These modules have extremelu high level of corrosion resistance and can be installed in coastel locations
Efficiency
manufacturers focus on producing a wide range of mono and polycrystalline panels which have greater level of efficiency and lower degradation unlike other lower-cost poly or multi-crystalline cells. Naturally, efficiency of panels largely depends on the model you choose. panels have approximately 16.9 % efficiency, and premium solar products operate with impressive 19.5 efficiency.
solar panel efficiency:
-Mono efficiency – up to 18.3%
-Neon 2 efficiency – up to 19.6%
-Neon efficiency – up to 21.4%
uses Lilly technology (boron combined with hydrogen) to reduce the rate of light induced degradation (LID) in the cells used in the Mono panels.
All of this puts in the top of 10% of solar panel brands for efficiency.
Quality and Performance
Cost
When choosing the right solar panel for your home, the price plays an important role. Generally, systems are typically priced at between $3.30 and $3.67 per watt. In other words, if you want to but an average 5 ksystem , your gross cost would be from $16,500 to $18,350. As with other solar panels, it is hard to get the wholesale price of solar panels. However, retail systems seem to be available for around $3.20 per watt if you are paying in cash. The best way to find out which solar panel will perfectly suit your needs and home is to get multiple quotes with different solar equipment options.

Warranty
While most of the manufacturers provide 10 years of product warranty period, offers 25 years of product and performance warranty, offered by Neon and Neon 2 panels which is two years above industry standard. On top of that, performance has a minimum 86% retained capacity after 25 years on Neon 2 and Mono X.
Product Warranty:
Performance Warranty:
Sustainability
Another thing to keep in mind is the sustainability of solar panels. Electronics has been nominated many times by Corporate Knights as one of the top 100 sustainable corporations on the market. Due to the fact that produces highly efficient and long-lasting solar panels, they are generally more sustainable than many other which failed only after a few years.
Pros
-huge panel efficiency levels (when compared to Sunpower), because they gather more power per sq foot than most manufacturers on the market.
-warranties offer residual %87 power generating capacity 25 years after installation
-an internationally recognised company providing a safe and reliable option.
Cons
-a high cost which can be up to triple the price per watt respected tier 1 manufacturers
-not the most efficient panels when compared to the impressive Sunower or Panasonic but still at the top rank.
Besides sun power, wind energy is one of the new forms of viable energy you can take advantage. For example, home wind turbines are efficient and powerful and can last for decades.
Hanwha Solar Panels
Hanwha belongs to the group of the biggest sellers of solar panels in the world – in 2017 they produced 5.44 gigawatts which was a major increase from 4.58 gigawatts they produced in 2016. It is also one of the largest photovoltaic manufacturers worldwide based in Seoul, South Korea and Thalheim in Germany.
Here are some things you need to know when looking for a suitable Hanwha solar panel:
Efficiency
Most panels fall into a group of “standard” efficiency range for solar. Generally, the efficiency of these solar panels runs between 16 to 19 percent. Although the Cell series cant quite match the efficiency of Sunpower, it is still a competitive entry regarding the overall efficiency. However, the panels with 18% efficiency or higher are considered to be highly efficient.
Power Output
Another thing you should consider is the power each solar panel produces, or the (Watt Peak) rating. One of the series options, the BLK-G5, offers a output of 300 to 320 Watts. Therefore, despite not so high level of efficiency, there solar panels offer a comparable amount of total power when compared to Sunpower options.
Cost
Most Hanwha systems are typically priced between $2.95 and $3.52 per watt, which makes one of the best values on the market for home solar. In other words, the price for an average 5 ksystem is anywhere from $14,750 to $17,600. Although these solar panels do not have top-level efficiency and productivity, their prices match their quality and is a good solution for many homeowners who are looking for the best solar panels for their home.

Besides using solar panels, there are many different ways you can use powerful solar energy. For instance, if you have a flag at your home or business, you may want to make it more visible during night. The easiest way to do this is to use solar power flagpole light which does not require any other energy besides sun power.
Solaria Solar Panels
California-based solar panel manufacturer produces sleek, highly efficient and all-black solar panels. It’s definitely a rising star in this industry as they are a fantastic option for residential installation – reliable, efficient and attractive on the rooftop. To help you get a full insight into the value of these solar panels, we did a research and this is what we have found out:
Efficiency
Solaria solar panels have an efficiency rating of 18.7% to 19.3% which puts them in the Premium category when it comes to solar panels efficiency. An interesting fact you should be aware of is that only 5 percent of solar panels meet the criteria for Premium rating. Solaria solar panels run a patented cell cutting and eliminate busbars and ribbon interconnections.
The cells are cut and overlaid without soldering which results in creating a highly reliable power unit assembly. On top of that the Powermodule is specially design to cut he power losses caused by shadowing access the module. Solaria’s patented cell cutting and ‘high density’ sub-strings are packed more efficiently and reduce inactive space between cells.
The Look
One of the most important goals of Solaria is to produce appealing and good looking solar panels. With these solar panels, all black shingled solar cells are combined with a black frame which makes them even more attractive. The Powermodule has a visually stunning appearance when compared to any other solar system on the market. This appearance is achieved by removing visual gaps between cells.
Warranty
Unlike the most manufacturers which offer 10 years warranty, Solaria offers a remarkable 25-year warranty against any defects in their solar panels which is why they earn a Premium panel rating. In other words, the warranty leads the industry because they give 25 year hardware and production coverage. On top of that it has excellent snow tolerance and has been tested for sal mist in coastal climates as well as for sand and dust in desert climates.
Technology
Many different approaches have been taken to get more electricity off of solar cells from moving the electrical contacts to the rear to wiring mesh interconnection to replace busbars. Solaria managed to remove busbars entirely by slicing solar cells into segments and stringing them together. This results in attaching cells with no busbars which brings more aesthetically pleasing look as well as increased efficiency.
Unique shade tolerance
When it comes to shading, these solar systems are highly efficient. Once a solar panel experience shading it might stop producing energy if it doesn’t have micro solar panel inverter /optimizers. This can significantly affect its production. The Solaria Powersolar panels will only be partially affected. For instance, if 10 % of this solar panel is shaded it would produce 10% less power instead of zero energy like regular solar panels would.
Performance
To evaluate the performance, we needed to take temperature coefficient into account. The temperature coefficient tells you how much your panels performance will change when it is really hot out in the open air. All Solaria panels have temperature coefficient rating of -0.40%/°which means that if panels temperature increases by one degree, its electricity production will reduce by 0.4.
Pros
These solar panels have weatherproof anodized black aluminium frame
Sub-strings of solar cells in the module are interconnected in parallel which significantly improves shade tolerance.
They have efficient modern design without busbars which also increases efficiency up to 20%.
Lower system price due to more power per square foot. This also results in the decrease in the number of panels as well as installation labor costs.
Certified for up to 1,000 volt solar panel system arrays.
Cons
No cons could be found.
While solar panels help you save you electricity and become more eco-friendly, there are ways you can use solar power to keep your property well-protected at all times. For example, an electric fence needs charging and the best way to charge it without spending too much money on electricity is to invest in an efficient solar fence charger.

Some Hyundai panels offer panel efficiency rates of up to 17.2%, which is below the 21% efficiency rates offered by market leaders leader. According to EnergySage, Hyundai solar panels fall into the “economy” category. The efficiency of solar panels vary from a model to a model. Check out the list of solar panel efficiency in the list below:
Performance
When considering the solar panel performance you need to take temperature coefficient into account. The ideal temperature for solar panels is 77 degrees. The lower the temperature coefficient the better. Hyundai’s temperature coefficient is between -0.45 and -0.41 which means that the panel produces 0.40% less energy for every degree over 25°C/77°F.
Cost
Most Hyundai systems are typically priced between $2.83 and $3.10 per watt, which puts them below average in the market for home. Although Hyundai solar panels don’t offer a particularly high efficiency and performance, they are a low-cost option especially for people looking who have a significant roof space and are interested in buying a solar panel from a trusted brand. NAturally, prices may vary significantly based on where you are located and what suppliers near you can offer you. Before choosing the right solar panel for you, check out the marketplace.
Warranty
Output warranty
Product warranty
The output warranty covers 90% of minimum power for the last ten years. From year 11 to 25, there is a minimum 80% power output.
Generally, Hyundai offers a warranty that is lacking in comparison to some other manufacturers who offer a 90% output warranty after 25 years alongside a 25-year product warranty. Also, it provides a linear 30-year performance warranty.
The good thing is that Hyundai produce a variety of other products.
