The performance choice
& is our fracture technologies business and is the world’s largest supplier of ceramic proppant. has been at the forefront of proppant innovation s1987.
The portfolio of high quality, high performance proppant and unique fracture technologies helps our clients build and maintain the optimal balance of contact and conductivity. Our technologies and services overcome issues that can lead to reduced production and recovery, and expensive well servicing.  As a result, choosing high performance proppant and fracture technologies leads to lower F&cost per BOE.
With an optimal fracture design, choosing high performance proppant can achieve increased production and with no increase in AFE, while any additional initial proppant investment will have a fast payback. This makes the choice for production and economic performance.
Our fracture technologies portfolio includes
High quality, high performance proppant
 – Build fractures with the highest level of conductivity and the optimal contact in any reservoir to 
create more space to flow
 and long-term durability, delivering higher production, increased recovery and improved return on investment.
Proppant-delivered production assurance
 – Safeguard the fracture and production systems from scale deposit and other production impediments efficiently and for the long-term with simple proppant-delivered production assurance well treatments.
Proppant-delivered flow enhancement
 – Increase effective fracture length, conductivity and permeability by avoiding trapped water and water-based fluids in proppant pack pore throats, and reduce pressure drops caused by multiphase flow effects.
Proppant-delivered fracture evaluation services
 – Use safe, high-definition detection of proppant location and measurement of propped fracture height to efficiently optimize fracture design, stage and perforation spacing, and better understand near-wellbore connectivity.

Contact Environmental and social responsibility
Sustainability
has established initiatives that are intended to demonstrate responsibility and enhance sustainability in our operations. These initiatives are integral to the company’s long-term business strategy. In addition to the letter from our President and CEO, we encourage you to read more about our sustainability efforts.
Environmental responsibility
Site selection for minimal impact
cares about being a good neighbor in the communities where we operate and work. We select locations for our facilities that have natural screening features such as trees, hills, and existing buildings. We focus on preserving these features to maintain a buffer between our facilities and their surroundings to minimize their impact on the area.
Low-impact mining practices and reclamation
Our mining contractors use low-impact practices and reclamation efforts to reduce the impact of our mining activities on the environment.  Once a mine has been exhausted, soil and other materials are placed in the mine to return the land’s contours. Trees and other native vegetation also are placed to minimize erosion and enhance the appearance of the property.
Emission control technologies
uses innovative emission control technologies such as dry sorbent injection (DSI) technology to control air pollutant emissions at our two largest manufacturing plants in Millen, Georgia and Toomsboro, Georgia. has important advantages over competing technologies like wet scrubbers, which requires significant quantities of water and also produces large volumes of wastewater. By using DSI, has reduced emissions of several pollutants by as much as 90 percent while at the same time preserving water resources.
Proactive environmental business
focuses on proactive management of E&environmental risks. The proprietary is a sprayed-on polymer coating that is environmentally-safe and adheres to a variety of surfaces, providing a seamless, durable layer of protection. It can be applied to new or existing tanks, bases, concrete revetments and other equipment. The is highly resistant to corrosion or damage due to chemicals or weather, virtually eliminating the risk of leaks or other environmental issues.
Repurposing waste material for productive use
works with its suppliers and customers to responsibly use off-specification proppant and waste materials. Because ceramic proppant is durable, inert and stable, it performs well as fill material for roads and other similar uses. Using scrap proppant in this way puts a waste material to good use and keeps it out of landfills and saves valuable disposal space.
Use of energy-efficient lighting in new manufacturing plants
has installed energy-efficient lighting throughout its new manufacturing plant in Millen, Georgia. In addition to saving significant amounts of electrical energy, lighting also operates with a much greater lifetime than incandescent or fluorescent lighting. This translates to less waste generated through disposal of spent fluorescent bulbs and tubes, and no hazardous waste sent to landfills.
Energy-efficient offices
Energy Center II, our headquarters office in Houston, Texas USA, is a Certified office building, according to United States Green Building Council specifications. Energy Center also meets the EPA’s Energy Star Certified Building standard.
Social responsibility
Award-winning safety
Our program is modeled on industry best-in-class standards, and we regularly receive recognition for safety achievements from a variety of professional organizations, including the Georgia Mining Association, the International Society of Mine Safety Professionals, the Industrial Minerals Association of North America and the Louisiana Chemical Association.
Conflict minerals
understands that the extraction, transportation and trade of certain mineral ores, such as gold or their derivatives, tin (cassiterite), tungsten (wolframite) and tantalum (columbite-tantalite or coltan), takes place in countries where significant human rights abuses are ongoing.  Consistent with our values and applicable law, does not engage in, support or participate in activities that contribute to these abuses.
Driving safety
Vehicle accidents are a significant risk to workers in the field of oil and gas production and their supporting service companies and providers. In response to this risk, conducts driving safety training to improve the ability of our employees to drive safely in hazardous and unfamiliar conditions.
Responsibility to employees
As well as focusing on workplace safety, we emphasize the health and wellbeing of our employees.
Responsibility to the community
We are diligent in recognizing our social responsibility within the communities where we work. We strive to lead by example, both by the Company and its employees donating financially and by participating in many charitable events throughout the year. supports a variety of community organizations including the American Heart Association, Child Advocates of Houston, the Georgia Mining Association/ Foundation and the Ronald McDonald House of Houston.
