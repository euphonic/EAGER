Asking the big questions. Working for big answers.
What if every fruit could fulfill its most delicious potential?
What if every grower, packer and retailer had more efficient ways to protect freshness?
What if we could better predict and prevent produce damage, to improve food safety, save billions and feed the world with fewer resources?
These are the questions that inspire us at AgroFresh, and drive us to help more kinds of customers and produce than ever before.
Founded in 1999 with groundbreaking 1-(1-Methylcyclopropene) based technologies that suppress ethylene development and its degrading effects on produce, we have built up unmatched knowledge and international commercial experience supporting growers, packers, retailers, exporters and marketers in their delivery of superior quality produce.
Today, we are extending our freshness science and partnering with like-minded innovators to deliver a broad range of Smarter Freshness integrated solutions to a wider range of produce applications.
