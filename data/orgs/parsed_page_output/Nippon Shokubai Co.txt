is a global chemical company, and boasts the world's top-class production capacity for acrylic acid and superabsorbent polymers. Acrylic acid was developed by establishing a method of propylene direct oxidation* – another world ﬁrst in 1970 – and a technology that has been widely adopted among leading overseas acrylic acid manufacturers. produces not only acrylic acid but also derivative products, such as acrylates and superabsorbent polymers. These products are used as raw materials for paints, adhesives, diapers and so on. Since they are in high demand, continues to operate its acrylic acid plants at full production capacity.
* An oxidation method in which propylene and oxygen are directly oxidi-zed via a catalyst
has been expanding its core businesses in superabsorbent polymers and acrylic acid globally, beginning with the establishment of a production base for the former in Tennessee, USA, in 1988. Today, with production bases in Japan, the US, Belgium, China, Indonesia, and Singapore, we provide a stable supply of the products on a global scale.
Superabsorbent polymers are used mainly in diapers. By drawing on the company's strengths such as its high product development capability, innovative manufacturing processes, in-house-manufactured raw materials and intellectual property strategy, boasts the world's top-level market share.
is Japanese for "catalyst." Catalysts are essential in the manufacture of chemical products; our name conveys the drive for growth through developing proprietary catalysts and reﬁning their capabilities.
The word ("Japan") in reﬂects our commitment to developing technologies in-house.
Whereas many chemical companies adopt technology from overseas, has focused on product development using proprietary technology since its founding.
As Shokubai's production processes are also developed in-house, it is proud of its manufacturing technology expertise, which constantly evolves through steady improvements made on the production ﬂoor.
Based on the direct oxidation of propylene, Shokubai's acrylic acid production technology is adopted over the world. Licensees of the technology include major acrylic acid manufacturers.
In 1985, began full-scale production of superabsorbent polymers at a plant with an annual capacity of 10,000 tons. With their application in diapers, its annual production capacity has grown to 710,000 tons over a quarter century later, and it continues to grow strongly.
In 2003, made a strategic decision to withdraw from the phthalic anhydride business, which had been a product since the company's founding, to concentrate on other areas. The company has since developed a structure that earns solid revenue from its core businesses in acrylic acid, superabsorbent polymers, and ethylene oxide.
We have been working from April 2014 on its long-term business plan and the 1st medium-term business plan which is the action plan for the initial three years. We have now formulated 2nd medium-term business plan "Reborn 2020 NEXT," which spans the period from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2020.
We reconfirm our intention to follow our corporate credo: "Safety takes priority over production," and we are making every effort to implement the preventive/corrective measures to avoid accidents. We believe that only through these actions will we be able to regain the confidence of stake holders as a chemical company.
We will deliver the products and services that provide affluence and comfort to people and society, and we will strive as a team to achieve the "Reborn Shokubai"—a company*) that everybody can be proud of.
*) company that promotes work safety and peace of mind
company that rewards people who make their best efforts and achieve results
company that people can be proud to work for.
The plan is designed to ensure safe, reliable production activities. The plan also highlights profitability over sales and acceleration of creating new businesses and products. During fiscal 2020, the final year of the plan, we aim to be in a position to prospect further strong Group growth for next ten years.
