Terms of Use & DisclaimerOverall risk evaluations (impact frequency/probability)
In order to devise and implement effective countermeasures for the risks that threaten our Group, we give risks three-level (high, medium or low) overall risk evaluations based on the impact of the risk occurring and its frequency/probability. Among these risks, we clarify the priority of those that are ranked high or medium and consider risk controls for each.
Risk investigations
In order to accurately understand risks that require responses, every year we distribute risk tables and risk questionnaires not only to every division in our company but also to our Group companies.
We also bring risks to the surface, conduct overall evaluations of them, and check the status of risk control implementation, for example. Moreover, we are working to reduce risks using a cycle by feeding back results.
Business Continuity Management (BCM)
We have established a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) with countermeasures for earthquakes, influenza outbreaks and other incidents. We are working to strengthen Business Continuity Management (BCM) by regularly reviewing the BCP, as well as by implementing earthquake response training and other measures.

For Compliance with Anti-Bribery Laws ( Group's Code of Conduct )
Group Companies strictly prohibit any corruptions in breach of applicable laws in our business activities.
In order to express and give shape of such group policy, we adopt the group code of conduct, which all the individuals working for Group Companies should comply with.
For Compliance with Competition Laws  ( Group's Code of Conduct )
Group Companies will conduct all business transactions based on free and fair market competition principle.
In order to express and give shape of such group policy, we adopt the group code of conduct, which all the individuals working for Group Companies should comply with.
Rank-based training
Rank-based training
We provide training and lecture sessions in corporate ethics targeted to three specific employee ranks: managerial employees, mid-level employees, and rank-and-file employees (including entrusted workers and dispatched workers from temporary agencies). We require all employees to attend such sessions at least once every three years.
Beginning with the theme of "Considering Both Sides of Responsibility (Considering Approaches to Self-management)," we confirm the importance of fulfilling our responsibility as leaders who are knowledgeable about a particular site by focusing on the original purpose of our business (such as research, development, manufacturing, or sales of high-quality products with a commitment to safety and security).
We then approach the theme of "Considering Both Sides of the Workplace Climate (Considering Approaches to Guiding Subordinates)." This concerns how to provide guidance to subordinates in day-to-day tasks. While clarifying the relationship between misconduct and corporate culture, we confirm our stance as a familiar and positive consultation partner capable of “drawing attention, knowing the background, addressing issues in a cool manner, and saying what one has to say.” We learn that such day-to-day words and actions help foster a good workplace culture.
Awareness Initiatives in the Workplace
Workplace training
In order to promote greater penetration and adoption of corporate ethics in the workplace, we conduct corporate ethics training sessions in various workplaces once every six months. These training sessions have become well established, as they offer opportunities for workplace discussion. They are based on a training program covering violations of corporate ethics and legal violations and the like that we created in reference to situations that actually arose in other companies.

In order to promote greater Group-wide penetration of the Group Mission "
— Providing affluence and comfort to people and society, with our unique technology," we published the "Group Corporate Ethics Guidebook" for our companies in Japan and distributed it to all their employees. This publication contains conduct guidelines, explanations, and frequently asked questions on practices to follow not only in routine tasks but also in private life. Its content is useful for raising the awareness of each employee regarding corporate ethics.
Awareness Activities on Our Corporate Ethics Portal

is a global chemical company, and boasts the world's top-class production capacity for acrylic acid and superabsorbent polymers. Acrylic acid was developed by establishing a method of propylene direct oxidation* – another world ﬁrst in 1970 – and a technology that has been widely adopted among leading overseas acrylic acid manufacturers. produces not only acrylic acid but also derivative products, such as acrylates and superabsorbent polymers. These products are used as raw materials for paints, adhesives, diapers and so on. Since they are in high demand, continues to operate its acrylic acid plants at full production capacity.
* An oxidation method in which propylene and oxygen are directly oxidi-zed via a catalyst
has been expanding its core businesses in superabsorbent polymers and acrylic acid globally, beginning with the establishment of a production base for the former in Tennessee, USA, in 1988. Today, with production bases in Japan, the US, Belgium, China, Indonesia, and Singapore, we provide a stable supply of the products on a global scale.
Superabsorbent polymers are used mainly in diapers. By drawing on the company's strengths such as its high product development capability, innovative manufacturing processes, in-house-manufactured raw materials and intellectual property strategy, boasts the world's top-level market share.
is Japanese for "catalyst." Catalysts are essential in the manufacture of chemical products; our name conveys the drive for growth through developing proprietary catalysts and reﬁning their capabilities.
The word ("Japan") in reﬂects our commitment to developing technologies in-house.
Whereas many chemical companies adopt technology from overseas, has focused on product development using proprietary technology since its founding.
As Shokubai's production processes are also developed in-house, it is proud of its manufacturing technology expertise, which constantly evolves through steady improvements made on the production ﬂoor.
Based on the direct oxidation of propylene, Shokubai's acrylic acid production technology is adopted over the world. Licensees of the technology include major acrylic acid manufacturers.
In 1985, began full-scale production of superabsorbent polymers at a plant with an annual capacity of 10,000 tons. With their application in diapers, its annual production capacity has grown to 710,000 tons over a quarter century later, and it continues to grow strongly.
In 2003, made a strategic decision to withdraw from the phthalic anhydride business, which had been a product since the company's founding, to concentrate on other areas. The company has since developed a structure that earns solid revenue from its core businesses in acrylic acid, superabsorbent polymers, and ethylene oxide.
We have been working from April 2014 on its long-term business plan and the 1st medium-term business plan which is the action plan for the initial three years. We have now formulated 2nd medium-term business plan "Reborn 2020 NEXT," which spans the period from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2020.
We reconfirm our intention to follow our corporate credo: "Safety takes priority over production," and we are making every effort to implement the preventive/corrective measures to avoid accidents. We believe that only through these actions will we be able to regain the confidence of stake holders as a chemical company.
We will deliver the products and services that provide affluence and comfort to people and society, and we will strive as a team to achieve the "Reborn Shokubai"—a company*) that everybody can be proud of.
*) company that promotes work safety and peace of mind
company that rewards people who make their best efforts and achieve results
company that people can be proud to work for.
The plan is designed to ensure safe, reliable production activities. The plan also highlights profitability over sales and acceleration of creating new businesses and products. During fiscal 2020, the final year of the plan, we aim to be in a position to prospect further strong Group growth for next ten years.

We will focus on technology in targeting major progress toward our  Vision for 2025.
Second president and key founding figure of  the Group, Taizo Yatagai, espoused the importance of  technology-driven management. True to that legacy, we contribute to society  based on our Group Mission: “
– Providing affluence and comfort to people and society, with our  unique technology.” Moreover, as expressed in our Corporate Credo, “Safety  takes priority over production,” safe and reliable operations remain the  cornerstone of our management. To foster even greater public trust as a  chemical company, we link all of our corporate activities to the UN’s  sustainable development goals (SDGs) and actively carry out initiatives to  honor our corporate social responsibility.
Primarily serving corporate customers, the  Group provides chemical products that create value in diverse  industries. Working largely behind the scenes, we nonetheless support many  industries and thus an affluent, comfortable society. You can rest assured that  we will continue to do so by leveraging our extensive portfolio of technologies  and our ability to develop new ones.
Our Vision for 2025 is to be “an innovative  chemical company that provides new value for people’s lives.” It guides us in  fulfilling our mission as we evolve in anticipation of a new era of change and  growth. We are also executing Reborn 2020 NEXT, our medium-term  business plan for the four years from fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2020. Sound  growth is the key to achieving the goals of the plan.  We are therefore concentrating on  strengthening existing businesses while taking on the challenge of sustainable  growth in new fields where we can leverage our strengths, including life  sciences, energy and environment, and ICT.
The Group will vigorously  pursue its Group Mission by accurately identifying the needs of society and  meeting them quickly with new products and services. As we do so, we look  forward to your continued understanding and support.
