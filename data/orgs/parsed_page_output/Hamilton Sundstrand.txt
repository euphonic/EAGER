Supplier Code of Conduct
 (translations available

If you believe your company is a match to our high ethical and compliance standards, the next step is to register! Our 
online registration system
 allows you to provide us with information about your business. You will receive an email confirmation after completing the registration process, and you will be contacted if there is a potential business opportunity.
Please note that registering is not a guarantee of future business, but does give your company exposure across and its businesses.

Advancing Education
To inspire students to embrace science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) studies, we support programs that spark students’ interest and inspire innovation. We provide financial and employee support to programs like the (For Inspiration and of Science and Technology) robotics competitions. Employees with engineering and other professional backgrounds serve as coaches and mentors to students as they design and build robots to compete in nationwide Robotics games.
Supporting Vibrant Communities
Giving that enhances the well-being of communities where our employees live and work encourages growth and vitality, and aids employee recruitment and retention. Our giving in this area focuses on community revitalization, health and human services, and arts and culture. We place a significant emphasis on United Way pledge campaigns, and the company and employees raise millions of dollars each year for local partner agencies.
Building Sustainable Cities
Sustainable building practices promote environmental responsibility in urban areas. We initiate and participate in programs such as Habitat for Humanity, in which employees and the donate their time, talent and treasure to build and refurbish homes in local areas. And we facilitate a Green Initiatives mini grant program in which employees nominate “green projects” and work with local non-profit partners to protect, beautify or enhance our neighborhoods.
Investing in Emerging Markets
As a global leader, we are committed to investing in the countries where we do business. For instance, our involvement with the United Way of India supports programs to improve communities there by focusing on education, health and livelihood. All around the world, we measure success with the same set of financial, operational, ethical, environmental and safety standards.
