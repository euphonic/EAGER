Making a Difference in our communities
To make a more meaningful impact on the communities where we live and work, Hologic supports other organizations that share our values and commitment to promoting healthier lives.
Our Philanthropic Focus

At Hologic, we center our giving efforts in two specific areas to maximize our impact in ways that align with the values of our employees and customers, as well as with what our company holds dear. For us, those areas are healthcare and education.
Many of our philanthropic healthcare efforts reflect our goal of championing women’s health globally.

This includes supporting organizations that provide life-saving and life-changing care, primarily for women.
Our efforts to promote education help foster the expertise and passion the world needs to support healthy lives for years to come.

With an emphasis on underprivileged groups, Hologic strives to support more opportunities for people to pursue education and careers in science, technology, engineering and math. We not only hope to help create fulfilling career opportunities, but also to continue building a robust pipeline of smart thinkers who will help solve the health issues of the future.
Unfortunately, Hologic is not able to support a variety of organizations, including but not limited to: non-accredited educational groups; for-profit organizations; religious, sectarian, political advocacy or lobbying groups; fraternal, athletic (including scholastic sports teams) or labor groups; individual scholarships, grants or memorials; requests for any expenses related to the purchase of Hologic products; arts and cultural organizations; or functions focused primarily on entertainment or recreation.

© Copyright 2019 Hologic Inc. All rights reserved.“Dancing with the Stars” host and cervical cancer survivor Erin Andrews fights to save lives 
Every two hours, one woman dies of cervical cancer.1 To change this stat, Hologic is partnering with sports reporter and host of “Dancing with the Stars,” Erin Andrews, to mobilize women to take control of their health and ensure they are being regularly tested for this preventable cancer.2*
“Even if you feel like you’re healthy and you’re busy, it’s so important to go to the doctor,” Andrews said in a recent interview with InStyle. “didn’t have any symptoms whatsoever, and was getting ready for football season. just went in for a normal exam and thought everything would be good to go.”
Following her routine annual exam in 2016, however, Erin was diagnosed with cervical cancer. Fortunately, her cancer was found early and was treated. Through the course of two surgeries, Erin kept working as a sports reporter, in part, she says, because immersing herself in work was one way to cope.
"That's where feel better is on the side lines," Andrews told Good Morning America. "could actually forget about it. It is where felt like this is me."
Now, as part of the Change This campaign, Erin hopes to help break down the barriers that stop women from getting tested for cervical cancer. 
“When came forward, it was right before the Super Bowl, and was literally on the field, and had 300-lb guys coming up to me saying, 'Thank you so much, I’ve had women in my life who have dealt with this,’” said Erin in an interview with “want men to feel comfortable to ask women if they've been checked. Everyone is now very comfortable speaking about breast cancer and prostate cancer, we need this to be part of the conversation as well."
In partnership with Hologic, Erin will advocate for women to get regularly tested for cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is not only treatable if caught early; it’s preventable.2* But approximately 8 million women ages 21 to 65 years old reported they had not been tested for cervical cancer in the last 5 years, and more than half of new cervical cancer cases occur in women who have never or rarely been tested.2,3 “If you’re not getting tested,” said Andrews, “you’re putting yourself at risk.”
“For more than 20 years, Hologic has been dedicated to improving women’s health and well-being through early detection,” said Tom West, president, Diagnostic Solutions division at Hologic. “Many insurance policies cover cervical cancer testing with no deductible and there are clinics across the country that provide testing at low or no cost. No matter the circumstances, women can and should get tested for this preventable cancer.”1† 
Hologic is the market-leading supplier in the United States of Pap tests and tests, frequently used together on the same sample to screen for cervical pre-cancer and cancer (known as Pap+Together or co-testing). According to guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, women ages 21-29 should get regular Pap testing, with co-testing being the preferred approach for women 30 to 65.4
*As many as 93% of cervical cancers could be prevented by screening and vaccination.2
†This means you may not be responsible for a co-pay, deductible or other out-of-pocket costs. Coverage may not be available to all women. Please consult your health plan for coverage.

✓Hologic rolls out SmartCurve™ system with the help of Grammy winner
It’s a new year, which means a renewed commitment from Hologic to continue serving as a breast health leader through the development of transformational technologies that improve women’s health and well-being via early detection and treatment.
This past October, Hologic recognized Breast Cancer Awareness Month by joining the conversation about the importance of routine breast cancer screening and how innovations like the Genius™ 3Mammography™ exam are helping turn the tides of breast cancer diagnoses through its clinically proven ability to detect 20% to 65% more invasive breast cancers compared to 2mammography alone.1 For the second year in a row, Hologic teamed up with Grammy Award-winner and breast cancer survivor Sheryl Crow to spread this message, as well as launch the Company’s latest innovation, the new SmartCurve breast stabilization system, which is designed to make the more accurate mammogram more comfortable.*ii
As a survivor, Crow understands firsthand the anxiety that can often accompany a mammogram, but she also stresses how crucial it is for women to make – and keep – their annual mammography appointments. 
“As a breast cancer survivor who is here today because my cancer was caught early during a routine mammogram, I'm passionate about sharing this incredible technology with everyone meet,” says Crow in a recent video she filmed for Breast Cancer Awareness Month. 
In another video that is making rounds in physician waiting rooms across the country, Crow hopes to help alleviate some of the stress women face as they await their mammograms by talking about the SmartCurve system. The fear of pain and/or discomfort during an exam are some of the most frequently cited reasons for patients skipping or delaying screening mammograms. Fortunately, with the SmartCurve system — standard on new 3Dimensions™ mammography systems from Hologic and available as an enhancement option to existing Hologic 3Mammography™ systems — a curved compression surface mirrors the shape of a woman’s breast to reduce pinching and allow uniform compression over the entire breast, with accommodations that can be made to fit a majority of women and breast sizes.2
In fact, the SmartCurve system improved comfort in the 93% of women surveyed who reported moderate to severe discomfort with standard compression.ii 
“With the introduction of the SmartCurve system, the Genius exam is now clinically proven to be a more comfortable mammogram, along with having the critical benefit of being the more accurate mammogram [compared to 2mammography alone],” says Pete Valenti, Hologic Division President, Breast and Skeletal Health Solutions.
Therefore, women can take comfort in knowing they will not only have a better exam experience, but they can also have peace of mind knowing they won’t be sacrificing image quality or accuracy as a result. 
“That means that we can feel more confident that our annual screening exam has a high probability of finding the really troubling cancers we want found, and that it’s less likely we will be called back for those anxiety-provoking false alarms,” Crow adds in her patient video.
Crow’s work with Hologic will continue through 2018, as she continues to lend her voice through Hologic marketing materials and promotional videos to encourage women to be proactive about their health and well-being by scheduling a Genius™ exam.

✓Angie Morrow dealt with the pain, discomfort and inconvenience of uterine fibroids for years, including menstrual periods so heavy she was forced to use the bathroom every half hour. She handled interruptions to her work and personal life and the frustration of doctors who never offered a solution.
It wasn’t until the growths in her uterus jeopardized her chances of having a baby that she learned what fibroids were and what she could do to get rid of them. 
Angie and her husband, Todd, had a 6-year-old boy named Ryan who, at age 2, was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Duchenne is a fatal disease that causes severe muscle degeneration and weakness, usually beginning between ages 3 and 5. 
As Angie puts it, “Physically, he’s a lot weaker than his classmates. He can’t jump but he tries, he gets tired a lot easier, and so his muscles always hurt. Kind of like the way we feel after we run a long distance, that's how he feels all the time.”
The couple were ready to have another baby, but they learned there was a 50% chance the child would also be born with Duchenne. They turned to in vitro fertilization, a process through which their doctor could select healthy eggs without the Duchenne gene, fertilize them and transfer the embryos to Angie’s uterus. 
Unfortunately, fibroids can impact the chances of successful embryo implantation, so Angie’s fibroids needed to be removed before the 
Minimally invasive and typically done on an outpatient basis, the MyoSure procedure proved successful and played a part in Angie’s doctor’s treatment plan, which eventually made it possible for her to give birth to a healthy baby boy, Jacob. 
Todd works at Hologic, so the Morrows knew about the MyoSure procedure. After speaking with her doctor, Angie decided to try it. Minimally invasive and typically done on an outpatient basis, the MyoSure procedure proved successful and played a part in her doctor’s successful treatment plan, which eventually made it possible for Angie to give birth to a healthy baby boy, Jacob.
“We’re finding as time goes on, Jacob is becoming a bigger part of Ryan’s life, and we hope and pray that he will be his best friend and someone there for him,” Todd says. “This was the first time in 25 years in medical device manufacturing that ever had a device that was close to being my responsibility actually touch my family’s life.”

While she had received routine Pap tests during regular gynecologist visits, Amy wasn’t screened for (human papillomavirus), the most common sexually transmitted infection linked with 99% of cervical cancers.1
Many physicians screen for cervical cancer by conducting either a Pap test or an test. Pap test detects cervical disease on the cervix, and an test screens for the presence of the virus. But nearly 1-in-5 cancers (18.6%) are missed by HPV-alone* and 12.2% of cancers are missed by Pap alone.2
That’s why Pap+Together™ is the preferred screening method for women aged 30 to 65, identifying more precancer than either test alone and missing far fewer cancers.3,4
Today, having overcome a cancer that kills over 4,000 women each year, Amy has become a fierce advocate for cervical health.5 She encourages more women to talk to their doctors about cervical cancer screening and the tests that are best for them. She raises awareness about the benefits of screening in addition to the Pap test to detect high-risk HPV, which can raise the risk for cervical cancer.6 
So other women don’t have to experience what she went through, Amy promotes Pap+Together, when appropriate. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that cervical disease screening should include:
For women 21-29 years old, a Pap test every 3 years.4
For women 30-65 years old, a Pap test with an test (also known as co-testing) every 5 years.4
Thanks to cervical cancer survivors like Amy Rodriguez and women who speak up to their doctors about their cervical health, we’re on our way to preventing cervical cancer worldwide.
*positive screening result may lead to further evaluation with cytology and/or colposcopy.

✓Aisha Tyler Interview
Aisha Tyler Joins the Fight to End Silence Around Heavy Periods
Actress and television host Aisha Tyler is encouraging women to advocate for their health by partnering with Hologic to overcome the stigma preventing millions of women from discussing their heavy periods.
One in five women suffer from heavy periods,1 yet many wait years to seek a diagnosis and treatment.2 As part of Hologic’s We Hate Heavy Periods™ initiative, Aisha is helping break the silence around heavy periods, through an earned and social media campaign as well as video content aimed at encouraging women to have open and honest conversations with their doctors about their periods.
"Women are more empowered and outspoken than ever before, yet many still don't speak up on their own behalf when it comes to their personal health," Aisha said. "One in five women live with heavy periods that affect their quality of life, relationships and careers, and many don't know they can do something about it.”
Heavy periods can be characterized by bleeding that lasts longer than seven days or includes passing clots the size of a quarter or larger.1 Many women suffering from heavy periods experience severe cramping, clotting, nausea, exhaustion and anemia as a result, which can negatively impact quality of life.2 Despite the prevalence of heavy periods, some women are either not aware they are experiencing a condition for which they can receive treatment or are hesitant to seek treatment out of fear that invasive surgery is the only option.
“At Hologic, we recognize that simply providing an effective treatment for heavy periods is not enough – we must also do our part in educating women about the condition and their options, so they seek the solution that is right for them,” said Sean Daugherty, President of the Surgical Solutions division at Hologic.
Video content featuring Aisha includes interviews with several women about their periods, as well as a sit-down discussion with Cindy Basinski, MD, a board-certified urogynecologist in Indiana, to discuss heavy periods and the treatment options available. Ultimately, the videos aim to educate and drive viewers to www.wehateheavyperiods.com , where they can learn more about heavy periods and treatment options, including the Hologic-manufactured NovaSure® procedure, a one-time, five-minute surgical procedure that aims to reduce or stop menstrual bleeding in women who are finished with child-bearing.
“This is really about women living their best life and empowering themselves,” Aisha said in a recent media interview with talk show host Wendy Williams . “If you have abnormal uterine bleeding, there is something you can do that is not hormonal therapy and is not as extreme as getting a hysterectomy.”

✓Whether you’re a professional athlete or an ordinary person—body composition (how much muscle and fat you have and, importantly, how they’re distributed in your body) is key to human performance, which includes strength, power and agility.
That’s why a precise measurement is so essential, says Jacob Wilson, Ph.(in skeletal muscle physiology), and and director of the Applied Science and Performance Institute, a research and performance facility in Tampa, Fla., that works with elite athletes as well as with the general population. “DXA1 by Hologic gives the highest resolution when it comes to body composition,” Dr. Wilson says, “so we’re confident that its measurement is correct.”
For his work with professional athletes, Dr. Wilson says the system—which measures fat mass, bone mass and lean mass—sets an accurate baseline for where they are when they’re first scanned. Then, subsequent scans measure progress leading to improved performance.
For example, hockey players ideally want a lot of lean mass around the hip area, not only on the upper body. If the scan shows the opposite, Dr. Wilson says that will affect their game. “The hips are powerful muscles for exploding and having high speed on the ice,” he says. Once armed with the scan results, Dr. Wilson can redesign an athlete’s exercise regimen to build mass and decrease body fat to optimize performance.
“takes the guesswork out of what need to do to help these athletes become the best they can be,” he says.
For everyday individuals, the system’s benefits are equally important. The scan will indicate whether a person has poor muscle function or is at risk of fracture due to low bone density, among other things. If it’s poor muscle function, for instance, Dr. Wilson says he’ll follow up by asking about lifestyle, diet and how active or sedentary they are. From there he’ll know how he can help that person not only reduce its negative impact, but prevent it from getting worse.
“For health or fitness professionals interested in helping people slow or even avoid these and other age-related conditions, is crucial” he says.
“In science,” adds Dr. Wilson, whose extensive research has covered the cellular, molecular and whole-body changes in muscle size, strength and power in response to novel products, training and nutrition interventions, “we’re always trying to get better resolutions, always trying to better understand the human body.” Available data from massive studies that look at body composition in obese people and physically challenged people across age spans, irrespective of who’s creating body composition databases, he notes, is based largely on the scans Hologic has done. “That’s one of the biggest reasons to say Hologic is backed by science,” he adds.
For Dr. Wilson, himself a leading innovator in the field of human performance, Hologic is the leading innovator in measuring body composition, continually making improvements in terms of resolution, science and user-friendliness.
“Most companies move at a crawl,” he says. “Hologic is moving at light speed, and that’s very exciting.” The truth is, he adds, “we have a 21,000-square-foot performance facility here with all the technology in the world, yet virtually every time we analyze someone, we use the Hologic It’s an increasingly critical component of enhancing human performance.”
