was founded in 2003. The company’s original high performance, radio-frequency receiver products capture and process digital and analog broadband signals for applications including terrestrial, cable and satellite television and broadband. These products include both receivers and receiver systems-on-chip, or SoCs, which incorporate highly integrated radio system architecture and demodulator technology. The company’s products were based on its pioneering low power, low cost process technology.
In 2015, the company acquired Entropic, the world leader in semiconductor solutions for the connected home. Entropic pioneered multimedia over coax (MoCA) home networking technology. The company’s technology transforms how traditional broadcast and streaming video is seamlessly, reliably, and securely delivered, processed, and distributed into and throughout the home.
also offers optical networking driver and trans-impedance amplifier ICs for 100/ 400optical data center networks. The devices use advanced technology that cut in half the number of channels needed in optical transmission modules, reducing power consumption, size and cost for 100Gbps and 400Gbps networks.
technology is trusted by leading telephone, cable and satellite operators, set-top box manufacturers, networking equipment providers and consumer technology providers.
