Our History
In 1885, long before anyone talks about carbon footprints or climate change, Warren launches a to explore new ways to harness and conserve precious energy resources. In doing so, he also launches a tradition of customer-focused innovation—a tradition that has inspired thousands of employees for more than 130 years and that continues to drive the success of Controls. Even before he founds the firm now known as Controls, Warren is the quintessential inventor. His pneumatic tower clocks, electric storage batteries, wireless telegraph business and steam-powered luxury cars and postal service trucks anticipate—and shape—the future.

1885–1910:
The Spirit of Invention
In the age of Edison, Bell, Daimler, Pasteur, Tesla and Ericsson, anything seems possible. It’s an era of firsts: electric lights, internal combustion engines, X-rays and hydroelectric power plants.
Against this backdrop, Warren toils for three years to invent a device to regulate room temperature. In 1883, he receives his first patent for what will be known as the electric room thermostat—an invention that launches an industry and changes how people live. Within two years, his quickly growing Electric Service brings evenly regulated temperatures to buildings around the world.

Wanvig, the first president of Globe-Union, is born
Dec. 7, 1890
On December 7, 1890, Chester Odin Wanvig, the first president of Globe-Union (the ancestor to Controls' Power Solutions Business Unit), was born in Milwaukee.  Chester's father was John Wanvig, a Norwegian immigrant who was widely known as a master of ships which plied the Great Lakes.  As a boy, Chester worked his way up from deckhand to wheelsman on his father's coal and ore ship, and also sold newspapers.  He went on to attend the Michigan College of Mines at Houghton for a time, but left to clerk at a steel company.  At the age of 20, Chester became general manager and secretary of the Wallace Smith Co., then the nation's largest manufacturer of saddlery.  After gaining financial control of the company, he liquidated it in the early 1920s and subsequently purchased (with his brother) the Globe Electric Company.  Globe's 1925 purchase of Central Radio Laboratories (later known as Centralab) proved fortuitous in that it immediately preceded the radio craze that would sweep America.  Also, about this time, Wanvig formed Union Battery to serve as a supplier to Sears.  In 1929, the assets of Globe Electric and Union Battery were consolidated and the Globe-Union Manufacturing was organized.  Automotive batteries came to represent Globe's major success, much of which was owed to Globe's engineers and their patented equipment and processes.  Under Wanvig, growth continued apace, with sales of batteries, Centralab electronic components, roller skates, and spark plugs reaching $50 million by 1955.  Wanvig was president of Globe-Union until 1949, chairman of the board from 1949 to 1953, and from 1954 to 1958 he served as both board chairman and president.  Upon Wanvig's retirement in 1958, his son, Chester Wanvig, Jr., became president of Globe-Union.  Wanvig, Jr. was still at the helm of Globe-Union in 1978 when it was acquired by Controls.

Nov. 6, 1847
On November 6, 1847, Warren Seymour Johnson, the founder of Controls, was born to Charles and Emeline in Leicester, Vermont.  Two years later, the family boarded a sailing vessel in Buffalo, New York, bound for Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  The family settled first in Waukesha and, later, to homesteads in central and northern Wisconsin.  By some accounts, had a harsh childhood, marked by the death of his mother in 1855.  He received little formal schooling, but acquired a self-taught education from books, observation, and experimentation.  In a precursor to his later career as an inventor, kept a book in which he sketched and described a number of inventions in the fields of chemistry, electricity, and mechanics.  As a young man, worked on his father's farm and in the lumber mills of northern Wisconsin.  He also learned the printer's trade and, at the age of 17, secured the position of foreman in the office of the Lean Wolf, a Durand, Wisconsin, newspaper.  In the next 10 years of his life, worked as a surveyor and school teacher.  Eventually, he became the Superintendent of Schools for New Lisbon, Wisconsin in 1874.  In 1877, took a position as a professor of mathematics, sciences and drawing at the State Normal School in Whitewater, Wisconsin.  During his teaching tenure there, he came up with his idea for regulating temperature in buildings through the use of thermostats - an idea upon which he founded this in 1885.

Oct. 20, 1902
Upon conclusion of the Service (Controls' former name) board meeting on Oct. 20, 1902, the directors decided to inspect the construction of the company's new headquarters being built on the southeast corner of Jefferson and Michigan streets in downtown Milwaukee.  Of particular interest to them was the selection of exterior brick.  Their first choice of brick had not yet come in after two months' wait, so the board took action.  According to the minutes, " ... after inspecting several different kinds, a light shade of red pressed brick submitted by Rickertson & Schwarz was selected, the price to be $15 dollars per thousand."  Subsequent buildings erected around the original headquarters are of the same color brick, making the an easily recognizable presence in today's downtown Milwaukee - not bad for a brick that came in second place.

Sept. 5, 1958
On Sept. 5, 1958, Globe-Union, Inc. (predecessor to today's Power Solutions group) produced its 50 millionth battery for Sears, Roebuck & Co. Then Sears President Charles Kellstadt and other Sears officers were present when the 50 millionth battery (bearing a special coat of gold paint) was taken from the production line at Globe's Milwaukee manufacturing plant. After photo ops, the commemorative battery (accompanied by Miss Milwaukee of 1958, Carmen Shields) was transported in an antique automobile to Milwaukee's Mitchell Field.  From there it was flown to Detroit (the "Motor City"), where it was to be placed on permanent display at a Sears store.  Globe began making automotive batteries for Sears in 1927 - today, Power Solutions continues to supply batteries to Sears. Pictured from left, Shields, Kellstadt and Globe-Union president Wanvig, Sr., as they admire the 50 millionth battery.

Service and York help put man on the moon
Aug. 15, 1965
On Aug. 15, 1965, the trade journal Contractor announced "Moonport Takes 10,000-Ton Air Conditioning System."  The "moonport" referred to in the article was the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) under construction at the Kennedy Space Center in Merritt Island, Florida (shown in ad from 1965).  The was built to vertically assemble the stages of the Saturn rocket for the Apollo program, the project that eventually landed the first man on the surface of the moon in July 1969.  At the time, this was the largest building in the world by volume at 129 million cubic feet (for comparison, the Pentagon is 77 million cubic feet in volume).  The 525 foot high, single-story structure's interior was so large, in fact, that it was feared that rain clouds might form at the top of it without proper environmental control.  Service Co. (Controls' former name) and York were involved in overcoming the unique challenges posed in providing the proper climate needed for precision assembly of several-stories-high rockets.  York supplied the four 2,500-ton "Turbomaster" water chilling units at the heart of the building's air conditioning system, while installed the pneumatic climate controls.  Until recently, the was used for the preparation of the Space Shuttle for launch; in the future, the will be used to prepare commercial launch vehicles, and for NASA's new Space Launch System.

July 29, 1896
On July 29, 1896, the York Manufacturing Co. (York) completed construction of its new plant in York, Pennsylvania.  York, founded in 1874 and acquired by in 2005, had originally occupied a two-story building on Penn Street in downtown York.  Its first products were washing machines, turbine water wheels, corn planters and cultivators, and shaft pulleys and hangers.  However, most of the company's early revenue came from machine repairs - not equipment sales.  By 1885, the young had entered the field of ice and refrigerating machines, which after some initial tough times, would prove where the would find success.  In 1893, the purchased land and buildings in west York near the Northern Central Railway in order to expand and modernize its factory production.  After receiving architect Dempwolf's plant designs, president Phillip Glatfelter realized that the had insufficient capital to carry them through to completion.  In order to raise the necessary funds to construct the factory, Glatfelter decided to incorporate the in 1895.  Work on the new plant was begun on July 13, 1895.  However, the expense of the new plant and equipment, along with lagging sales, and a severe national economic depression, caused another financial crisis for the in 1896 - which was only resolved with the hiring of Thomas Shipley to manage the in 1897.  Shipley, who had built his reputation in the refrigeration machine business at the Frick Company, instituted a number of changes that soon put York on the path to becoming an industry leader.

June 21, 1939
On June 21, 1939, Olav, the crown prince of Norway, visited Globe-Union, Inc.'s (the predecessor of today's Power Solutions business unit) Milwaukee battery manufacturing facilities during his tour.  Prince Olav came at the invitation of Globe president Chester Wanvig, himself a proud Norwegian-American who had donated generously to charitable causes in Norway.  And whatever became of Olav?  Well, it took almost 20 years from the time of his Milwaukee visit for the man who would be king to actually become king (in 1957), a role that he served until his death in 1991 at the age of 87.  Nicknamed the "People's King," his passing prompted a great outpouring of grief by the Norwegian people, who lit hundreds of thousands of candles in memoriam in the courtyard outside the Royal Castle in Oslo. (Norway's Prince Olav and Princess Martha are pictured attending a concert in Milwaukee during their June 1939 visit.)

May 1, 1885
The first board meeting of the Electric Service (Controls' original name) took place in the office of Milwaukee financier William Plankinton in the Plankinton Hotel on Friday, May 1, 1885.  The incorporators and original stockholders were Plankinton, who was named president; Warren Johnson, who was named vice president and treasurer (while would serve as day-to-day manager, he would not be named president until 1901); and Captain Irving Bean, who was named secretary.  They had filed incorporation papers several days earlier, on April 20.  The charter was to "manufacture, sell, and deal in electric and pneumatic apparatus, and to construct and apply the same to public and private buildings in order to regulate temperature ... ."  At the meeting, assigned his patents to the and agreed to assign all future patents in the field of temperature regulation to the as well.  As to finances, the capital stock of the was $150,000 - 3,000 shares at $50 each.  Plankinton contributed the total capital amount of $150,000, for which he received joint ownership in Warren Johnson's patents and 1,499 shares.  also received 1,499 shares, with the remaining two shares going to Irving Bean.

Czech ambassador's visit
April 17, 1996
Michael Žantovský, the Czech Republic's ambassador to the United States (pictured, left), discussed his country's future with management during a visit to Milwaukee, Wis. on April 17, 1996.  Žantovský stressed his country's stability, stating "we have the most stable environment of all the post-communist countries.  There has been extensive privatization, coupled with a relaxation of trade and economic regulations.  Our currency is strong, the economy is growing steadily and there is a solid influx of foreign investment."  James Keyes, Controls' and chairman at that time (pictured on the right), agreed with Žantovský's comments and promised to expand the company's presence there.

Airport installations
March 29, 1983
An article about system installations in airports in the and abroad was featured in the March 29, 1983 edition of "Briefing," a newsletter for managers.  One such installation was at Heathrow - London's well-known airport.  Systems Limited used an 8001 (see photo) building automation system for the Heathrow project.  Earlier in 1983, had been awarded a full systems and services contract for work on the 1984 Olympics-related expansion of the Los Angeles International Airport.  Other airport projects at that time included those in Zürich, Switzerland; Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; Frankfurt and Düsseldorf, West Germany; and the Schiphol airport in Amsterdam.

Feb. 20, 1938
"Recessions bring good business for Globe-Union, Inc., in roller skates …" states the caption for this photograph published in the Milwaukee News-Sentinel from Feb. 20, 1938.  According to Globe (which was acquired by in 1978), roller skate sales increased in hard economic times (this was the Great Depression era) as families sought more inexpensive forms of recreation.  Globe began manufacturing roller skates in 1931 at its Milwaukee plant (where this photograph was taken) as a means to maintain employment of workers subject to seasonal lay-offs in its other divisions.
By the early 1950s, the had become one of the nation's top three makers of roller skates.  Production eventually moved to a new suburban Milwaukee facility in 1962.  Three years later (1965), Globe sold its roller skate manufacturing operations to the Aluminum Specialty of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, indicating at the time that roller skate manufacturing no longer fit with its other product lines (e. g., batteries).

Jan. 7, 1925
Controls' international activity in its first 40 years was not confined strictly to the European continent and Asia.  In fact, one early Service (Controls’ former name) installation occurred in South Africa.  drawing dated Jan. 7, 1925 and depicting the "layout of automatic control of refrigerating plant" was completed for the customer Dowson & Dobson of Johannesburg, South Africa.  The firm still exists in South Africa to this day; it is now known as & Industrial, a member of the Actum Group.View Our Brands
