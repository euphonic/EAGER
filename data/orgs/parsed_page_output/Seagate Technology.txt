Maximize Your Membership Benefits by Progressing Through Tier Levels
Both and LaCie Insider offer a wide range of benefits across four tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. The membership tier that your company qualifies for is based on the point-of-sale data provided us by Seagate- and LaCie-authorized
        distributors and depends on purchase volume and the assigned point value for the eligible products purchased. Your tier status will be evaluated daily for upgrade possibilities and then again at the close of each earning period to ensure the optimal
        fit for your account status.
