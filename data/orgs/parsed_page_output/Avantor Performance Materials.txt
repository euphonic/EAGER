History
Avantor® was formed in August 2010 when New Mountain Capital purchased it from Covidien Inc.; however, the company has been in existence for more than 110 years.
John Townsend Baker
The company now known as was founded in 1904 by John Townsend (J.T.) Baker.
Baker was studying chemistry at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, when he realized that the laboratory chemicals he was using in class were not sufficiently pure to facilitate accurate results. He decided to take matters into his own hands. In 1904, he founded the Baker Chemical Company along the Delaware River near the border of New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
The mission of the Baker Chemical Company was to produce chemicals of the "highest degree of purity commercially available."
Global Evolution
When it was founded in 1904, the Baker Chemical Company employed 20 individuals in Phillipsburg, New Jersey. Today, has operations throughout the world and is the global supplier of ultra-high-purity for the life sciences and advanced technology markets.
While the company has grown its manufacturing capabilities, product portfolio and global reach, our goal of providing high-quality to our customers around the world has not changed.
