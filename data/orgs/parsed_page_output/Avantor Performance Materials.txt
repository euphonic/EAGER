The mission of the Baker Chemical Company was to produce chemicals of the "highest degree of purity commercially available."

 Management of change program 
Change is a constant in today’s global manufacturing environment. We help you stay in control of changing situations and minimize risks associated with changes to manufacturing processes for our life sciences materials, and put key information into the right hands with our comprehensive Management of Change (MOC) program.
How Avantor's program works
Conditions that may be subject to change are proactively identified by Avantor's team of experts 
Associated risks are evaluated and key staff in your organization are notified, per procedure 
Information on what level of change control is communicated for impacted raw 
Information to select the appropriate grade of product for each application is provided, so you know exactly what change notification procedures will be involved
Our products are classified under change control tiers to ensure you always get the notification you need for each specific product. You will receive Change Notification communications from if you have enrolled in Avantor’s Management of Change (MOC) program or you have purchased an impacted product directly from within the past three years.
