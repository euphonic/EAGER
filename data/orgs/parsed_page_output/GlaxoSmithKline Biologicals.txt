About us
Vaccines
Vaccines
Our Vaccines business has a broad portfolio and innovative pipeline of vaccines to protect people of all ages. We deliver over two million vaccine doses per day to people living in over 160 countries.
The vaccines in our portfolio have been helping to protect people from serious disease for well over 100 years, with our Marietta (US) site dedicated to smallpox vaccine production since 1882.  Today, our vaccines continue to tackle some of the world’s most devastating diseases, including pneumococcal disease, meningitis, hepatitis, rotavirus, whooping cough and influenza.
View video on YouTube
Our Vaccines business has a portfolio of more than 40 vaccines for every stage of life, helping to protect people against 22 diseases. We have a pipeline of 14 candidate vaccines in development. One third of our vaccines in development target diseases particularly prevalent in the developing world, including all three infectious disease priorities: HIV, malaria and Our other vaccines in development include vaccines for the treatment of and prevention of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV). In October 2017, our shingles vaccine, Shingrix, received regulatory approval in Canada and the US.
The business generated sales of £5.2 billion in 2017, representing 17% of the total turnover of the Group.
Our marketplace 
Vaccination is recognised worldwide as one of the best investments that any government or healthcare organisation can make. In 2012, the and its 194 member’s states published an action plan on vaccination to extend access to immunization to everyone in the world, promote innovation in the vaccines industry and prevent millions of deaths.
This plan involves more equitable access to existing vaccines for people in all communities, the introduction of new and improved vaccines and accelerated research and development for the next generation of vaccines and technologies. Overall, this should translate into a growing global demand for vaccines over the next 10-15 years.
For example, more than 25 million children are born every year in India alone and it’s estimated that by 2020 there will be more than a billion people in the world aged over 60.
Fighting malaria
and Comic Relief: Joining forces to fight malaria.
Comic Relief and form a partnership to fight malaria 
Our strategy
Our strategy is to bring differentiated, high-quality, and needed vaccines to as many people as possible.
To do this we focus on creating a strong patient and payer focused pipeline, maintaining valuable partnerships with our local operating countries, and ensuring sustainable access and affordability. 
70%
of our vaccines go to emerging markets
$12bn
Malaria related illnesses and mortality estimated by to cost Africa's economy up to $12bn a year
Quality and manufacturing
In 2017, we sold more than 798 million doses of vaccine around the world. These are made in one of our 16 manufacturing sites located around the world. For some of our vaccines, this production process can take up to two years.
On average, each batch of vaccine will have undergone more than 100 quality checks before it is sent out, to ensure the vaccines meet world-class standards. Each of our vaccines is produced to the same quality standard, regardless of where in the world the vaccine will be used. 
We are continuously investing in our manufacturing facilities, improving our processes and building partnerships to ensure we meet the global growing needs for high quality vaccines.
Research and collaboration
Innovation is the beating heart of our business. Without it, there will be no new vaccines for the many diseases that still threaten individuals, families and communities around the world.
Our R&organisation brings together expertise in virology, bacterial infection and different adjuvant platforms.  We now have three global R&hubs: Rockville, (new in 2015); Rixensart, Belgium and Siena, Italy, which are focused on discovering and developing novel vaccines across a range of pressing public health threats. Our efforts are concentrated on those possible vaccines which may offer significant improvements over existing options or target diseases for which no vaccines yet exist. 
Our approach is to make the most of our own expertise and experience, while at the same time forming complementary partnerships and alliances with others who bring different kinds of expertise. Our vision for the world, where everyone has access to the vaccines they need, depends on a steady supply of great ideas and brilliant science. We have much to offer and through collaboration we can achieve so much more.
For example, more than 90% of the vaccines in our pipeline are being developed in partnership with others. We have a long track record of collaborating with governments, healthcare providers, regulators, academic institutions, non-governmental organisations, vaccine producers and other key partners to tackle public health challenges around the world.

View video on YouTube
Our Pharmaceuticals business has a broad portfolio of innovative and established medicines. We currently focus on developing new medicines in respiratory and HIV/infectious diseases, oncology and immuno-inflammation; with discovery research exploring these and other areas.
The business generated sales of £17.3 billion in 2017, representing 57% of the total turnover of the Group.
The business is made up of innovative and established medicines and holds leading market positions in respiratory disease and In our Pharmaceuticals R&organisation, almost 80% of research spending focuses on two current therapy areas: respiratory and HIV/infectious diseases; and two potential areas: oncology and immuno-inflammation.
Our marketplace
The global pharmaceuticals market is vast. The remains a priority market for growth with other key growth areas including emerging markets and Asia Pacific regions. 
This trend of increasing demand is expected to continue as the world’s population grows, economies in the emerging markets become more prosperous and global changes in lifestyles affect long-term health.
Our strategy
Janet Liberty, an patient
Our strategy is to research and produce innovative, high-quality and needed medicines; making these as accessible as possible to countries at all levels of income and development. 
To do this we focus on creating a strong differentiated pipeline, leading in and respiratory, and developing our presence in speciality therapy areas, including oncology and immuno-inflammation. 
Our Pharmaceuticals portfolio
Our portfolio is made up of innovative and established medicines and we have leading global positions in respiratory disease and HIV.
We have been a leader in respiratory disease for over 40 years and have a portfolio of mature products. In recent years, we have strengthened and broadened our respiratory portfolio with the addition of new medicines including an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) combination, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) and dual bronchodilator.
Our business is managed through ViiHealthcare, a global specialist company in that we majority own, with Pfizer and Shionogi as shareholders. ViiHealthcare is now a leading global company in and has had significant recent success with regulatory approval and industry leading launches of new medicines. ViiHealthcare has a number of other antiretroviral medicines in clinical development.
In addition to respiratory and HIV, we have a portfolio of other innovative pharmaceutical products for the treatment of conditions such as lupus, urology and anti-infectives.  
We also have an Established Products Portfolio (EPP) which includes mature medicines in the areas of anti-infectives, allergy, central nervous system, dermatology, respiratory and urology. These products are an important part of our Emerging Markets business where the brand is an important differentiator.
The journey to discovering and developing new medicines is lengthy, expensive and subject to a high rate of failure. Learn more about 
how we discover new medicines
. 
We are exploring different approaches to promote – and speed up – innovation in our labs.  Having broken down the traditional, R&model, our scientists now work in smaller units focused on specific areas of research. This encourages greater entrepreneurialism and accountability. These groups are tasked with seeking out the biological targets involved in disease and creating molecules or biopharmaceuticals that will ultimately become new medicines. 
We also know that we won’t discover everything inside our own labs and that we need to partner with other companies, academic institutions and research charities.  We currently have research collaborations with more than 1,500 external organisations.
We also recognise our responsibility to meet society’s expectations to invest in disease areas where the science is difficult or where the typical business model to reward innovation may not be relevant; one example being our 
antibiotics research
. We are also one of the few healthcare companies researching the World Health Organization’s three priority diseases - HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.
Other business areas
Vaccines
Our Vaccines business has a broad portfolio and innovative pipeline of vaccines to protect people of all ages. We deliver over two million vaccine doses per day to people living in over 160 countries.
Consumer Healthcare
Our Consumer Healthcare business develops and markets consumer preferred and expert recommended brands in the Oral health, Pain relief, Respiratory, Nutrition/gastro-intestinal and Skin health categories.
