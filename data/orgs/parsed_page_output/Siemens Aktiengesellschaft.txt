Our innovation history
We have a 120-year track record of industry firsts. View our Global History.
First industrially manufactured medical X-ray unit
Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen discovers X-rays in November 1895. Both our legacy companies & Halske and Reiniger, Gebbert & Schall recognize the potential of this new technology for the field of medicine and start producing the first industrially manufactured X-ray systems. The one pictured above is the Röntgeneinrichtung (X-ray unit) by & Halske from 1896.
1956
– first ever dry chemistry testing for glucose in urine
Our predecessor company Miles launches the first ever test strips called The new method proves to be simpler, more reliable, and faster than previous ways of testing for diabetes: results are available in 10 seconds. Soon the dip-and-read method becomes the preferred way for rapid testing and expands use to other conditions. Today, it is still the standard way to gain an overview when a patient presents with many symptoms.
With the help of their team, chemist Helen Murray and biochemist Alfred Free develop Their invention heavily impacts the further development of both laboratory diagnostics and point-of-care testing.

1957
AutoAnalyzer – fully automated discrete chemistry analyzer for whole blood or serum
The AutoAnalyzer accomplishes in one night what took lab technicians days. It consists of mechanical appliances, dialysis and analysis devices  − and a key innovation: The blood samples flow through the system continuously because they are separated by air bubbles. Deemed the prototype of all large central lab analysis systems, the AutoAnalyzer remains one of the most used automatic lab systems throughout the 1980s.
When biochemist Leonard Tucker Skeggs watches colleagues analyze blood samples by hand, he wonders: Can this be faster? Skeggs develops the first AutoAnalyzer prototype working at night in his home workshop. He creates one of the largest milestones in lab automatization.

1967
Vidoson – world’s first real-time ultrasound scanner
Having passed clinical tests in 1965/66, the world’s first real-time ultrasound imaging system comes to the market in 1967 under the name Vidoson. From this time on, ultrasound makes its way into hospitals and private practices as a diagnostic imaging method.
German engineer Richard Soldner (shown in the picture) and physicist Heinz Kresse begin developing this ultrasound system in the early 1960s.
1975
– our first scanner
1974, we exhibit our first tomographic image of a human head at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America in Chicago. year later, we introduce SIRETOM, our first computed tomography (CT) scanner for the brain. typical examination takes less than six minutes. The X-ray tube and a detector unit scan the skull from various directions, and an image of absorption distribution in the brain is generated in the computer.
In 1972, we set up a dedicated development department in Germany. Its founding fathers Friedrich Gudden, Gerhard Linke, Karlheinz Pauli, Benedikt Steinle, and Reiner Lieberuth develop the first scanner and grow the department steadily over the coming years.
1983
– first scanner
After years of R&work, we present MAGNETOM, our first commercial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. That summer, the system is installed for the first time in the and Germany. With the aid of powerful magnetic fields, scanners produce high-quality cross-sectional images without exposing patients to radiation. The sectional images display tissues and organs more clearly than ever before.
From 1978 on, a team led by Alexander Ganssen (r.) and Arnulf Oppelt develops the scanner. The left picture shows Oppelt in front of the 0.1 Tesla prototype. The unit Tesla measures the magnetic field strength. Today, our MRIs in clinical use have of up to seven Tesla.
1986
Stable acridinium ester based chemiluminescence immunoassays
We invent the first stable acridinium ester based chemiluminescence molecule. Our acridinium ester is non-radioactive, stable, highly-sensitive. It is first used in commercial immunoassays in 1986. The acridinium ester molecule is very versatile, mainly because of its small size. Today, we hold about 40 patents on innovative acridinium ester molecules for advanced diagnostics of heart, liver, and thyroid disease.
1998
Our first track-based laboratory automation system ADVIA® Automation connects multiple laboratory analyzers in a single, consolidated, high-volume workstation. The fully automated system allows for multiple testing disciplines like clinical chemistry, immunoassay, hematology, hemostasis, coagulation and urinalysis and requires less sample tubes for analysis.
In 1997, the development team begins to apply the principle of CentraLink® Data Management System, which consolidates data from multiple analyzers, to sample management on track-based automation. The system is first installed in Regensburg, Germany in late 1998.
1999
syngo – first intuitive medical platform from Developed in 1999, the image processing software syngo facilitates medical examinations by providing a single user interface for a large number of imaging systems, like X-ray devices or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners. The software is used in hospitals and medical practices to generate and post-process images. It integrates patient-specific physiological and imaging data into clinical workflows.
From 1994 onwards, a dedicated team works on the development of a completely new platform for medical imaging. Computer scientist Karlheinz Dorn is the chief architect of syngo.
2001
In our innovative hybrid system Biograph, we combine positron emission tomography (PET) with computed tomography (CT): scanner visualizes biological processes of life while an integrated system provides millimeter-precise anatomical images of tissues and organs. When they come together they reveal the complete picture: detailed anatomy and biological function at the molecular level.
Engineer Andres Sommer develops Biograph in collaboration with the team in Knoxville, TN, USA.
2005
Definition – world’s first Dual Source scanner
Two X-ray sources and detectors in one system: With twice the scanning power, we set new standards in image quality, scan speed, and spectral imaging. Dual Source technology enables the validation of coronary angiography with the potential to reduce the need to artificially lower the heart rate. Clinicians can now image the heart without motion artifacts at high heart rates or in cases of arrhythmia.
The “birth” of our Dual Source technology involves a team of dedicated physicists and engineers: Thomas Flohr, Herbert Bruder, Jürgen Simon, Stefan Schaller, Bernd Ohnesorge, and Bruno Dörrfuß, who is project lead for this system.
2006
Dimension Vista® 1500 system – first diagnostic analyzer integrating four technologies in one system
Our Dimension Vista® 1500 Intelligent Lab System launches as the industry's first ultra-integrated analyzer for high-volume clinical laboratories. Using four advanced detection technologies, the system provides laboratory personnel with the ability to efficiently perform a broad range of high-quality chemistry and immunochemistry tests on one analyzer.
2008
Artis zeego – robotic-assisted angiography system
We design Artis zeego to support surgical and interventional procedures. The flexible robotic stand allows for imaging in all surgical positions and brings faster workflows to the The unique robotic technology enables 3images for larger volumes to visualize large organs or long spines. Since 2008, minimally invasive treatments are on the rise and fixed C-arm systems like Artis zeego become more common in the Hybrid OR.
Typically, industry robots are separated by a fence to protect the operator. For the Artis zeego however, the robot had to work openly in a clinical environment. To master this challenging task, we closely work with Siemens’ robot-experienced Corporate Technology team.
2008
Ysio® – digital radiography, wireless flat panel detector
Our Ysio® can fully be customized; it’s a digital X-ray system for all clinical demands. highlight is the wireless detector, wi-Detectors convert X-rays to digital image information. At that time, they are usually firmly integrated in the examination table. Ysio’s wi-can be removed and placed directly underneath or next to the patient. Exposures that are difficult or impossible with an integrated detector can now be taken easily.
2009
syngo.via – multi-modality 3imaging network
With syngo.via, our imaging software for reading of clinical cases across different modalities, we place special focus on reading efficiency. When calling up a cardiac case, for example, the software automatically removes the blood pool and ribs, selects an appropriate cardiac phase, and displays the images in the correct layout. The physician can immediately start reading the case.
To develop syngo.via, we use our in-depth knowledge of disease-specific reading processes and AI-powered post processing algorithms. Our team built a technology that offers the broadest portfolio of clinical applications for routine and advanced reading and reporting.
2011
Biograph m– the world’s first integrated, simultaneous whole-body and PET
Our Biograph mis the first scanner to acquire and data at the same time. Doctors can now see the position of organs, their functioning, and metabolic processes in a single image. This enables more accurate diagnosis and can allow for the early detection of many diseases accompanied by changes in cell metabolism. The hybrid system is especially useful in cancer diagnosis and for examinations of the nervous system and heart.
Biograph mis developed as part of a community project by our units for molecular imaging in the and magnetic resonance in Germany. To bring this modality to market, we join forces with medical and research institutions around the world.

2012
As the world’s first wireless ultrasound system, our Freestyle™ facilitates the use in interventional radiology, anesthesiology, critical care, cath lab, or emergency care. It helps expand ultrasound into new applications, such as improving ultrasound-guided target localization in therapeutic interventions and biopsies.
To transmit the acquired ultrasound data directly to the screen, our team develops a new radio transmission protocol that’s able to simultaneously transmit data equivalent to ten of the – at that time – latest generation (4G) smart phones.
2014
Force – “Free breathing” scanning with dual X-ray sources & detectors
Force allows access to state-of-the-art computed tomography (CT) to the most sensitive patient groups such as small children or people with renal failure. Its scan speed of up to 74 centimeters per second is so high that it supports free breathing CT.
With Force, the third generation of our dual source scanners, the 600 people strong development team set new standards in computed tomography. Force is currently being used in a number of leading university hospitals across the globe.
2014
teamplay – cloud-based network
teamplay connects medical institutions and their imaging devices. The cloud-based solution with its apps monitors quantities such as imaging throughput or dose levels, utilization of staff, rooms and resources of the whole department down to every device and procedure, showing our customers where workflows need adjustments. And it links them to other users and their data to offer comparable benchmarks and exchange of images and reports.
teamplay started as a prototype at 2014 and has been constantly growing since. Today, clinical institutions in more than 45 countries transform their big data into smart data with teamplay.
2015
Mammomat Inspiration edition – wide-angle image acquisition breast tomosynthesis
Mammography screening means examining healthy women, so low dose and high image quality are key. Our Mammomat Inspiration edition delivers on that. And it comes with a special technology: Its tomosynthesis algorithm reconstructs multiple 2images of the breast into an approximation of a 3image. With that, doctors can better diagnose tumors that are hidden by overlapping breast tissue than with standard 2digital mammography.
Thomas Mertelmeier (left) and his team develop both the (Progressive Reconstruction, Intelligently Minimizing Exposure) technology and tomosynthesis for our systems over years of research and in close collaboration with clinical partners.
2015
Multitom Rax – first Twin Robotic X-ray scanner for enhanced patient care and productivity
Our Multitom Rax enables the widest range of X-ray examinations with a single scanner in one room: 2radiography, fluoroscopy, angiography, interventions, and 3bone imaging. This is enabled by the two ceiling-mounted robotic arms, which ensure high-quality imaging. They automatically move around the patient, making examinations safer and more convenient; patient repositioning and transfers to other imaging rooms become obsolete.
2016
Liquid biopsy
liquid biopsy is the sampling and analysis of non-solid biological tissue, primarily blood. It is mainly used as a diagnostic and monitoring tool for diseases such as cancer, with the added benefit of being largely non-invasive. With NEOliquid1 we offer a minimally-invasive cancer diagnostics blood test that can help doctors provide a precise diagnosis to guide individualized therapy.

Digital IDIndustrial Automation: Answers for Manufacturing Productivity
The most forward-thinking companies turn to every day for answers that enable smart, fast and lean manufacturing. Driven by a nearly universal client requirement to drive process efficiency, our industrial automation solutions are rigorously engineered to:
Assess client technology and efficiency needs
Build a tailored plan that drives quick time to value
Deploy sensors to monitor manufacturing process performance
Automate processes using software, data and logic controllers
Schlafly Hops Over Growth Limits
With growing demand for craft brewed beer and limited expansion potential, Schlafly needed to increase output within their brewery, while maintaining the quality of their craft beer brews.
Schlafly automated brewing tasks, introduced process controls and systematically applied data intelligence using industrial automation technology from Siemens.
The brewery was able to increase process efficiency by 30%, while improving product consistency.
The process control system is based on a 7 platform. It took over routine functions like turning on pumps and the opening and closing of valves. Those functions now happen consistently and on time – taking minutes off the average brew cycle.
The kind of transformation going on at Schlafly Bottleworks is just one example of how industrial automation solutions are helping our customers stay ahead of the competition.
Dependable Technology from a Trusted Partner
industrial automation technology and deep domain expertise drives process efficiency, enables quality control and lowers operating costs. Working with clients to understand their manufacturing challenges, solutions include:
Advanced process control technology such as 7 , which provide a solid foundation to optimize manufacturing with sensors, software and logic control mechanisms.
Industry-specific process engineering expertise across diverse industries such as chemicals, food & beverage, glass, solar, water treatment technologies and pharmaceuticals.
Consulting and lifecycle management services through a global delivery network of in-house experts, solution providers and suppliers.
Legacy system integration or migration projects with a focus on reducing total cost of ownership and delivering quick time to value.

We make real what matters
By reimagining the world around us, creating solutions to the most challenging problems and making infrastructure more intuitive, we’re making the world a smarter place.
You are here:
Overview
What we do
We create technologies that take society further. How? Through electrification, digitalization and automation. We’re changing the cities you live in, the places you work, the energy that powers your home, and the way the products you love are manufactured.
We’re making a difference to the world we live in every day. We’ve reduced congestion in cities by 20% by using intelligent real-time traffic data; we’ve built offices using nothing but a 3printer; we’ve created software that communicates with turbines in the middle of the ocean; and we helped develop the Curiosity rover and land it safely on Mars.
By working with like-minded companies around the globe, we can create innovations that contribute to society’s success. It’s what inspires 351,000 people at to come and work together each day. 
”
For me, ‘Ingenuity for life’ stands for ingenious people who relentlessly strive for engineering innovation that benefits society.
Joe Kaeser, 
President and Chief Executive Officer

Veterans at Big ideas start with people
When you’re surrounded by teammates who love what they do, you can achieve anything.
You are here:
Overview
Life at People at are thinkers, dreamers and doers. That’s why we recruit people with more than just a passion for disruptive ideas – they must also have the courage to bring them to life. 
We believe those ideas can come from anywhere. It’s how we design and implement over 7,600 different inventions around the world each year. Some emerged from our 36-hour hackathons, others were simply thought of while sitting outside in our cafe. There’s no working behind closed doors here. We invite everyone to work collaboratively and act as if were their own company – it’s all part of our Ownership Culture.
”
Trying out new things, not always waiting for instruction, having your own thoughts about what you’d do differently. That shapes the future and drives it forward.
Janina Kugel, 
Chief Human Resources Officer
We believe diversity creates more opportunity for success. That’s why we recruit great minds from all walks of life: it doesn’t matter the gender, age, ethnic background, sexual orientation or disability. Our main aim is to find people from around the globe who can contribute to world-changing technology.
Honored to find ourselves in good company on 
HRC’s
 2018 “Best Places to Work” list, for the second consecutive year.

Overview
About us
Digitalization, globalization, urbanization, demographic change and climate change are transforming our world. We’re using engineering and technology to meet some of the toughest challenges in the US, while making sure we’re fully prepared for what lies ahead.
With over 50,000 people spread across all 50 states and Puerto Rico, we’re working together to keep America moving every day. We’ve transformed the Mercedes-Benz Superdome in New Orleans with energy-efficient lighting and temperature management systems, refurbished transit vehicles in Sacramento to expand their lifespan by up to 15 years, and delivered world-class power generation equipment for Panda Power Funds projects to help produce cleaner, cheaper, natural gas.
If you’re excited by keeping one of the largest countries in the world moving forwards and helping it operate smarter than ever before, let’s chat.

Modern, interconnected and IT-based mobility is the core competency of Mobility's five business units.
The demand for mobility is growing all over the world. Transporting people and goods to all corners of the earth presents challenges for the infrastructure of national economies. This applies, in particular, to the transport and logistics facilities of cities: Will cities be able to solve the problems caused by increasing road traffic? Can public transportation help them avoid total gridlock? How can railway operators increase the efficiency and safety of their systems? How can rail and road traffic be integrated? How can logistics supply chains be further optimised as freight volumes continue to increase steadily?

The Mobility Division provides answers to all of these questions with its comprehensive portfolio; because modern, interconnected and IT-based mobility is the core competency of its five business units: Mobility Management, Turnkey Projects & Electrification, Mainline Transport, Urban Transport and Customer Services. They have the know-how to make road traffic flow more smoothly and quickly, make trains more environmentally friendly and efficient, make train schedules and freight shipments more reliable. We work with our customers to develop optimal solutions to help overcome their challenges.
The portfolio of the Mobility Division includes
the full range of vehicles for rail traffic: Regional, as well as intercity and high speed trains, metro cars, streetcars and light rail, passenger coaches, driverless vehicles and locomotives
Signal and control technology for rail-based passenger and freight traffic

With innovative concepts like the Green Building Initiative and the energy efficiency program, optimizes resource allocation while at the same time making buildings more energy efficient. This enables the company to design and operate its own buildings economically over their entire lifecycles. New buildings and important existing structures alike have to meet systematic sustainability criteria and are certified according to the international Green Building Standard (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design).
Through the energy-focused renovation of the building services technology and structural measures at more than 15 production locations, annual energy consumption was reduced for example by over 4.4 million euros. Most measures were implemented under an energy performance contracting with Siemens’ Building Technologies Division and resulted in a sustainable reduction in annual CO
2
 emissions by more than 16,000 tons.
Intelligent location concepts and a forward-looking real estate strategy are helping tap markets worldwide – with thereby laying the groundwork for the company's business operations and creating the infrastructure needs to drive global growth.
Through the introduction of a trendsetting work concept is helping to be attractive to today's best employees as well as tomorrow's best talents. This is achieved by an open and modern office landscape which allows for efficient use of office space and fosters interaction among employees.
Real Estate is a trusted partner to Siemens’ operating units, helping them capture and maintain optimal competitive positions.

Heading toward a Sustainable Energy future
Meeting the challenges of a sustainable energy system. The world’s population is growing – the demand for energy is growing faster. This presents four core challenges for a sustainable energy system: security of supply, affordability, climate protection, and resource efficiency. It will take ingenuity to succeed.
Get digital with our Customer Value Co-Creation method
Want to know how we helped our customer B.Grimm to create more transparency on their fleet operations? We sat down with them, identified the challenge and directly created a working software together. Read more about this from our digital expert John Ayotte!
Improvements needed all along the energy conversion chain
In order to meet the sustainability challenges, measures must be taken along the entire energy conversion chain – from the utilization of fossil resources for power generation and transportation to improvements in consumption.
Mastering the operation of a Sustainable Energy system
Working on the improvement of energy efficiency always has been a core driver for the industry. And it has made tremendous progress in providing innovative technologies that contribute to the better utilization of fossil and renewable resources as well as generated power. Still, this is not enough to meet future demanding targets. The energy system of tomorrow will need to produce much lower greenhouse gas emissions than the one we have today. In order to do so, it will have to master a much higher share of renewable energy sources, fluctuating feed-in volumes, and increasingly decentralized production at ever smaller power plants. This will require many different market operators and technologies to join forces, forming a complex power supply system with new business models. So, besides improvements to each part and piece of the hardware along the energy conversion chain, in the future digitalization will be key to running a stable and sustainable energy system and its parts. Take a minute to listen to the opinions of high-level experts:
change hard to cope with
Amory Lovins – Chief Scientist, Rocky Mountains Institute
Anyone aspiring to comprehend current trends in global energy markets must reckon with the words and ideas of Amory Lovins. Over four decades, Lovins has established a reputation as perhaps the world’s foremost authority on energy efficiency and clean energy solutions.
“The oil companies, just like the electric utility incumbents, have to figure out different ways to use their assets, capabilities and, most difficultly, cultures to compete in a very different market,” Amory Lovins said in a recent interview at his showcase green home near Snowmass, Colorado. “This change in the market is coming at them at a speed they can scarcely imagine and much faster than their cultures will find it easy to cope with.”
Richard Lancaster – of Holdings Limited, Hong Kong
talk with Richard Lancaster, of one of Asia’s largest power utilities, about climate change and whether energy technology is ready to meet this challenge.
“Ideally, we would have no carbon emissions. But that involves a huge change. Meanwhile, we have the technologies to navigate through the transition. If you look at that transition, you can’t go for a perfect solution all at once. It would take too long.
This is why we will need more gas, more nuclear, more renewables – and a more efficient use of energy. We need to do all of these things”, Lancaster says.

The market becomes manifold
The energy system has never been easy to handle. But with the new possibilities arising with digitalization, it has (and will continue to) become even more demanding to manage a sustainable energy system. At the same time, there will be many more opportunities for more players to participate profitably in the market.
Prof. Jacob Østergaard, Head of the Center for Electric Power and Energy at the Technical University of Denmark DTU, talks about the major trends and the impact of developments for market players.

Overview
Life at Adapting to civilian life after years of service isn’t easy. There were an estimated 453,000 unemployed veterans in 2016 in the alone. But since 2011, thousands of servicemen and women have made the leap and joined to continue their passion for engineering and manufacturing.
Back in 2005, a military convoy was making its way across the hot Iraqi desert. Their operation was to escort a 700 ton generator, nicknamed the ‘MOAG’ (Mother Of All Generators), safely across one of the most hazardous areas in the Middle East.
In such dangerous and unpredictable territory, the risk of attack was high – and the need for security was vital. Across six grueling days, in temperatures as high as 120 degrees, the team managed to safely complete one of the most logistically complex operations of the Iraqi reconstruction effort.
The operation, which was a joint effort between and the military, meant Iraq’s electrical grid was increased by 260 additional megawatts. That’s enough to bring a year’s worth of power to hospitals, schools, supermarkets and homes.
Bo Brockett, an ex-Army Specialist, unit armorer and combat engineer from Iowa, was one of the team on the ground in the desert. He knows what it means to come home from service, to a life where nobody quite understands what you’ve seen. Nine years after completing that operation, he’s swapped escorting 700 ton generators for managing wind turbine blades the size of half a football field. He now works at the Wind Power Blade Manufacturing Facility in Fort Madison, Iowa as an overhead crane operator.
He’s one of 2,500 veterans who have made the jump from the military to Siemens. Among those veterans are former Aviation Mechanics, Navy Engineers and Nuclear Surface Warfare Officers all putting their skills to use in new ways. They bring with them a host of transferable skills, ideas and approaches which translate into a range of roles, from leadership to project management, field service and manufacturing. For former colonels, their experience of leading teams through tough missions makes them natural leaders at work. Transferring these skills into new work helps veterans find purpose again, but adapting to civilian life is still tough; in the 50,000 veterans are homeless and sleeping on the streets every night, and unable to reintegrate back into society even after serving in conflict zones.
“We veterans are a special group of people,” Brockett said. “It can be a long, tough transition from soldier to civilian, depending on our experiences, our character and our expectations.” Applying what he learned in the military to his work, he says, has helped him to integrate back into life in Iowa. The mantra he’s lived by? “Be patient, and drive on.”
Over the next five years at least 2,500 more military veterans are expected to join as part of a partnership with the White House which was formed in 2011. They’ll be joining a vibrant veteran community at Siemens, where mentoring and job training helps veterans to reintegrate back into work smoothly across industries including automotive, aerospace, energy, high-tech electronics and machinery. 
was also named a Top Veteran-Friendly Company by Veterans Magazine, but it’s the camaraderie within the community that speaks for itself, continuing the team bond that’s present in the forces. One member of our team even created the 
Wall of Heroes
, a Facebook page that shares the stories of some of the former service people working with us. Photographs show them now and then, standing proud in uniform on overseas deployment sit alongside portraits of them today with their teams in any number of states across the country. It’s a reminder of some of the amazing stories our colleagues have to tell, and of all the veterans working across the organization today who’ve made the journey from soldier to civilian.

Dave Hopping joined in 1989, and is the President of Siemens’ Building Technologies (BT) Division – Americas. He leads operational and commercial activities for Siemens’ broad portfolio of products and services across building automation, energy management, fire safety and security solutions for buildings, facilities and enterprises across all industries for the Americas.

Immediately prior to this role, Hopping was the Vice President of BT’s Building Performance and Sustainability business line which includes the core energy and sustainability businesses of performance contracting, energy services, sustainability and energy management, and green building solutions. Before that, he headed the Building Automation business unit that included the solutions, service, and energy business.

All but four of his more than 30 years of industry experience have been with Siemens. During this time, Hopping has steadily held successive leadership positions in Sales, Operations, and Management across the country.

In addition to his business leadership responsibilities, Hopping is presently a board member of the Foundation, Chicago’s Museum of Science and Industry and LABS’ City Digital project, and formerly served on the board for the Alliance to Save Energy. In the past, he has served as the Chicago City Ambassador for Corporation, USA, and he is currently Siemens’ Executive Sponsor for the City of Chicago.

Located in BT’s North American corporate headquarters in Buffalo Grove, Illinois, USA, Hopping earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from Purdue University.

Overview
What we do
Dr. Frank Anton believes the history of flight is defined by three pivotal moments. At the dawn of the 20th century, in 1903, the first engine-powered aircraft touched down after soaring for a total of twelve seconds. This was aviation’s first disruptive revolution: the airplane was born and an epoch of aeronautical innovation had begun.
Jumping ahead to the middle of the 20th century, as a new class of tourists sipped cocktails high over the Atlantic, a recent invention – the turbofan – propelled them and the glamorous Golden Age of Flying into the future. This air-breathing jet engine, although highly evolved, still powers air travel today and its commercial introduction in the 1950s and 60s can be considered the second disruptive aeronautical revolution.

Now in 2017, almost sixty years on from the adoption of the jet engine, Dr. Frank Anton and his world-class team are working away on the third disruptive revolution in the history of flight. And this time it’s electric and the stakes are even higher.
”
My goal is to hand over electric propulsion to the next generation in order to make aviation continue on this planet.
Dr. Frank Anton, 
Head eAircraft
 “My goal is to hand over electric propulsion to the next generation in order to make aviation continue on this planet. Because if we don’t it will disappear,” says Dr. Anton from his office on the campus in Erlangen, Germany.

The risk to aviation? “Regional traffic will vanish from our skies if we cannot lower carbon dioxide levels. And we absolutely cannot lower carbon dioxide, whilst keeping planes in the sky, without electric propulsion.”

That’s a grave prospect for a life-long lover of everything with wings. But Dr. Anton is optimistic about the future of flight as he and his team have already designed, built and flown a fully working hybrid-electrical propulsion system.

When Dr. Anton and his counterpart at Airbus started the project, the whole world still believed that electric flight made no sense. “All the specialists said it was impossible. We both thought it was impossible.” But as the newly established team of aviation experts and electrical engineers came together to work on the problem, they started to believe, little by little, that maybe it was more than just a dream.

The first challenge the team had to overcome was the power-to-weight ratio. normal electric motor provides around 1 kilowatt of power for every kilogram of weight. To get a small plane to take off and fly the team needed to extract at least 6 kilowatts of power from every kilogram of engine weight. The specialists were skeptical.

But Dr. Anton’s team proved them wrong. And quickly. On the very first run they managed to produce a result that was only just short of that target – an early achievement that they went on to build upon, demonstrating commercially viable electric propulsion was possible.
Their secret weapon: Product Lifecycle Management solutions. Or software suite developed by that allowed the team to design, model and test every single detail of the proposed motor before manufacturing a single physical part. “With such a complex problem where everything has to work together, simulating the whole propulsion system was the only method we could use to rethink our approach to creating a system in a completely different way.”

One such breakthrough provided was the ability to eliminate all unnecessary parts in the design by replicating the evolutionary processes of the human body. “We removed all of the structural elements that are not needed in order to concentrate the strong forces it can take with the minimum amount of material. Just like the way the human body builds bones by only growing material where the force lines are to give you a lighter but stronger structure.”

Finding new ways to work have been key to his team’s success. His belief is that not only do you need to create a workplace where people of all levels of experience can thrive and contribute, but you also need to start innovation with the customer. “New technology has no value unless there is a customer value. How do you find out that value? Only with the right customer, because only then can you understand the application and start to understand what can be done with the new technology, if at all.”

Dr. Anton had found the right customers and partners in EXTRA, Diamond Aircraft, and Airbus. He had built the team who had designed the models. And together they had constructed an electrical propulsion system that was both lightweight and powerful. It was time to fly.

”
We are not breaking the laws of physics. We’re simply combining existing solutions in a new way.
Dr. Frank Anton, 
Head eAircraft
And fly it did. In 2015 –  in almost silence – an aerobatic aircraft lifted off from an airfield in north-central Germany powered by, for the very first time in the history of aviation, an electric drive system in this power class.

And since that record-breaking flight the Electric Aircraft Team have achieved another milestone: powering a larger two-seater plane with the same system.

Dr. Anton, an experienced pilot himself, was one of the first people to fly the plane. “It is fantastic. It is really like driving an electric car, everything is so much smoother. ” Quieter too. “You take off your headphones and realise you don’t need them. You can talk to your co-pilot without the need for an intercom – that takes some getting used to.”

greener, quieter form of travel. Dr. Anton believes this is what all 100-seater, regional aircrafts could look and sound like by 2035, helping society to reduce carbon dioxide levels and securing the future of flight for the next generation. The third disruptive innovation is airborne; the age of electrical flight has begun. And Dr. Anton, his team at and his collaborative business partners aren’t stopping here.

The Digital Factory Division aims to provide its customers with a comprehensive portfolio of hardware and software products which enable the comprehensive integration of data from development, production and suppliers.
The seamless integration of data along the industrial value chains will gain more and more in importance, becoming a key criterion for the survival of developing / manufacturing companies. The Digital Factory Division aims to provide its customers with a comprehensive portfolio of hardware and software products which enable the comprehensive integration of data from development, production and suppliers. The complete digital representation of the entire physical value chain is our ultimate goal. We call the solution platform which we created for this purpose "Digital Enterprise".

Under this term the product portfolio already smoothly connects major parts of the product and production life cycle today. Powerful Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) software, for example, allows us to develop and optimize new products on an entirely virtual basis. In the real manufacturing world the Totally Integrated Automation (TIA) concept, which has proven its worth for about 20 years now, ensures the efficient interoperability of all automation components. The Portal, for example, already enables significant time and cost savings in engineering.

In close cooperation with its partners within Siemens, and especially the Process Industries and Drives (PD) Division, the Digital Factory Division provides a large and unique portfolio of software tools and industrial automation and drive technology tailored to meet individual customer requirements in various discrete industrial areas.

In addition, customers can rely on the Division's commitment to the long-term development of their businesses. Protecting our customers' investments now and in the future – a particularly important consideration in the software business – is one of the major pillars of our business strategy. And when it comes to shaping the future of industry, is a driving and trendsetting force which joins with its partners worldwide in proven leading-edge technologies to increase productivity and protect a competitive edge.

Overview
What we do
It’s not every day you can say that your work is responsible for almost every manufactured good; or that your career is vital to the success of most machines on Earth. But for one team at working all around the world, it’s just another day at the ‘office’. 
The cranes lifting thousands of our newly-built laptops from factory trucks, to place them on container ships; the machines making up the assembly line turning wood into thousands of sheets of crisp, white paper – they all have the common ability to move. To spin, to cut, to push, to lift, to stretch, to catch: whatever the movement, the humble industrial drive hidden within the machine makes it all possible.
And there’s a big team of people who make sure those industrial drives don’t stop. Making sure they are cutting and spinning and lifting and pushing. Making sure our paper gets milled, our energy gets generated, our laptops are delivered. Making sure our world keeps moving.
Jürgen Gernhart is the Head of Service Engineers for Industry Drives at in Germany. His team looks after industrial drives across several industries, working on projects ranging from days to months to years.
”
At the start of a crane project, we’ll travel to Shanghai. At the end, we might finish off in Saudi Arabia. We service machines that use industrial drives all over the world.
Björn Kredel, 
Commissioning Engineer & Developer
“Every technology has its own challenges, from cranes to paper machines. You’ll have smaller motors for things like newspapers, and larger drives for mining or powering the cooling pumps of big power plants. We can engineer and service drives as big as this room. They are in every industry because without them, nothing will happen.”
With projects taking the team members to places such as Korea, Algeria, Brazil, Nigeria and Chile, they really are powering the global economy with their expertise. Björn Kredel, a Commissioning Engineer and Developer, travels for about 50% of his work: “At the start of a crane project, we’ll travel to Shanghai. At the end, we might finish off in Saudi Arabia. We service machines that use industrial drives all over the world.”

With machines from all across the globe being powered by industrial drives – from the huge levers that open Tower Bridge for passing boats, to the robots that meticulously fill your coffee machine pods – the team works closely with their thousands of customers. Iuliu Vlaic, Commissioning Engineer for Electrical Drives and Automation, works on call for a few weeks a year to ensure the smooth running of paper factories. “Think about a paper mill, for example: if the production stalls, the loss can be up to €5,000 per hour. So for 10 hours of standstill, that’s €50,000 gone.”
Global commerce relies heavily on the team’s aptitude for thinking creatively while under pressure. Jacqueline Pramana works in Business Development and knows all too well the importance of her speedy problem-solving abilities. “You are the representative from Siemens, you are there to make it work.”
But in a time of fast moving technological advancements and big changes in our planet’s make-up, the team doesn’t simply continue to engineer, commission and service our industrial machines. They have to develop new innovations for new technologies. Jacqueline explains: 
“In the last few years, electrical drives have been used more and more to buffer energy, so you can capture and regenerate the movement created by the drives into energy. Years ago, they used to let the machines burn energy which was just wasted.” For example, if you could capture the energy from the heat produced by your car brakes, that energy could be transferred back into powering the car itself.
Thomas Lehmeyer, a Commissioning Engineer, adds: “Nowadays you can install sensors everywhere so you can analyse the system and perform predictive maintenance. You can take a look and say ‘in one month, this motor will fail’, allowing time to be saved by preparing ahead. small increase in efficiency has a huge impact on costs.”
This team of people are keen on moving with the times and the freedom to choose between projects has kept their work fresh and tailored to their preferences. “You can develop into the direction you want,” Jacqueline says. “I’ve decided all of the steps I’ve taken in the last six years. That’s the good thing about a large company, you can change your activities without having to change organization.”
Jürgen knows that to attract the best talent, the full breadth of must also be available to new recruits: “We have access to several technologies and departments right across the industry. For people coming out of university, it’s a great opportunity to get broad experience and try out various different technologies.”

We are in this phase of automation. We want things to be done faster and better, so this field is enhancing the living standards of people.
Iuliu Vlaic, 
Commissioning Engineer, Electrical Drives & Automation
Despite the team’s sizeable impact on the movement of the world, most of their work is done behind the scenes. At best, people take industrial drives for granted, but most won’t even know they exist.
Björn Kredel, a Commissioning Engineer & Developer on the team, speaks about the hidden nature of the technology: “No one really recognizes the role that industrial drives play in the world. Nobody knows there are thousands of industrial drives involved in producing smartphones. With more drives, everything will become automated and it will get less expensive to make products like smartphones – but people will only see the price reduction, not the reason behind it.”
Lots of people are worried that their jobs are at risk due to mechanical replacements. As a result, the work of the team is becoming a hot topic for discussion, and could be seen as both a blessing and a curse. As Iuliu laments: “We are in this phase of automation. We want things to be done faster and better, so this field is enhancing the living standards of people. Everyone is thinking that automation is killing jobs, but it’s not true. You create other jobs by making things smarter.”
What can be said for sure is that the team plays a huge role in crafting our future. Whether that’s powering the cranes that carry our goods, or building the robots allowing us to eradicate dull work, these international problem-solvers aren’t just keeping our world moving – they are powering the creation of what comes next.

Working with robots: the future of collaboration
“Robots and humans will work in total harmony.”

Overview
What we do
Millions of years ago, in prehistoric Africa an early human picked up a stone and used it as a hammer. And so the first tool was born. Today, in China, Zi Jian  and his team have taken the next evolutionary step: through simple hand gestures they’ve taught robots to use tools for us.
Imagine a world where robots and humans work side-by-side. Where you can command a robot to lift a box or pass a tool with absolute precision, using a simple hand gesture. Where the learning ability of humans and the accuracy and strength of robots work in harmony to make our lives easier, safer and richer.
That’s the vision of Zi Jian  and his colleagues, a pioneering team researching and testing technologies for the future of manufacturing, as part of the ‘Autonomous Systems Revolution’ Project.
Hard at work at a lab in bustling Beijing, this world-class team are building a tool that lets humans and robots communicate. It has no keyboard and there isn’t a touchscreen in sight. But with leading-edge thinking and smart technology they’ve opened up a channel of communication between man and machine. 
Like most children, Zi Jian loved robots, but what started out as a childhood hobby stayed with him throughout college and his PhD, when he took robotics classes in his free time. It wasn’t until he joined that he had the chance to work with a real robot. Zi Jian’s childhood passion became his profession.
For just over a year, Zi Jian  has been working on the data glove, a tool that allows a person to control and command a robotic arm. Using different sensors, the glove captures and translates the movements and gestures of human hands – and, someday soon, their exact pressure levels – into actions that are performed by the hand of a robot. Through this clever mechanism a human can command a robot to pick up heavy objects, hand over tools and components, or assist in assembling parts of a product.
There is fierce debate as to whether robots will replace human jobs, effectively making us redundant. But Zi Jian  sees a future where humans and robots work in harmony. Where robots can be trained by their human co-workers to perform tasks that are dull, dangerous, or for which they are stronger or better equipped to carry out. 
”
I’ve been interested in robots since childhood. Finally, got the chance to deal with a real robot at Siemens. That’s why joined.
Dr. Wang Zi Jian, 
Expert Research Scientist
Pressure sensors on the tip of the robot’s hand send feedback to the person wearing the glove, so touching an object through a robot’s hand will feel the same as if you were touching it yourself. And so the intelligence and decision-making powers of humans are matched by the strength and precision of robots, allowing for ever more complex, delicate and exciting possibilities. 
Using gesture-based interactions, a car manufacturing worker will be able to direct a machine to assemble a car, sensing and feeling each part as if it were in their hands. Cumbersome, strenuous work will be carried out with grace, ease and efficiency by our robot co-workers.
 “Once this channel of communication has been opened, it can be used to control anything you want.” From robots that are trained to assist neurosurgeons during complicated brain surgery, to factory robots that take on the lifting and mixing of chemicals in a factory – vital tasks that can be hazardous to humans. The opportunities for human-robot collaboration are endless.
”
The main purpose of the data glove is to function as an interaction, so when the robot is working by the side of the human, the human can communicate with the robot.
“Eventually robots will be able to understand human intention,” says Zi Jian. If someone falls in the workplace a robot will be able to recognize they need help and come to their aide. Or if someone drops a tool the robot will be able to pick it up and hand it back, without being asked to.”
In the distant future, 50 years away or more, Zi Jian imagines an even more intuitive human-robot interaction. Robots will receive commands directly from human minds, creating a truly unique collaborative partnership. “You want the robot to fetch you a tool? You just think about it.”
“There are currently many industrial robots in factories, most of them working alone, locked in some kind of cage.” But with passion and innovation Zi Jian has opened the door, bringing humans and robots that much closer. One small gesture for robots, one giant leap for mankind.

Future of Manufacturing
Companies that want to be successful in the future are seizing the opportunities provided by digitalization right now. Digitalization promises lower costs, improved production quality, flexibility and efficiency, shorter response time to customer requests and market demands, and it also opens up new and innovative business areas. Regardless of sector or company size, for these reasons it’s essential for all decision-makers to invest in the future today. The good news is that there are already solutions for the digital enterprise.

The promises of digitalization
Digitalization is everywhere. Mobile phones are crammed full of networked applications, automobiles are turning into computers you can drive, refrigerators notify your mobile phone when their inventory is low, and we couldn’t imagine being without online shopping. But digitalization affects more than just end customers – it affects industry, too.
The digitalization of the manufacturing industry is a topic of global interest – in Germany the concept is known as “Industrie 4.0.” New products must be brought to market in ever-shorter timeframes. Customers demand products that satisfy their specific needs. Rapidly changing markets call for a growing level of flexibility. And the constant desire for increased efficiency means shorter and shorter development time and the efficient use of resources and energy. All with no loss of quality – or even improved quality, in some cases.

Publications on the Future of Manufacturing
                Digital enterprise
To draw on all the benefits of digitalization, businesses must first achieve an end-to-end integration of their data. This requires the integration of industrial software and automation, the expansion of communications networks, security in the area of automation and the use of business-specific industrial services. Companies that have completely digitally integrated their business processes and those of their suppliers can generate a digital representation of their entire value chain.

The process industry needs plants to remain stable and operate without interruption for decades, while also maintaining maximum energy efficiency. Product quality must not fluctuate at all throughout the entire plant’s service life. These companies can benefit from simulating, testing, and optimizing processes and plants before operation in the real world. Gathering and evaluating data on the fly makes it possible to constantly monitor and refine processes. Feedback from the production process and the end customers can be incorporated for further improvement. End-to-end data integration also permits predictive maintenance, which helps avoid unnecessary maintenance work and plant downtime.

In the manufacturing industry, companies have to respond flexibly and efficiently to the individual requests of their customers. The essential factor is getting the desired products to the market as quickly and simply as possible and at the lowest possible price. Digitalization must be considered holistically, because focusing on automation alone is no longer sufficient. The comprehensive, shared database needs to extend from product design to production planning, engineering, production, and services, and also incorporates the suppliers and customers. The experience acquired along the entire value chain then flows back into the design and development processes. This cycle enables both manufacturing companies and mechanical engineers to benefit from all the advantages offered by digitalization.

The vast majority of business, hospital, and higher education leaders have strong concerns about rising energy costs, business interruptions from weather-related events, and the daunting specter of cyberattacks on power grids. But, according to a Harvard Business Review Analytic Services study, only a small minority of organizations have embarked on any significant course of action to address these concerns; only about a third of organizations have developed business resiliency plans. Even fewer have put an energy procurement strategy in place.

We all know that our world is becoming ever more connected. Billions of intelligent devices and machines are generating massive amounts of data that creates enormous potential for businesses and other organizations to optimize their operations and obtain important efficiencies. Digitalization creates not only these important opportunities, but also significant challenges. In particular, greater connectivity presents the potential for risk if not recognized and managed.  
It is with growing concern that hackers are increasingly targeting 
operational technology (OT
), essential for availability, production and safety of 
critical infrastructure
. Attacks against have ballooned 
from 5% to 30%
 in the last few years. Energy companies make up a majority of these attacks – a spike driven by aging assets, outdated security practices and increased connectivity.
The attached provides a high-level overview of both the benefits and challenges from digitalization in the energy sector. This study covers topics such as:
The new risk frontier in the energy sector and what the industry must do to prepare.
The relationship between connectivity, transparency and insight.
Why security analytics are an essential part of any organization.

survey last year of managers in the oil and gas industry reveals that the deployment of cybersecurity measures isn’t keeping pace with the growth of digitalization in their sector’s operations. The Ponemon Institute, in its The State of Cybersecurity in the Oil & Gas Industry: United States, found that just 35 percent of respondents rated their organization’s operational technology (OT) cyber readiness as high. 
Additional key findings in this first-of-a-kind study related to cyber readiness, risks and challenges include:
59 percent believe there is a greater risk in the environment than the environment;
61 percent said their organization has difficulty mitigating cyber risks across the oil and gas value chain;
Only 41 percent of respondents said they continually monitor infrastructure to prioritize threats and attacks;
65 percent of respondents say the top cybersecurity threat is the negligent or careless insider and 15 percent of respondents say it is the malicious or criminal insider – underscoring the need for advanced monitoring solutions and critical safety zones to identify atypical behavior among personnel;
61 percent say their organizations’ industrial control systems protection and security is inadequate.

With growing urbanization, often critical financial conditions and the challenges of climate change cities carry a crucial part of development as a whole. What does intelligent infrastructure mean then for buildings, mobility solutions and energy management?  
Creating a functioning infrastructure is much more than spending enormous amounts of money. What are the most efficient infrastructure investments to create the best possible output?
How can we build cities that remain liveable even under the circumstances of ever more frequent weather-related catastrophes in combination with population growth and urbanization in general?

Infrastrucutre has a profound effect on quality of life, but one that we only really appreciate when things do not work as well as they should. Anybody who has experienced power blackouts or stuck in traffic jams knows that things could, and should, be better.
Urbanization complicates matters further. Each week, cities are growing by 1.5mn inhabitants, and by 2050 more than two-thirds of the global population will be city dwellers, up from just one-third in 1950. As cities grow, the way we build and manage urban infrastructure has never been more critical to global economic and social development.
Digitalization is changing our world. Today the number of connected devices has surpassed the number of humans on the planet. These intelligent devices generate massive amounts of data transforming life and business across all sectors. However, much infrastructure has yet to be transformed by the information age. Instead, in most places, trains, power systems, buildings, buses, and roads have hardly changed in nature. Some digital systems have been incorporated but we have only just begun to unlock the potential of fully digitized, electrified, information-enabled, intelligent infrastructure. Doing so will be key to meeting the world’s present and future sustainable development challenges. is a trusted partner offering solutions across all infrastructure domains making cities more efficient, sustainable and resilient. We help you meet the challenges that cities of the future face: maintaining, modernizing and upgrading an ageing urban infrastructure.
”
With more than half of the global population living in cities, there is no doubt that we live in an urbanized world and the global challenges of the 21st century are in urban areas.

Executive Director of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme  (source: Interview with Joan Clos by the Non-Governmental Liaison Service on the "Rio+20" conference, June 2012)

Energy management in modern buildings
Applying and managing energy efficiently
In the future, intelligent buildings will be so-called ‘prosumers’, i.e. they will produce and consume energy. They interact with the smart grid and control power demand and generation in order to save energy costs and reduce CO2 emissions. The Building Energy Management System (BEMS) is at the core of this; it creates the perfect balance between consumption and production. That this concept is not only limited to single buildings but to entire city areas is shown by the following example

41% of worldwide energy consumption, responsible for one third of greenhouse gas emissions: Buildings are one major part of the worldwide environmental footprint. If we’d like to succeed against climate change, sustainable, and energy-efficient buildings need to be part of a global answer.
Beside buildings’ environmental impact, there are also economical aspects: Real Estate often is the 2nd largest expense on most organizations’ income statement. So buildings can be a critical factor for a company’s success and in the end for the employees’ job security.

But buildings are far more than that. People spend about 90 % of their lives indoors – starting with our birth in hospitals, learning at schools, developing at universities, succeeding in jobs in office buildings. Buildings are not just a place for working and living. It’s the place where we spend our lives.

Overview
Life at Along well-trodden global migration routes, across deserts and over oceans, millions of refugees every year travel thousands of miles to escape conflict in their homeland. Carrying little, they leave behind their jobs, property and even sometimes their family. Fear drives them forward and hope gives them strength; they dream of a better future in another place.
”
It makes me really proud to work here because the employees and managers are really motivated to give their best to this.
After months of negotiating national borders, arriving in countries like Germany isn’t the end of their journey – it’s just the beginning of an often long process of asylum and integration.
Jörg heads up the Internship of Refugees Program and knows how a little stability can make a huge difference. “The paid internships are generally two months long, for people with qualifications who are going through the asylum process,” Jörg explains.
“Many refugees have had a great education. So to give them rewarding work and show them how a big organization like is set up, and what it’s like working in Germany – this is the first step of integration.”

There has been plenty of interest from refugees to enroll on the scheme and some have already been made into permanent members of the team. One of those, originally from Eritrea, went to Egypt and was kidnapped.
“Three months later, his family paid the demanded sum for his release. Then he travelled to Munich where he found a host family.”
It was from there he was offered an internship with to help develop his talent.
Now, he has started an apprenticeship and is one of the 351,000 people that make up the company around the world.
”
It opens up our culture, removes prejudice and opens your mind to the situation.
Jörg Pohl, 
Project Lead
Integrating into a brand new culture is not an easy thing to do, especially for those who have fled their home. internships offer the chance to gain valuable experience by improving language skills, developing talents and building some lasting friendships.
Everyone on the internship is assigned a mentor from the very beginning as part of a ‘buddy system’. It gives them someone to talk to and offers them guidance throughout the program. “Sometimes they’ll go for a coffee, have lunch, or go to the cinema. It’s much more personal.”
The internship program isn’t the only thing is doing. Jörg explains how unused office space is being turned into accommodation for families to live in, and pre-classes have been created for younger refugees to prepare them for the apprenticeship program at Siemens. Sports parks are also being opened up for soccer and ping pong matches with employees. It's this type of contact that starts to change everyone's perception and encourages integration.
The majority of refugees on the program fled from Syria and Eritrea – and Jörg has found that many are highly skilled in engineering and IT.

Many managers have been so pleased with the interns who have taken part in the program that they want to recruit more. Lots of them say: “It opens up our culture, removes prejudice and opens your mind to the situation.”

Jörg admits that the integration process is a long and complex process, and that it all starts with face-to-face contact.  “lot of people have no personal contact with them. Newcomers are separated in buildings and so on, so we only see each other on the street.” Integration is key and Jörg has some of his own ideas on how we could start to encourage it.

"think that integration will work better if we promote decentralized housing to bring the different cultures closer together.”

He hopes the work is doing will inspire more companies to launch their own initiatives and engage with the current crisis. “We want to show and share our concept to them so that they will also start their own programs.”

With the incredible talent these interns possess, Jörg is hopeful that it won’t be long before a refugee makes their way into a managerial position – and some day, the Board.

Thanks to our extensive service network around the world, we can quickly and comprehensively offer expert factory or field service support, maintenance, repairs, replacements, modernizations and upgrades of components, such as gas, steam and wind turbines as well as generators, in large-scale and industrial power plants, and compressors for the oil and gas industry.
In addition to factory- and field-based services, also has extensive experience with remote monitoring and diagnostics. Our experts can detect even the smallest indicator that something may not be operating normally and follow up by recommending proactive solutions before the issue becomes serious. Furthermore, can analyze the data collected to draw trends on individual turbines as well as the overall fleet. The results contribute to enhanced turbine performance over the long term, thereby lowering the cost of energy.

We also continually look for ways to increase the performance of our customers’ operating plants in a market being driven primarily by an aging power plant fleet and the rising demand for increasing the efficiency of existing plants in order to combat climate change, conserve natural resources and meet the ever-growing need of an expanding global population. We will do this through life extensions and other advanced technologies to increase the efficiency and capacity of existing power plants, enabling them to generate substantially more electricity with the same amount of fuel. Such solutions pay off – economically and environmentally.

Overview
Life at When Janina Kugel, member of the Managing Board at Siemens, gave a talk at TEDxBerlin 2015 on the power of diversity, she shared a potent personal experience that’s informed her way of thinking since she was a child.
“It hit me at the age five. was walking home from kindergarten and passing a soccer field, where all the kids were playing soccer. So stopped there in really joyful anticipation of them to invite me to join their playing. And they did stop. And there was an awkward silence. And then, the first one shouted ‘little n*****’. And then the second one joined in and said ‘little n*****’. And then everyone else there was standing there and shouting ‘little n*****’. did not really get their point at that very moment, but felt that something was terribly wrong. And it hurt. So ran home, to tell my parents, but somehow knew this experience would not be the last one of its kind in my life.

Twenty years later, in my early years as a young professional in a consulting company, mostly white and male-dominant, was there and again was different than anyone else there. was young, inexperienced – and on top of that a woman. And remember the very first time that was invited to one of the senior meetings. was going into the conference room, obviously was there very early, and then all of the guys came in. Most of them were unknown to me. Most of them only greeted each other, some of them greeted me, and then they sat down at the conference table and then the last one came in; he looked at me and said ‘Hey young lady, I’d like to have my coffee with milk please.’”
”
These moments of exclusion seem to be crushing at a first glance, but they are priceless at a second glance. would not be who am today nor where am today without those experiences.
Janina Kugel, 
Chief Human Resources Officer
People who’ve had real experiences dealing with being different, Janina argues, will excel as leaders. In this inspiring TEDx talk, she shares her tips for working with a diverse workforce, and the lessons to be learned from cultivating that difference at work.

Overview
Imagine an internet of things that, every day, adds five million more devices. Imagine a world where the cost of energy, transportation, goods, services and communication continues to drop, and where big data is smart. Imagine a world where artificial intelligence drives the next generation of automation and developments like synthetic biology push health and quality of life to new heights.  This world isn’t coming in the future.  It’s already here.

Having grown from an entrepreneur’s vision into an industrial innovator with lines of business that impact nearly every facet of people’s lives, has an important role to play in helping to shape the fourth industrial revolution and positioning the United States as a leader.

To drive innovation, is focusing on three key areas:
leveraging partnerships to expand investment in research and development;
helping the United States regain its global leadership role in manufacturing by leading the digital transformation;
and fostering the growth of entrepreneurship.

Like many plucky startups today, came from humble beginnings. The company was launched in a backyard in Berlin in 1847. That entrepreneurial spirit made into what it is today and it’s the reason we are compelled to foster future generations of world-changing innovations. That vision for entrepreneurship is why created an independent innovation unit within the company, next47, to pursue partnerships with startups to rapidly commercialize emerging technology.

With a billion dollars in support over the next five years, next47 combines the raw digital talent of startups with Siemens’ industrial domain knowledge. Part of the goal is to incentivize more and more tech resources to focus on new challenges that will drive social value: from the care you receive at the hospital, to the competitiveness of manufacturing, to the way we ship goods or drive to work,to how to add more renewable energy to the power grid.

Digitalization is transforming industrial service, just as it has consumer industries. For example, in its power generation service business, is now using augmented reality (AR) helmet technology in gas turbine training and field service operations.  Through AR, technicians can utilize more accessible, intuitive training instructions. The smart helmet technology helps workers increase speed, efficiency and accuracy – maximizing the availability and productivity of assets.  This is just one of several new digital tools that support Siemens’ push to develop data-driven digital services to help customers be more productive.  

also recently launched Digital Rail Services in the U.S., a new business that will use intelligent sensors and advanced software platforms to put intelligence behind billions of data points created on the country’s rail systems. This insight will help rail operators across the improve their operations and create an “Internet of Trains” to bring infrastructure and vehicles into the digital era. Powered by software tools, the Digital Service business will help rail operators reduce unplanned downtime, improve operational efficiency, enable improved business planning and performance, as well as generate energy and cost savings.

To support this new business, opened a new locomotive service facility in New Castle where technicians and engineers will monitor locomotive data and apply both digital analytics and extensive industry knowledge to move rail further into the digital age. New Castle also will serve as a training facility for digital skills. In fact, before Siemens’ field technicians go to customer sites, they’ll go to New Castle to train using virtual reality equipment. Goggles will take them inside each customer’s locomotives. Handheld controls will enable them to work on switches, components and panels.

Resilient infrastructure is not an option. It is a must!
Roland Busch, Member of the Managing Board of AG
Facing the challenge
Urban infrastructure systems and their effective and reliable operation ensure delivery of energy, mobility, water, sanitation and information, on a daily basis and during unplanned or unforeseeable situations. Yet with an ever-increasing frequency, businesses and communities face emergencies such as extreme weather-related events. City leaders have to find a new way of thinking about how to plan, design, build and manage their cities under more challenging conditions.
enables cities to boost their resilience by bringing international know-how directly to city managers. Our task is to help urban areas become more resilient to the physical, social, and economic challenges that are a growing part of the 21st century. We work with public organizations as well as private companies in helping cities, their people, communities and institutions respond to the stresses and acute shocks caused by rapid urbanization, globalization, and climate change. For us, resilience is not only about surviving – it is also about thriving, regardless of the challenge.
Standing up to the test
When critical infrastructure, like power and water supplies, can continue functioning in times of emergency, it goes a long way in minimizing disruption and ultimately saving lives.
Water Management System
Water Management System
Water management in cities includes a number of critical and interrelated services:
1. Collection, treatment & distribution of drinking water
2. Removal, treatment and disposal or reuse of wastewater
3. Removal, treatment and disposal or reuse of rainwater (stormwater)
4. Protection of people and critical facilities from flooding.
The Grid Electricity System
Energy is fundamental for life in cities and is essential for water & wastewater treatment and distribution; train, tram and metro networks; communications; medical and emergency services; lighting, heating, ventilation and security.
The grid electricity system includes 3 primary activities:
1. Generation,
2. Transmission,
The Transportation Network
The transportation network is a highly diverse system, composed of fixed assets (roads, railways, bridges, ports) and moving parts (trains, buses, cars, boats and bicycles).
Both must be operational to enable the network to function also in case of emergency. Diversity provided by multi-modal services and systems can help during unexpected system outages. Successful navigation is facilitated by integrated travel information.
Building Systems
Buildings house the infrastructure required to bring energy and water to consumers, and provide the destination points for most transportation systems.
In emergency situations where buildings remain safe, structurally sound and energy supply is maintained, technology can help to maintain occupant comfort and distribute information about emergency response. To minimize large scale disruption in services, safe, resilient and energy efficient data centers are essential.

The grid electricity system
Avoiding power failure
Energy is the backbone of life in cities, affecting every area of their infrastructure. Water distribution, public transport, communications and medical services for instance all require a reliable and resilient energy supply – it is vital for communities and businesses alike. The overall energy supply in urban areas is diverse and comprises a number of sources and modes: ranging from centralized power plants, to oil and gas for heating, or local power generation and heat networks. However, if a distribution network is affected by severe weather events, millions of customers may lose power and be literally left standing in the dark.
Remote monitoring and energy storage provide back-up supplies
Making urban electricity systems more resilient and sustainable calls for a shift towards distributed, automated and remotely controlled energy systems. Microgrid infrastructure , whereby small, independent electricity or heat grids distribute locally generated energy to nearby customers, can ensure a constant power supply even if the main power grid is under stress. In the event of a major catastrophe at a centralized plant or in the transmission network, microgrids could channel energy to critical services, such as hospitals and other emergency services.
Remote monitoring, the flexible integration of decentralized energy and energy storage devices present opportunities to increase the resilience of energy supply while at the same time improving efficiency and adopting cleaner sources of power. During extreme weather, like hurricanes or other major substation events, mobile resilience transformers can replace units within days rather than weeks. For example, is providing Con Edison, the utility that powers New York City and local areas, with compact, light and environment-friendly transformers. The mobile resilience transformers  allow Con Edison to respond to events in which multiple transformers are impacted and normal spares or system redundancy may not be able to address the issues.
Intelligent transportation networks
Mobility underpins the social and economic activity of any city around the world, making an unobstructed and sustainable transport infrastructure its lifeline. Yet despite most city transportation networks comprising a variety of mode and pathway options, many travelers and freight transport tend to depend on a familiar route. Add to this the reliance on stable energy and fuel supplies, transportation services are a highly sensitive and easily disrupted system. With recent evidence suggesting that the frequency and severity of extreme weather events will be increasing noticeably, special attention needs to be paid to cities’ transport networks. Intelligent systems that forecast and respond to the impact of damaging weather events can ensure that periods of disruption are minimized and long-term economic sustainability is not undermined.
Secondary power supply
secondary power supply for transportation networks enables trains to function through catastrophes that could disrupt grid functionality. The London Underground for instance is backed up by a separate power supply at Greenwich Power Station, which generates power specifically for the Underground. This back-up supply not only ensures trains running even through extreme weather events, but can also provide energy supply for more critical facilities, such as hospitals and evacuation centers.
In times of crisis, coordination of transportation is essential. Co-location of system operators can enable instant, shared decision-making for active transport management, enhancing passenger service with fewer disruptions. This was proven by the Transport Coordination Center (TCC) of the 2012 London Olympic Games, where event delivery partners and transportation organizations shared a single control room to coordinate operations, track incidents, and manage service times and vehicle capacity.
Automated system controls
In response to the chaotic evacuation of the Houston metropolitan area in Texas during Hurricane Ike, vehicle-to-infrastructure communications were developed as a pilot project. Intersections were equipped with a simple control system that dynamically alters the timing of traffic lights and uses Bluetooth signals to allow drivers access to real-time information on traffic volume, and also detect signals from emergency vehicles to turn green and facilitate rapid response.
Maintaining health, comfort and a constant information flow
Buildings provide essential shelter and structure while shaping the culture and physical character of the city. They are a crucial element of resilient infrastructures since they are the hubs that bring energy and water to consumers and provide destination points for most transportation systems. When equipping or modernizing buildings or entire cities to the highest standards of resilience, it is paramount to have a comprehensive understanding of hazardous and emergency situations in order to be able to react and evacuate safely and with the highest possible speed. Technologies have to be taken into account as much as the site and the design of buildings. provides a range of technology solutions that help to support the resilience of building systems, and ensure their ongoing functionality.
Disaster prevention and emergency evacuation
Taipei 101, a 101 story tower in Taiwan, sees 40,000 people pass through its doors each day. Fire prevention and emergency reaction plans have been of utmost importance since the start of construction in 2000, offering a ‘layered’ approach to fire safety and ensure rapid response in the event of a disaster. Among many other features, Taipei 101 is equipped with very early warning fire detection systems, smoke detection and expulsion systems and automated fire extinguishing systems, which are coordinated via a central disaster prevention center.
Advanced 3simulation software
Yet a rapid response also depends on correctly assessing the behavior of building occupants during an emergency. This can be modeled prior to an event, using advanced 3simulation software. The software enables movement through a building or space to be forecast up to ten times faster than real time with relative accuracy. Using this information, evacuation strategies may be planned and communicated to building users to ensure a rapid flow of people to safety. The approach has been implemented with a number of high rise buildings, including 1 Canada Square at Canary Wharf, which until 2012 was the tallest building in London.
In order to deliver targeted messages to advise building occupants during a crisis, Mass Notification Systems (MNS) can be implemented like for instance at Medicine Hat College in Alberta, Canada. Messages are disseminated through multiple redundant channels, including voice systems, signage and local area networks or even via personal devices such as cell phones. Systems inform occupants about what action they should take, therefore coordinating movement to facilitate safe and efficient response.
Some of the most important features of Data centers are service reliability and data security. Built-in solutions protect against power supply interruptions, security and fire safety threats, and ensure that servers operate at the correct temperature. The Safe Host data center in Geneva, Switzerland for instance, features a central management system, over 800 smoke detectors and video surveillance at all major entrances.
Ensuring a continuous water supply
Supplying drinking water and treating wastewater is a global challenge and critically important to all urban areas, particularly when keeping in mind the shortage of water we will face in the coming years. Through decentralized approaches, redundant infrastructure, automation and asset monitoring we can ensure a safe and continuous water supply, even in cases of irregularities, extreme weather or general water shortages. As industry experts for water applications, we offer powerful, innovative technical solutions.
Decentralized wastewater treatment
The Food Chain Reactor (FCR) solution for urban wastewater management combines conventional treatment methods with biological treatment. It is a decentralized approach, which manages wastewater on a neighborhood scale and helps to avoid the risk of sewer overflows and burst pipes during severe weather. The facility in Shenzen uses advanced automation to ensure reliable and efficient treatment of wastewater.
Continuous asset monitoring
Engineered flood defenses are highly effective in designed-for flood events, but the impact of peak flood levels can be severely worsened if dams fail. By embedding a comprehensive system of sensors in the walls of defenses as implemented in Livedijk, flood management operators can continuously monitor the behavior of the structures, gain real time reporting and trigger alarms in the event of damage or failure.Please use another Browser

City Performance Tool
worldwide challenge
In the years to come, urban communities will face explosive growth, not only in population but also in geographical size and economic output. With cities already generating around 80% of the global gross domestic product, it becomes obvious that they will be the backbone for economic growth and prosperity in the future. Our goal is to help cities evolve, and to offer them strategies and tools to ensure that they will become social, cultural and economic hubs.

City Performance Tool
All over the world, cities are shaped by profound forces: their population, their technologies and their infrastructures. Even today, these forces collide and urbanization and climate change will spur dramatic changes in metropolitan areas. Cities need to pave the way for constant evolution: digital technologies are becoming increasingly important and urban infrastructures and buildings require a more efficient and sustainable setup.
These changing environments set free a swarm of urban challenges: Developed cities for instance need to focus on cutting carbon emissions, improving efficiency in infrastructure and buildings, stimulating a market shift towards cleaner vehicles and more efficient and environmentally friendly public transportation. At the same time, infrastructure quality in many advanced economies is deteriorating. Looking forward to 2030, more than $50 trillion will need to be invested in infrastructure globally to keep up with and population growth.
Cities in emerging markets on the other hand face issues such as power outages and inadequate public transport and roads, which brake on growth and development. Infrastructures cannot be built fast enough to keep pace with economic and urban development. In times of constrained budgets city leaders carefully need to identify their infrastructure investments ensuring that their investments address their environmental and economic priorities. Technologies need to be adapted to serve local needs to ensure that the right technologies are applied in the right environments, tailored to the specific characteristics of the individual city.
To tackle these questions, has developed an interactive and comprehensive tool – the City Performance Tool (CyPT). It gives guidance to a city on how to achieve their environmental targets while providing an indication on how each infrastructure-related decision will influence job creation and the infrastructure sector growth.
The City Performance Tool
is a leading-edge simulation tool that can be used in many different decision-making scenarios
evaluates buildings, transport and energy technologies in a city through more than 70 technologies deployed at the desired time period and required implementation level
measures the impacts of a city’s strategic plans, and compare traditional methods with state-of-the-art technologies
determines the implementation rate needed for any city to meet its future environmental targets
reports both environmental and economic KPIs across transport, building and energy sectors

The City Performance Tool of shows a way forward by going beyond a simple carbon footprint. The inclusion of further pollutants (PM10 and NOx) and further sustainability dimensions (cost efficiency and job creation) goes definitely in the right direction.

Chair of Sustainable Engineering, Berlin
The City of Aarhus has the ambition to become carbon neutral bei 2030 and the City Performance Tool has shown that this target is realistic. However, the city will need to further electrify its transport and entice the private sector to do the same.

Every city is different in its own way. Understanding this local context is essential for delivering the right infrastructure solutions. Technologies need to be tailored to the specific requirements of each city. The City Performance Tool considers over 400 data points and more than 70 different technologies, evaluating buildings, transport and energy technologies in a city.
The City Performance Tool compiles data from publicly available municipal and national sources from 2012 to 2015.

Overview
believes in investing in current and future workers.  And in the U.S., Siemens’ holistic approach to industrial reskilling is focused on five areas:
TRAINING: Investing approximately $50 million annually to provide training and continuing education for employees.
& UNIVERSITIES: Helping students gain classroom experience working with both the software and hardware they’ll encounter in advanced industry. Software’s Global Academic Partnership Program provides software to more than one million students yearly at more than 3,000 global institutions, where it is used at every academic level – from grade schools to graduate engineering research programs. has committed to grant an additional $2 billion worth of industrial software to educators. The 
Cooperates with Education
 program has equipped more than 500 colleges and technical schools in the United States with the same technology used by industry giving students and teachers valuable credentials urgently needed by manufacturers. 
VETERANS: Hiring more than 2,500 veterans in the last 5 years and committing to hire 300 veterans per year for the next three years, and training them on the technical skills they need to work in Siemens’ business.
APPRENTICESHIPS: Expanding a apprenticeship program based on the successful German model by nearly doubling the total number of participants in its apprenticeship programs.
STEM: Shining a spotlight through the Foundation on the opportunities for young adults in middle-skills careers – and on training models that work. The Foundation has invested more than $100 million in the to advance workforce development and education initiatives in science, technology, engineering and math.

What many Americans traditionally think of as blue-collar jobs now go by different names –technical or middle-skills.  While many jobs require a bachelor’s degree, a large percentage of these positions, half by some counts, are obtainable by earning an associate’s degree, completing an apprenticeship program or completing training programs at community colleges.  This can be done inexpensively without adding to the $1.3 trillion in student debt now shared by 42 million Americans.

In order to help advance opportunities for young adults in middle-skill careers, the Foundation launched a workforce development program, the Middle-Skill Initiative in 2015, to leverage the experience and expertise of as an industry leader and pioneer in workforce development.  The Initiative addresses three clear objectives – elevating the economic opportunity available in technical careers in the national dialogue; rebranding the image of these jobs and educational pathways to one of prestige; and accelerating training models that work.

An important part of what both the Foundation and Siemens’ businesses are trying to achieve is to generate a new sense of national pride in middle skills, education and careers in industry. In the United States, pursuing alternatives to four-year universities such as an apprenticeship program is still too often seen as an inferior pathway. Even as middle skill and positions grow rapidly, enrollment in technical training programs remains flat.

To shine a light on exemplary young adults in programs at top community colleges and promote the real story of opportunity available in middle-skill careers, the Foundation created the Technical Scholars project in partnership with the Aspen Institute’s College Excellence Program.  The Foundation is also a proud supporter of the Aspen Prize for Community College Excellence.

The Foundation also works with the National Governors Association’s (NGA) Center for Best Practices on scaling work-based learning in states to expand the use of effective training models for young adults in fields.  Through this partnership, and the are working with Indiana, Iowa, Montana, New Hampshire, Utah and Washington to make effective work-based learning models for an integrated part of their education and training systems.  

The Foundation is eager to continue to work with public and private partners across government, economic development organizations, schools and others to continue building a 21st century workforce and enhancing opportunities in America.

Today, 70 percent of high school graduates go straight to college, but only 50 percent of these students graduate and do so with an average $30,000 in student debt. Siemens’ apprenticeships provide students a different pathway to the workforce via middle skills, which represent half of all job openings nationwide anticipated through 2022. Middle skills positions require more than a high school education yet less than a four-year degree with a strong technical skill set.

started its apprenticeship program in Charlotte, North Carolina. The company then expanded its apprenticeship program to four more states – and soon will be in a total of 9 states. Graduates earn an international industry certification, an associate’s degree and an apprenticeship completion certificate. They graduate with no debt and with a guaranteed job at Siemens, with a starting salary of around $55,000 a year.

provides on-the-job training while designing curriculums in partnership with community college partners to train workers in modern manufacturing skills. This is helping to both close the skills gap and inspire young people to pursue opportunities in advanced manufacturing.

also wanted to encourage other companies to replicate these efforts nationwide.  So the company worked with Alcoa, Dow, the National Association of Manufacturers, and the Department of Labor to develop a playbook for other manufacturers seeking to launch similar programs.

Overview
Technological progress, globalization and population growth present unprecedented sustainability challenges – from natural resource depletion, to energy conservation, to the degradation of the environment. And yet, with America’s abundant energy reserves, industrial leadership and influence in global affairs, the country has an opportunity to set a new course for sustainability.  has been privileged to work closely with customers around the world in offering attainable solutions and meaningful partnerships as we all work toward the vitally important goal of reducing emissions and fighting climate change.

Siemens’ commitment is not contingent on international treaties or regulations. The company does this because it is important to the planet, the country, to communities and to families. The products creates, the technologies invented, and the challenges solved will not only lay the path to environmental preservation, but to energy independence and economic security as well. This pursuit will develop new markets, inspire new products, create new jobs, and foster new career opportunities.

In practical terms, Siemens’ environmental sustainability mission is broken down into three key areas:
reducing harmful emissions;
using energy efficiency to conserve resources;
and preserving America’s precious and limited natural resources.
Siemens’ goal is to be the first major industrial company in the world to achieve a net zero carbon footprint by 2030.  The company is working to get halfway to that goal just three years from now, in 2020.  This is an extraordinarily ambitious task considering has more than 60 manufacturing sites in the alone.

In order to cut our carbon emissions in half by 2020, plans to drive energy efficiency programs, leverage distributed energy systems, reduce fleet emissions and purchase renewable energy.

Here in the U.S., the company is installing distributed and renewable-energy systems at a number of its facilities. As a model, the company looks to its rail manufacturing plant in Sacramento, which is powered in part by solar energy.  

The cleanest energy is energy that isn’t needed. Large buildings are the biggest users of energy across our communities.  Thus, the quickest, most cost-effective way to use less energy and extend the country’s energy supply is to make those facilities more energy-efficient.  Siemens’ Building Technologies has already helped customers save more than $2 billion in energy and operational costs.  In Charlotte, built a certified manufacturing facility to Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) standards to cut both costs and emissions during construction and operation. Looking forward, these are the kinds of activities the company looks to scale.

Fighting climate change and sustaining the environment is the right thing to do.  And, has the right people to do it.

The expectations for how the grid should work and what it should be capable of are as high as they’ve ever been. But consumers aren’t willing to wait for the larger grid to become smarter, an effort that will take time—decades—to complete. Whether their concern is climate change, resiliency, or cost, they’re eager to reap the benefits of a digital grid today. There is, however, an alternative to waiting. The solution is to put customers back in power. enables customers to stay connected to the grid while also having the capability of generating and managing power themselves using the latest technologies and software. Customers can now have more control over how they manage their energy supply, how they use it, and how much they pay for it. And critically, they are shielded from damaging storms and severe weather. That’s why is working on:
Creating renewable energy solutions and combined heat and power systems that are as much as 90 percent more efficient versus traditional power generation;
Developing software and automated controls for assets such as microgrids that intelligently manage power supplies, increase reliability and reduce carbon footprints;
Providing storage technology to help customers reliably deploy renewable energy sources

Blue Lake Rancheria, a 100-year-old Native American reservation in Northern California, has launched its low-carbon community microgrid to help power government offices, economic enterprises, and critical Red Cross safety shelter-in-place facilities across 100 acres. The microgrid allows the reservation to operate independently of the power grid in coordination with local utility Pacific Gas & Electric. The project integrates the largest solar array in Humboldt County, California and is estimated to save the Tribe over $200,000 in annual energy costs and reduce at least 150 tons of carbon per year.

The microgrid will provide energy savings for the Tribe through peak shaving and demand response during business-as-usual situations and emergency power for critical facilities for months if necessary in climate change-induced or other emergency situations.

The deployment of this technology is made feasible by the introduction of intelligent software to manage and control a vast array of energy resources. With Siemens’ intelligent microgrid management software, Blue Lake Rancheria is able to rely on a complex mix of generation and storage to work together to deliver efficient, reliable and cleaner power for the Tribe's government offices, its casino, hotel and event center, and other critical infrastructure. The software is able to accurately predict the reservation's power load needs and dynamically manage and control its distributed power generation through integrated weather data and load forecasting, and use case and load shed scenarios. The Reservation will use this detailed power usage insight to provide its residents and businesses with reliable, high quality power without fear of outages or power interruption.

Blue Lake Rancheria’s microgrid deployment and its success is a direct result of an industry-leading collaborative approach between tribal, federal, state, and local entities, university partners, technology providers, and electric utilities. This public and private partnership can provide a model for microgrid deployments.

The definition of the perfect place is unique to your patients. Your students. Your customers. Each person you provide a place for needs peace of mind to believe that their hospital room is just the right temperature.  That their walk across campus is secure.  That their integrated systems remain operational.  And that their data centers provide the perfect environment for their servers. 
The freedom to create the perfect place is critical.
Pine Grove Middle School is one of seven schools in the East Syracuse Minoa Central School District in New York, educating 3,750 students every year.
With a realization that the world has undergone dramatic changes – not least in the world of employment, and the skills required – the educators at Pine Grove made a decision that education needed to change. Pine Grove changed its teaching methods: Less instruction. More imagination. Less repetition. More collaboration. Less memorizing. More creativity. 
Teaching for a changed world demands a changed teaching environment. With this in mind, the school district entered into an ongoing partnership with Siemens.
provides building technology to create a new environment at Pine Grove where the students can concentrate, collaborate, think, create… and learn. 
Ensuring that education prepares students for the world that’s waiting for them.

With people spending about 90 percent of their lives indoors, there is no place where we spend more time in our life. So buildings are far more than just four walls. They are the places where we learn the most important lessons in life, where we encounter the personalities that inspire us, where the best of our ideas are born.
We create results: Cost savings of 31 percent. Lighting power usage cut by 21 percent.  CO

Buildings account for 41 percent of energy consumption worldwide, and produce a third of greenhouse gas emissions. As public opinion calls for more environmental transparency and accountability from public and commercial organizations, improving your buildings’ efficiency is a necessary move. But it is also a smart one: With energy accounting for up to 30 percent of a building's lifecycle cost, performance optimization is a critical step in not just meeting sustainability expectations and emissions reduction targets - but a key lever to improve financial, regulatory and reputational standing.

Find out more about energy efficiency, sustainable buildings and how to turn your buildings into true assets.

Upstate New York is known for its temperature extremes with sweltering summers and nine-foot snowdrifts in the winter. To ensure that students are comfortable and focused, temperature control is an important element. And as a state-funded educational institution, energy efficiency  is just as important to the school. Because the $500,000 saved on energy every year can be invested directly into improving the educational environment.
Since East Syracuse Minoa School District (ESM) is a learning organization, enhancing its overall educational environment for the students is a key concern for the district. By partnering with to make energy-efficient facility improvements has been able to not only save money, but realize their vision by implementing a new teaching and learning model.

developed an integrated learning approach teaching subjects collaboratively to help students develop their (Science, Technology, Research, Engineering, Arts and Math) knowledge, as well as problem-solving and presentation skills and abilities. partnered with to transform the curriculum, from pre-kindergarten through grade 12, to develop true transdisciplinary projects through consultative support and hosting symposiums.

In 2008, was looking for a business and technology partner who could help them enhance energy efficiency in all of its eight buildings with a solution that would also contribute to the overall learning process for students and staff.
In addition to reducing energy costs, also wanted to fund building and energy efficiency improvements through energy savings, improve energy conservation and provide energy awareness and education for the students, faculty, and staff. In addition, the district wanted to create community awareness for its energy and environmentally responsible programs and demonstrate the use of alternative energy technologies. retrofitted the lighting throughout the district, and implemented premium efficiency motors as well as variable frequency drive pumps and fans. New windows and doors and a district-wide energy management system as well as new boiler plants in four buildings help to save as much electricity in a month as 6.2 average American homes consume in a whole year. In addition, installed a 25 ksolar power system to further demonstrate ESM’s sustainability efforts.

The relationship between the educators at Pine Grove and isn’t simply that of customer and supplier. And the scope of the work didn’t end with the installation of the last piece of technology. is a true partner to Pine Grove and works with the administration, educators and community for the entire district. Listening. Advising. Exploring. In areas that impact not just the building, but the students and teachers, too. Because just as a child isn’t educated overnight, there’s something else that needs to be long term, too. Partnership.

Personnel safety is a critical issue at a liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal. As demand grows for greater natural gas supplies, we will witness more terminals coming online and as a result, an increase in exports. This would make the the third-largest exporter in the world by 2020, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. terminals will be challenged to implement more stringent risk-based evaluations regarding design, their location, operations, and health, safety and environment (HSE) impacts.
Strategic services and innovation products & solutions create perfect places for terminals

Siemens’ Advanced Signal Analysis (ASA) detection can quickly and reliably detect smoke, heat, and carbon monoxide. We are so confident of our intelligent, multi-criteria detector technology that we guarantee its accuracy by covering any fines associated with a false alarm at your site that is triggered by an technology detector (certain factors should apply). Nine selectable parameter sets makes the detectors immune to deceptive phenomena, which in turn prevents unnecessary downtimes and costs caused by false alarms.
part of the downstream cycle of the petroleum industry, oil refineries are typically large, sprawling industrial complexes with extensive piping running throughout, carrying streams of fluids between large chemical processing units. They continuously process approximately about 100,000+ barrels of crude oil daily.
