Creativity is at our core.
It changes the way we think. It influences our work, our actions and the people we’re                                     becoming. Creativity empowers us, drives us and opens us to combine different ideas,                                     try new things and look at the world from a wide range of perspectives.
At Skidmore, no matter what you’re meant to be, do or inspire – Creative Thought Matters.                                     And that makes all the difference.

Creative Thought Matters
"Creative Thought Matters" is not just a slogan at College—it's something
                           we believe in wholeheartedly. It is a way of life. It is a brand promise to students
                           that no matter what they choose to study, they will be active participants in an academic
                           and extracurricular environment that is richly influenced by literature, arts, culture
                           and ideas. What they learn will be brought to life by Skidmore's historic and highly
                           prized "hand and mind" tradition that values and rewards real-world actions and outcomes.

Creativity is at our core.
It changes the way we think. It influences our work, our actions and the people we’re                                     becoming. Creativity empowers us, drives us and opens us to combine different ideas,                                     try new things and look at the world from a wide range of perspectives.
At Skidmore, no matter what you’re meant to be, do or inspire – Creative Thought Matters.                                     And that makes all the difference.

Mission Statement
The principal mission of College is the education of predominantly full-time
                                 undergraduates, a diverse population of talented students who are eager to engage
                                 actively in the learning process. The college seeks to prepare liberally educated
                                 graduates to continue their quest for knowledge and to make the choices required of
                                 informed, responsible citizens. faculty and staff create a challenging yet
                                 supportive environment that cultivates students’ intellectual and personal excellence,
                                 encouraging them to expand their expectations of themselves while they enrich their
                                 academic understanding.
                              
In keeping with the college’s founding principle of linking theoretical with applied
                                 learning, the curriculum balances a commitment to the liberal arts and sciences
                                 with preparation for professions, careers, and community leadership. Education in
                                 the classroom, laboratory, and studio is enhanced by cocurricular and field-experience
                                 opportunities of broad scope.
                              
The college also embraces its responsibility as an educational and cultural resource
                                 for alumni and for a host of nontraditional student populations, and for providing
                                 educational leadership in the Capital District and beyond.

Preservation matters: 
How shaped Saratoga
(
The Saratogian,
There would be no College were it not for a frail lady with a will of iron
                           who came to Saratoga Springs in 1900 to take the healing waters, fell in love with
                           the charms of the unique resort town and decided to remain.
                        
The daughter of a wealthy coal merchant and widow of publishing scion Blair Scribner,
                           Lucy Scribner was almost 50 when she came to Saratoga. Deeply religious, inordinately
                           shy and physically restricted, she disliked frivolous parties and frowned on two of
                           the most popular local entertainments and industries, horse racing and gambling. She
                           decided to invest her inheritance in something more worthwhile: She would start a
                           school where young women of the town could learn skills that would make them self-supporting.
                        
So with the help of other civic-minded neighbors, Lucy Scribner created the Young
                           Women's Industrial Club of Saratoga Springs, whose first curriculum was a blend of
                           practical courses in typewriting, bookkeeping, textile arts, physical education and
                           music and dance. Today we may snicker at the courses in sewing, shirtwaist making
                           and millinery, but these were among the few fields in which women could manage businesses,
                           and those courses were embedded in a broader context of creative expression and aesthetic
                           appreciation.

Who wouldn’t want to go to college in Saratoga? 10-minute walk from College
                           puts you in the heart of a downtown brimming with shops, great restaurants, galleries,
                           clubs and parks. 
Travel & Leisure
 calls Saratoga Springs one of “America’s Greatest Main Streets” as well as “one of
                           the best college towns in the nation,” 
Money Magazine
 says it’s one of the nation’s top 100 places to live, and

There’s real history here, too: famed mineral waters, a Revolutionary War battlefield,
                           and the nation’s oldest thoroughbred racetrack. Want arts and culture? The Saratoga
                           Performing Arts Center (SPAC) is the summer home to the New York City Ballet, Philadelphia
                           Orchestra, and a performing venue for top rock and jazz musicians. And there’s Caffè
                           Lena, the nation’s oldest continuously operating coffeehouse, a place that helped
                           launch the careers of Bob Dylan and Ani DeFranco.
                        
The location? Boston, New York City and Montreal are no more than a three-hour car
                           ride from campus. And the nearby Adirondacks, Berkshires and Green Mountains provide
                           plenty of recreational opportunities including some of the best skiing and hiking
                           in the Northeast. New York’s state capital, Albany, is just 30 miles to the south.
                        
An incredible place to spend four years.

                                    Springs. As part of its mission, the college seeks to contribute to the quality of

NextMabaso, a senior from South Africa, offers advice for future international students and laughs at a few experiences in the United States that caught her by surprise.
November 5, 2018
by Harry Mooney '21
friend from home came to visit me last winter. “It’s like the cafeteria on a beautiful                                        space ship,” she said.
As she took in the intricate wood and metal detailing, the ambiance of the interior                                        decor and the abundant natural light pouring in from the windows, felt a light sense                                        of pride. Seeing it through her eyes was like seeing it for my first time, too.
In that moment, realized that the Murray-Aikins Dining Hall (D-Hall) adds something irreplaceably special to my life at Skidmore. It is one of Skidmore’s                                        most brilliant gems. love it. And I’m certainly not the only one who feels this                                        way. 
It's ranked at the top  by The Princeton Review, Niche.com and others with chefs who have  repeatedly brought home gold medals in culinary competitions.
spot where you can grab a light breakfast before class or recover after a long sports                                        practice, D-Hall is here for everyone and all lifestyle varieties.
One of the reasons students are so appreciative of D-Hall is its accommodating                                        schedule.
Except for the hour between 4–5 p.m., when it is being cleaned and prepped for dinner,                                        D-Hall is open 7 a.m. – 11 p.m. during the week.
often leave campus early in the morning to hike and return late at night. Being                                        able to eat full, hot meals at those fringe times fills me with gratitude, especially                                        for the staff who wake up early and go to sleep late to feed us.
But what is the food actually like? Let me show you around.
Do you want some pizza? Then check out Supremo’s, serving hand-tossed, oven-baked                                        pizza all day. personally love the pepper and onion pies.
Looking for something healthy? Emily’s Garden is dedicated to vegan and vegetarian                                        options, and many of the meals are prepared with produce from our own community garden.
Take a few steps past Emily’s and you will find The Corner Deli, where you can order                                        your own sandwich, wrap or panini. Order anything you want. Mustard and Swiss cheese                                        on wheat? Not sure why you would want that, but I’m sure they’ll make it for you! 
After you’re done experimenting with sandwich combinations, move on to The Bakery.                                        Stocked with fresh-baked muffins, cookies, breads, pie, and cake, The Bakery is your                                        six-year-old self’s dream. Welcome to college: there are no parents. Have two chocolate                                        chip cookies instead of one. You’ll never look back.
The Diner is our main hot food station, serving everything from pork chops to tomato                                        soup, grilled cheese, burgers, baked potatoes, you name it. Every day and every meal                                        is different. The Diner is also home to Skidmore’s famous Chicken Finger Friday. Be                                        careful though, chicken fingers can be dangerous. Read what happened to this student after she ate too many.
Just around the corner from The Diner you’ll find rows and rows of cylindrical shelves                                        filled with all kinds of cereals and granolas. And don’t forget the fresh fruit.
Next up is my personal favorite: The Global Cafe. Dedicated to international foods,                                        my favorite dishes come from Global: veggie stir fry and pork fried rice. 
If you have gotten this far and your mouth isn't already watering, you will find Semolina’s:                                        our pasta station. For dinner, Semolina’s serves one kind of pasta dish. For lunch,                                        however, you can request a dish to order and our chefs and students will make you                                        a delicious custom plate. Everyone wants a spot in this line.
Lastly, if it is the case that still nothing interests you, there is a station                                        where you can cook your own eggs or omelets, or make some Belgian waffles. The only                                        limit is your imagination.
At D-Hall, no matter one’s dietary restrictions, nutritional plan, class and extracurricular                                        schedule, everyone finds accommodation. It is truly a wonderful building that has                                        facilitated so many interactions with great friends, new and old.
So far today I’ve had a veggie and chorizo scramble for breakfast and a gyro for lunch.                                        Is it time for dinner yet?
