In this new era of fast-evolving technology, the opportunities for extraordinary advancements in life sciences are unlimited — from breakthroughs in personal medicine and customized smart medical devices, to the rise of genomics and proteomics, to precise high throughput molecular analyses. But, as these technologies evolve, so does the need for more agile design and development. With quick and complex design, change-on-the-go integrations have the danger of failing fast without proper proficiency in a given specialty. Without solid and verified goals in mind, it can be difficult for teams to keep on track.
Though the list of opportunities — and their associated challenges — are nearly endless, the question is, how can companies – or entire industries – that are facing fast-evolving technical demands innovate, compete, and win? To answer this question, partnered with Forbes Insights to survey 180 executives from the life sector as well as pharmaceuticals and aviation/aerospace.
As with life science, the mission for these latter two industries requires the integration of complex processes, components, and technologies to deliver highly advanced products and services. All three industries rely on applied and manage multi-year product development timelines. All suffer from the occasional development delays or cost overruns, and all possess valuable, often breakthrough, intellectual property (IP).
We Learned the Time to Partner is Now
The Forbes Insights report sheds light on the degree to which companies in these sectors are using supply chain collaboration to achieve an array of benefits. From accelerated time to market, improved quality, and reduced risk, to improved margins and widespread innovation, it’s clear that those who collaborate and partner most perform best.
In the report “Unlocking Innovation in Your Supply Chain: Five Collaborative Insights for Life Science,” you’ll learn how research shows greater collaboration — even partnership between OEMs and their suppliers — is the way to go. The report goes in-depth on the following key insights:

© 2019  is a unit of Corporation.Keep Your Eye on Innovation.
Let us Handle the Integration.
Through strategic partnerships, engineers innovative components that result in optimized optofluidic systems. At Science, we don’t just build components; we also create innovative solutions that maximize performance and enable the complete optimization of the entire optofluidic pathway. We manufacture highly trusted products used in life instruments that perform precise sampling, reagent handling, optical analysis, sample processing, and many other analysis tasks.
Browse through our case studies below to see how partnership is the new innovation:
Optimized Materials
REQUIREMENT:
Our partner required rigid, high-tolerance sample probe arrays for biological analysis.
SOLUTION:
We developed composite metal/thermoplastic probe assemblies with the strength and precision of metal and the biological compatibility of a wetted flow path. These engineering innovations ensure reliable probe integrity, every time for every instrument.
Engineered Efficiency
REQUIREMENT:
Our partner required a compact, low pressure, low power consumption pump for diagnostics.
SOLUTION:
REQUIREMENT:
Our partner required alignment across applications from tens to hundreds of microns.
SOLUTION:
Our engineers installed a Ronchi Grating directly onto the consumable, allowing active alignment by autofocusing. Since the grating is located in a defined proximity to the detection channel, the instrument can easily detect the position of the disposable and fine-tune for optical read-out.
SOLUTION:
Our rotary shear valves provide complex flow-switching without accidental flow pumping. These features enhance applications that use multiple reagents, where carryover or accidental flow would hinder the analysis.
SOLUTION:
Our dynamic vacuum-level control system provides optimized degassing while protecting solvent composition. The result is extremely high quality degassing with minimal detriment, that greatly enhances run-to-run reliability.
REQUIREMENT:
Our partner needed storage of dry reagents for complex assays that are reliable, cost effective, and scalable.
SOLUTION:
Reagents are dispensed and dried onto reagent carriers called reagent plugs. These plugs are prepared independently from the cartridge in larger batches, functionalized on a titerplate format and assembled to the cartridge in a final assembly step. The processes for dry reagent preparation can be developed and performed independently of the cartridge manufacturing processes using standard equipment and has been proven to be scalable and compatible with industrial functionalization and assembly processes.
SOLUTION:
We used our expertise in engineered thermoplastics, process control, and manufacturing to create a fluidic manifold that met the demands of ultra-low-volume analysis and allowed the easy interchange of consumable microfluidic chips.
SOLUTION:
Our engineers designed a screw-driven pump with an energized seal and an ultra-smooth, ultra-hard piston that has unsurpassed life length and industry-leading precision.
Enhanced Sampling
REQUIREMENT:
Our partner asked us to help minimize carryover and fluid loss during sample introduction.
SOLUTION:
Our support team worked closely with the customer to teach valve operation, sample loop overfill, rinsing, and pressure equalization methods. These procedures were used in the instrument after collaborative validation, resulting in a significant increase in system reliability.
REQUIREMENT:
SOLUTION:
Our engineers developed two different approaches to this problem which are both equally well suited for mass manufacturing and facilitate completely sealed and self-contained cartridge designs. First, is fluid manipulation using a bellow. Bellow volume is modified by an instrument-based actuator and due to the hermetically sealed design of the consumable itself, this compression leads to a fluid manipulation. Second, is the implementation of a thin-film pump, also mechanically operated by the instrument, into a closed-loop fluidic network. Two layers of film being assembled to the consumable are deflected to form a pump cavity and are operated similar to a peristaltic pump.
REQUIREMENT:
Our partner required protection and preservation of reagent stability during manufacturing, assembly, and long-term storage.
SOLUTION:
Our lab-on-a-chips feature liquid reagents stored in both blister packs and in cavities on the chip. controlled release of the liquid reagent is achieved with a frangible seal on the channel which connects the blister to the rest of the fluidic network of the cartridge.My Cart
