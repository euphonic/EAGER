Page topNote of Caution about a Fraudulent Job Recruitment
Recently, it has come to our attention that a fraudulent job recruitment email by using a fake domain "info@hitachigroups.com" has been circulating in India, notifying job seekers of shortlisting and interviews in return for a refundable deposit.
does not use such a domain. Please note that will never request for monetary deposits (whether refundable or not) in return for interviews, shortlistings or promise of appointment.
