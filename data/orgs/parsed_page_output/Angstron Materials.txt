Dr. Bor Jang is a pioneer in graphene technology as he was the world's first to discover graphene in 2002. He is recognized as the world's number 1 graphene inventor with over 250 graphene-related patents and numerous international patents. On top of this, he is the co-inventor on over 300 patents on battery, fuel cell, and supercapacitor technologies. Prior to starting Global Graphene Group, Dr. Jang served as the head of Department of Mechanical Engineering and Applied Mechanics at North Dakota State University from 2002-20005 and was promoted to Dean of College of Engineering and Computer Science at Wright State University from 2005 until 2010 when he retired from academia. 
Dr. Aruna Zhamu
Co-Founder
Dr. Aruna Zhamu is one of the most accomplished female scientists in the world. Hailing from Mongolia, she is one of only a handful of scientists to hold over 150 patents. Behind Dr. Jang, she is recognized as the world's number 2 graphene inventor with over 200 graphene-related patents. Dr. Zhamu led to become the world's number 1 producer of graphene raw and co-invented numerous technologies including graphene-enabled high-capacity anodes, non-flammable electrolyte,lithium-sulfur batteries, and supercapacitors. Together, with Dr. Jang, the two Co-Founders have the knowledge and drive to bring Global Graphene Group.
Company Structure
Global Graphene Group was founded as a holding company in 2015 for Energy Company , Honeycomb Battery Company , Group , Nanotek Instruments , and Taiwan Graphene Company . Dr. Jang and Dr. Zhamu first founded Nanotek Instruments in 1997 and then in 2007. Since then, they founded Energy Company, Honeycomb Battery Company and Taiwan Graphene Company with the idea that each company would focus on a specific area of technology. The founding of Global Graphene Group brought together the 5 divisions under one holding company structure.
