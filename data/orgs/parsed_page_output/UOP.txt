University of Phoenix Trademark Usage
University of Phoenix Trademark Usage
Trademark Usage
This website contains general guidance for the proper use of University of Phoenix's various trademarks, service marks, and domain names. It is not intended as comprehensive guidance for all legal uses. Any questions regarding the proper use of these, or any other University of Phoenix marks or domain names not addressed here, should be directed to:
University of Phoenix Legal Services
ATTN: Tim West, Associate General Counsel
Unauthorized use of University Of Phoenix marks is not permitted.
Trademark Definitions
Trademark
trademark includes any word, name, symbol, device, or any combination, used, or intended to be used, in commerce to identify and distinguish the goods of one manufacturer or seller from goods manufactured or sold by others, and to indicate the source of the goods. In short, a trademark is a brand name.
Service Mark
service mark is any word, name, symbol, device, or any combination, used, or intended to be used, in commerce, to identify and distinguish the services of one provider from services provided by others, and to indicate the source of the services.
Registration (
®
) Symbol
The letter within a circle—®—is a symbol signifying federal trademark registration. The federal registration symbol is used once a mark (a trademark or service mark) is actually registered with the
Patent and Trademark Office. Even though an application for registration may be pending, a registration symbol may not be used before a mark has actually become registered. The registration symbol is typically superscripted to the right of the last letter of the mark.
Trademark (
TM
) and Service Mark (
SM
) Symbols
Trademark and Service mark symbols usually indicate that a party claims rights to a mark. These symbols are often used by a party before a federal registration is issued. There are no federal regulations governing the use of these symbols or designations, however, their use may be governed by local, state, or foreign laws. The 
TM
 or 
SM
 symbol is typically superscripted to the right of the last letter of the mark. These marks are commonly referred to as common law trademarks.
Attribution Notice
Notice identifying the registered owner of a mark. It is typically found at the bottom of the page on which a mark is used.
Common Law Trademarks
non-federally registered mark commonly identified by a 
TM
 or 

symbol.
Mark Use in Commerce
Use of a mark in commerce including use in presentations, information materials, books, marketing materials, advertisements, external Web sites, etc.
Trademark Guidelines
Trademarks and service marks (collectively known as marks), when properly used, are legally protected indefinitely. The improper use of a mark can cause it to become diluted or regarded as generic, thereby causing the mark to lose some or all of its legal protection status. The following guidelines are provided to promote the proper use of University Of Phoenix marks in commerce.
Use all University Of Phoenix marks with the appropriate symbols - 
®
, 
SM
 or 
TM
 as they are displayed in the University of Phoenix marks Inventory section of this Web site. The appropriate symbol is usually superscripted, and is placed to the right of the last letter of the mark. University Of Phoenix marks may be distinguished by using other typographic enhancements such as bold or italic type.
®
®
Trademarks are adjectives that describe a noun (i.e., a specific person, place, thing, or service).

Examples of proper use of the symbol (note that the symbol is not used when the mark is used as a noun):
®
 curriculum materials are available online for all students and faculty.

University of Phoenix allows students and faculty to retrieve curriculum materials online.
Do not use University Of Phoenix marks in the possessive or plural form.
Never combine (alter the mark by joining it with another mark) a University Of Phoenix mark with a trademark or service mark of a third party. Combining University Of Phoenix's marks with those of others may confuse consumers as to which company is the source of the product or service
In instances where University Of Phoenix may want to co-brand with a third party, a license agreement is necessary. Assistance can be obtained by contacting University Of Phoenix Legal Services.
Usage of University Of Phoenix marks for sponsorships (i.e. 10races, clean air campaigns, etc.) should be pre-approved by University Of Phoenix Legal Services.
Give proper attribution when using University Of Phoenix marks. An attribution notice should be placed in all material used in commerce that includes a University Of Phoenix mark.
®
 is a registered service mark of University of Phoenix, Inc. in the United States and/or other countries
®
 and UOPX
®
 are registered trademarks of University of Phoenix, Inc. in the United States and/or other countries.   
a. On single page material, the attribution notice should be placed at the bottom of the page, and should be separated by a line break from a copyright notice if one is used.

b. On multi-page material with a copyright page, the attribution notice should be placed on that page.

c. On multi-page material, usually 12 pages or less and without a  copyright page, the attribution notice may be placed on the last page or back of the material or as noted below.

d. On multi-page material of more than 12 pages and without a copyright page, the attribution notice must be placed at the base of the first page where the mark is used.

e. All material used in commerce that is published electronically or that may be used in countries outside the United States, and which includes a University of Phoenix mark, must include the following at the end of the attribution notice:

About Us
About University of Phoenix
Championing the success and goals of adult students
Committed to helping working adults meet their academic, professional, and personal goals.
About University of Phoenix
John Sperling, PhD, a Cambridge-educated economist, professor and entrepreneur, founded University of Phoenix in 1976 in response to the changing needs of the workplace. It was part of his commitment to provide adults with the higher education they would need to fill those needs and for forty years, that’s exactly what we’ve done.
The times have changed, but our objective has remained the same – to help people enhance their lives through education. Together we will keep working to fulfill Dr. Sperling’s vision, improve the lives of our students and strengthen our communities.
We are proud to provide students access to quality education, ongoing support and a range of resources to help them succeed. Through innovation and dedication we can continue to work toward a better tomorrow.
We invite you to learn about our University and see how we can help you pursue your education and follow your dreams.
An innovative approach to education
As an institution always focused on the needs of an adult learner population, our Instructional Framework reflects the instructional strategies most important for this population.
University of Phoenix was founded upon the vision of making higher education more available, even if you’re a professional with a full time commitment to work and family. With 40 years of experience, we continue to focus on meeting the needs of adult learners. Malcolm Knowles identified the characteristics of adult learners as differing from the classic 18-22 year-old college students; through areas such as the learner’s need to know, self-concept, experience, readiness to learn, orientation to learning and motivation. These characteristics influence the instructional design process – shifting our framework from content-driven to context-driven and reinforcing relevant application to the real world.
Developed by faculty who are practitioners in their field, our curriculum integrates academic theory, lifelong learning and professional practice – and is designed to support the needs of adult learners. We strive to help students develop relevant skills that can be easily applied to their current work and life experiences.
Our convenient classes, offered online or on-campus at selection locations, make going back to school a real option for working adults. Access your class online, study on your own schedule and earn your degree.
Although you might not be on campus, you’re never alone. We’re here to guide you from enrollment through graduation.  As a student you have access to our innovative learning platform, 
career services
 and wealth of educational resources such as an 
online library
, 
writing
 and 
math
 labs and a university-wide academic social network.
We offer 
associate
, 
bachelor’s
, 
master’s
 and 
doctoral
 degrees and a variety of 
certificate
 programs so that you can match your education to your interest and professional goals.
Contact us today to learn how we can help you create the future you deserve.
