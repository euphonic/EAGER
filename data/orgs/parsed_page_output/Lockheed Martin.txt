Ethics
Martin’s success depends on our commitment to integrity. Our 
core values
 – Do What’s Right, Respect Others and Perform with Excellence – are fundamental to who we are and what we do. At Martin, we believe that doing what’s right is more than just obeying laws and regulations. It’s holding ourselves to a higher standard, even when the law may not require us to do so. We refuse to allow our integrity to be compromised by our desire to succeed, regardless of the circumstances of our business.
Our 
Code of Ethics and Business Conduct
, 
Setting the Standard
, outlines our high expectations for employees and others who act on behalf of our company and provides the foundation for our award-winning Ethics program. We require all employees, consultants, contract laborers and Board members to agree to abide by our Code of Conduct.
We help them understand and mitigate the legal and regulatory risks they may face by providing interactive 
Business Conduct Compliance Training
 courses. And we use our annual leader-led 
Ethics Awareness Training
 to prepare employees to recognize and respond to situations that require ethical decision making.
We also communicate with employees year-round on key ethics and compliance topics, including but certainly not limited to 
Corruption
 and 
Human Trafficking
. Our episodic 
Integrity Minute
 series is one of the primary communications tools we use to keep Ethics top of mind.

            	When employees face ethical dilemmas in their workplace, they are encouraged to use the 
Voicing Our Values techniques
 - Ask Questions, Obtain Data, Talk to Others, and Reframe the Issue. If unable to resolve the conflict using these techniques, or in the event of a compliance breach, employees should report any possible violations to their manager, Human Resources Business Partner, Legal, Security, Internal Audit, or Ethics.

Martin: Our History
Our History
Over one hundred years ago, on August 16, 1912, Glenn established the Glenn Company in Los Angeles, California. He started the company after building his first plane in a rented church, where he took a leap of faith on his risky but innovative new aircraft design at the urging of none other than Orville Wright.
Four months later and four hundred miles away, on December 19, 1912, Allan and Malcolm founded the Alco Hydro-Aeroplane Company, later renamed the Aircraft Company. Talented mechanics, they set up shop out of a  garage, constructing seaplanes that would shatter speed and distance records for overwater flights.
church and a garage. These were humble beginnings. But these were also men of unrelenting vision and unwavering purpose. The gift that and the brothers shared was a unique ability to look past the obstacles of today to the promise of a brighter tomorrow. And they knew – as we’ve known for 100 years – that innovation, performance and purpose were the keys to accelerating that tomorrow.
