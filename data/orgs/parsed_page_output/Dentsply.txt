More than a century of storied history and innovative leadership
For more than a century, and Sirona have set a global standard for dental manufacturing, technology development, digital treatment and clinical education. Throughout our history, we have been at the forefront of innovation to improve and advance dentistry.
Sirona traces its roots to humble beginnings – was founded as Dentists’ Supply Company in 1899 in New York City and the company that became Sirona Dental Systems was founded in 1877 in Erlangen, Germany. Through the transformative merger in 2016, Sirona has grown to become the world’s largest manufacturer of professional dental products and technologies with approximately 16,000 employees, operations in more than 40 countries worldwide and a sales presence in more than 120 countries.
Throughout the last century as separate companies, and Sirona have each invested significantly in innovation, new product development – from the first dental drill to the first reciprocating root canal file to of course the first chairside CAD/system – and the broadest clinical education platform in the industry. Both companies recognized early on that the advantages of digitization are not in the individual device, but in the seamless interaction of hardware, software and devices creating an innovative solution for dental practitioners and dental patients.
At the heart of Sirona is our unwavering commitment to innovation. As a result, our impact is significant: Every year our products and solutions reach 600,000 dental professionals who treat over 6,000,000 patients daily! Which translates to a billion patients each year. Practitioners rely on the quality and clinical safety of our products and on the company's more than 100 years of experience. We are committed to continue to earn the trust of dental professionals for the next 100 years.

Some significant innovations of the past years are, amongst others, the first Compomer Dyract (1993) with its caries protecting effect by fluoride release, Prime&Bond (1995), the first one-bottle Total Etch Adhesive, Aquasil Ultra (2002), the GuttaCore obturator (2009), the first self-levelling bulk-fill flowable (2010), the hybrid x-ray system 3(2010), the treatment center (2011), the sintering furnace inFire speed (2011) the Omnicam (2012), the caries control system SIROInspect (2012) and the Astra Tech Implant System (2013), the Class Solution (2013), the five-axis milling and grinding unit inLab X5 (2014), the Cavitron Touch with Steri-Mate 360 Ultrasonic Scaling System (2015) and the soft tissue laser SIROLaser Blue (2015).
New innovations are, amongst others, Sphere(2015), the novel spherical filler technology resulting in a new global composite generation, Zirconia (2016), Celtra Press (2016), the 3Endo Software (2016), the Class Solution (2017), Nupro Freedom Cordless Prophy System (2017), OsseoSpeed Profile implant (2017), the Ovation polysapphire clear brackets (2018), Azento (Single Tooth Replacement) (2018), Acuris (2018) and SureSmiler Aligners (2018).

Quality Assurance
Sirona continues their commitment to users and patients with a comprehensive quality management program. This commitment extends to our suppliers and service providers.
Sirona meets or exceeds medical device regulations worldwide, with a partnership with notified bodies, certifying our compliance with medical device requirements. This results in both and medical device directive and 13485 Quality System for Medical Devices.
Country Regulatory bodies conducted regular inspections of our facilities to assure compliance to their regulations. This includes bodies such as the FDA, Health Canada, Saudi Arabia, Korea and more.
Environmental Leadership
At Sirona technical and ecological advances go hand in hand and represent an integral part of our corporate culture. We have a long history of supporting the communities in which we live, work and serve, and are dedicated to continually evolving and improving our efforts for corporate responsibility and sustainability.
Sirona remains committed to minimizing our environmental impact in every location where we conduct business.  We support and promote recycling, energy and natural resource conservation.  Our product development process involves rigorous testing and consideration for environment impact.  Using Sirona’s digital x-ray units not only reduces a patient’s exposure to radiation by up to 70%, but also eliminates the need to develop film using toxic chemicals in the dental office.   Moreover, our manufacturing plants are maintained with the environment in mind.   Several of our facilities across the and Europe have energy efficient infrared heaters, high efficiency chiller systems and closed loop water cooling systems to significantly reduce water and energy usage. Additionally, several of our facilities are obtaining energy from renewable sources, including wind and solar.  This provides a view into our cost efficiency and greenhouse gas emission opportunities.  All of these efforts - and more - are aimed at reducing materials consumption and waste, and reflect our commitment in making Sirona a responsible and environmentally conscious corporate organization.
As with the environment, we place great emphasis on safety in the workplace and have high standards when it comes to making sure all possible steps are taken in guaranteeing the health and safety of our employees.  Our goal is to protect the lives and health of our employees and surrounding communities. To achieve this goal, our employees receive safety training and we conduct annual Environmental, Health and Safety audits in our manufacturing facilities. We work with regulatory bodies to ensure compliance with all safety standards.

Quality management
For Sirona, as the dental technology leader, a functioning quality management program is essential to economic success.
Products and services of high technical quality and innovation set the standards in the market. Compliance with standards is required by our partners and customers. In order to fully meet these requirements, Sirona has implemented a process oriented quality management program, which focuses on our partners and customers.
The directive 93/42/dated June 14, 1993, which pertains to medical devices, serves as the framework of Sirona's quality management program. All member countries are subject to this directive and implementation is enforced by national laws in each country. The directive confronts all manufacturers and distributors of medical devices within the European Economic Area (+ EFTA) with the same requirements. Certification according to 13485 and according to Annex to the directive 93/42/provides proof of the highest quality, reliability and trustworthiness. Annual auditing by the TÜProduct Service technical inspection agency in Munich ensures continual improvement of our quality management system.
Sirona takes on the daily challenge of ensuring and constantly optimizing its high standards of quality. The Sirona quality management program provides employees with a well honed tool to meet the high demands of being a true leader in quality and innovation.
