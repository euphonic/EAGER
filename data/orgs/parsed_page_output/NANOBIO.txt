BlueWillow Biologics is a privately-held biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing intranasal vaccines and topical anti-infective products, based on its patented nanotechnology platform.
The company was originally founded as Corporation, a spin-off from the Center for Biologic Nanotechnology at the University of Michigan, and was initially focused on developing nano-scale dermatology applications.  Based on promising research generated under several Gates Foundation, and contracts, the company underwent a strategic “pivot” in 2017 to refocus its nanotechnology platform on the development of intranasal vaccines for infectious and allergic diseases, and topical anti-infective treatments for wounds.
BlueWillow’s lead product candidates include intranasal vaccines for , pertussis , anthrax , HSV-2 ,  chlamydia and peanut allergy . The company’s NanoVax™ technology platform utilizes a novel oil-in-water emulsion adjuvant to enable intranasal vaccines that elicit mucosal and systemic Th1/Th17 immunity. BlueWillow’s vaccines uniquely elicit mucosal antibodies that serve as “bouncers at the door” as the body’s first line of defense to keep infections out.
In addition to its vaccine programs, BlueWillow has continued to advance certain novel topical wound applications largely through partnerships under the company’s NanoBio™ division. BlueWillow’s headquarters and laboratory facilities are located in Ann Arbor, Michigan.
