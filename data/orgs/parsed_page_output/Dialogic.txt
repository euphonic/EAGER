and IBM’s shared vision for real-time communications has naturally led the two companies to develop technology that can be easily integrated with each other’s solutions. This continued partnership is demonstrated in the number of applications that have been developed over the years with each other’s technology. 
Solution Focus:
has established an integration point with the Watson suite of analytics tools in its PowerNova Application Server that can be accessed by both PowerVille real-time communications applications as well as customized applications built on the PowerNova platform.
This integration point accesses Watson’s and analytics tools via the Voice Gateway using standards based protocols to make interoperability with other solutions straightforward and easier. Read the blog Intersecting Real-Time Communications with Watson Artificial Intelligence for more details.
Websphere Liberty
debuted their Webcapabilities with Websphere Liberty at Interconnect 2016. WebSphere Liberty is a fast and easy-to-use application server, based on a mix of and open-source software.  When used with Dialogic’s PowerMedia XMS, WebSphere Liberty creates the foundation for multi-media enterprise Webapplications.
Cognitive Customer Experience Application based on PowerMedia XMS
was featured in IBM’s Cognitive Agent demonstrations titled “So You Want to Talk To Watson? Just Give It Call” at World of Watson 2016. The demonstration showed how financial service companies can leverage Watson's real-time voice interface to replace aging interactive voice response (IVR) systems with self-service cognitive agents, or provide live agents with real-time voice analytics to better service their customers. PowerMedia enables the demonstration by facilitating a live-agent Websession, providing an interface between the Websession and IBM’s Watson Speech-to-Text engine, performing conversion of voice codecs in real-time (also known as transcoding).  Read the press release for more detail.
This video shows the ease in integrating Watson’s Speech-to-text services in building a Webgateway using PowerMedia XMS.
