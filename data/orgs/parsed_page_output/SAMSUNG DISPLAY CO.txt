How do join?
Please access Samsung’s partner portal at 
 and register your account.  We look forward to speaking with you about our program!
What products are included in the for program?
for is focused entirely on the B2products sold by Electronics. This includes Smart Signage, Smart Hospitality displays, Smart signage, e-boards, and monitors. Please visit our website, displaysolutions.samsung.com, for more information on our product lineup.
By focusing our program on products, we are better able to meet your requirements and support you.
How is this different from the previous partner program?
In addition to being focused on display, for varies in a number of key areas:
						
- More targeted benefits and support
- Allows partners to gain Certifications to demonstrate to customers their expertise in a product
- Provides our partners access to a fully re-designed partner cloud containing new tools and resources
sell smart signage, hospitality, and monitor products. What kind of status can achieve?
It is possible for a single partner to be, for example, Platinum in Smart Signage, Gold in Hospitality and Silver in Monitor. However, in practice, very few partners sell all three categories of products, so we expect by far most partners to hold either one or two status designations.  
					

					The limited universe of partners that do sell significant quantities across all three specializations will be granted special marketing assets. Please contact your account manager for details.

Key Features
Optimum hardware control
Optimum hardware Control
Robust monitoring
Advanced features
Optimum hardware control
Samsung’s Remote Management Solution is equipped with a monitoring dashboard designed to allow for teams to view information such as screen activity and content. The dashboard also enables consumers to select displays or groups and review historical information. Also included is the ability to change settings such as power, volume and input source, plus push new firmware and automate software updates. 
Remote control
Control all on-screen menus as if you are in front of the display.
Device setting control
Ability to adjust critical hardware settings including power on/off, volume control, input source, picture mode and time, etc.
Quick control
Samsung’s Remote Management Solutions supports a responsive control panel for frequently used settings.
Web browser control
On the Tizen device, users can control web browser settings such as setting home pages, movement of URLs, zoom ratio and refresh intervals.
Security control
With this feature, users can monitor and control all security settings including network port access and navigation based on a company’s security policy.
Remote software update
This feature allows for managing firmware versions on the displays. Users can register or publish new firmware for their displays.
Robust monitoring
Previously, whenever a device experienced an error, there was no way to determine the root cause and a service call had to be scheduled. However, Samsung’s Remote Management Solution can detect over 40 hardware errors within a network. Using these codes, the cause of errors can be identified and solved without the need for a service call. Also, device statistics provide data on error rates, connection status and approval. No matter the location, users can be assured of access at all times.
Error detection
Enables detection and troubleshooting for over 40 hardware and 10 software errors and warning information to diagnose a problem within a device on a user’s network.
Error code guide
An error code from the server will be sent to a user detailing the issue and provide guidance on how to resolve the error remotely via Web Manual.
Mobile access
Users can connect to the server at any time, regardless of their location.
Device statistics
Support summary information on devices such as error occurrence, connection history and approval status.
Advanced features
Samsung’s Remote Management Solution is a fully customizable solution, offering various advanced features to emphasize the brand image and reduce operational burden. Users can now add their company logo or video file to the Remote Management tool to their own logos or taglines on the screen while turning on a device.
