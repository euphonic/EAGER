Overview
("ChipMOS") is one of the world’s largest semiconductor services companies, providing a full range of back-end testing services for liquid crystal display (LCD) drivers, high density memory, and mixed-signal semiconductors.  The Company is listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange (TWSE: 8150) and on the Stock Market (ticker “IMOS”).  In addition, we offer a comprehensive selection of leadframe-based and organic substrate-based package assembly services for memory, mixed-signal, and driver semiconductors, which are used in diverse end markets, including consumer electronics, personal computers, communications equipment, office automation and exciting new markets including drones, Virtual Reality and Assisted Reality.  We tailor our advanced testing and packaging services to meet the critical needs of our customers on a turnkey basis or by providing standalone testing and packaging services. 
With operations strategically headquartered in Taiwan, the heart of the world’s technology value chain, most testing is currently conducted at our facility in the Hsinchu Science Park, while semiconductor packaging services are primarily conducted at our Southern Taiwan Science Park facility.  We also provide gold bumping services at our dedicated facility in Chupei, Hsinchu. All of our facilities are state-of-the-art and reflect our long-standing commitment to supporting customers with the best technology and support services they need to excel.
In addition to our high value added back-end solutions, we work in collaboration with our global client base to provide a complete range of vertically integrated and advanced solutions ranging from package design through drop-shipment. This powerful total solution capability is sought after by customers given compressed product lifecycles and the need for streamlined, efficient supply chain partners. Close collaboration between our R&teams and customers ensures technology roadmaps are synchronized with production readiness of new test and package solutions for increasingly sophisticated semiconductor products.
Growing with our customers leverages and expands our deployment of advanced engineering skills and capabilities for ongoing cost reductions, such as software conversion programs and parallel testing for client testing operations.

Reliability and Failure Analysis
International and/or customer defined reliability tests are well designed into qualification system, such as new package, engineering or process change qualification and periodical production process monitor. All tests are conducted following required procedure and conditions as per and MIL-(Military Standard) standards. We provide in-time analysis as well to locate and identify source of failure while any non-conformance found from production or reliability tests. Meanwhile, we are (Taiwan Accreditation Foundation) qualified member in package reliability testing scope, reliability testing scope and chemical analysis scope.
