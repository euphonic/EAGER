Frequently Asked Questions.
What is a protection plan?
protection plan (also referred to as a service plan, extended service plan (ESP), extended service contract (ESC) or extended warranty) can provide you with product coverage above and beyond the terms and life of a manufacturer’s warranty. If your product fails, we are standing by ready to help you. Asurion Warranties protect against unexpected product failures and costly repairs or replacement and provide you with peace of mind. Asurion plans deliver fast, convenient repairs, simple plan management, 24/7 support, and online claims filing.
What is covered by an extended warranty?
typical protection plan covers repair of a product or the replacement of a product with a new or re-manufactured replacement product of like kind and quality or we may issue you a gift card or check for the original purchase price of that product, including taxes (if applicable), as indicated on your sales receipt. While specific protection plan benefits vary by the type of product they cover, some of the most common benefits include the following: – Parts and labor coverage for breakdowns caused by:
Normal wear and tear
Mechanical and electrical breakdowns
When can purchase a protection plan?
You can buy a protection plan any time within the first 30 days of the original product purchase.
How do file a claim for a failed product?
To get started,
click here  to register your product
click the logo of the retailer
click the “Start my claim” button.
After you’ve registered the product, you can upload store receipts, file or track a claim online, and get product support all within your personal solution hub.
How does an Asurion protection plan differ from a manufacturers warranty?
Unlike a manufacturer’s warranty, which is included with the purchase price of a product, protection plans are sold at a separate price. Manufacturer’s warranties are limited in the types of breakdowns they cover, as well as in their duration. In fact, some manufacturer’s warranties are as short as 90 days. Protection plans typically pick up once a manufacturer’s warranty expires, but some plans also offer benefits during the manufacturer’s warranty period, as well. And for portable electronics, such as tablets and laptops, many protection plans include coverage for Accidental Damage from Handling (ADH), such as drops, spills and cracked screens, which occur during the normal use of the product beginning on the date of purchase. That’s protection that manufacturers don’t offer! Here is a breakdown of the basic differences between reputable protection plans and manufacturers’ warranties:
Benefits
1-5 years for parts + labor: no split
Length of coverage, labor
90 days to 2 yrs; may differ from parts (split)
2-5 years for labor +parts; no split
Customer service
Limited Business hours Mon-Fri 8 am to 5 pm Closed Sat + Sun
24/7 online support and assistance over the phone during extended hours (sometimes 24/7)
