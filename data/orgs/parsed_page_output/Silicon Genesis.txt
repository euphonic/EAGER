1997 R&CAMPBELL, SOLUTIONS
Soon thereafter, SiGen developed and demonstrated a core set of leading-edge processes for Silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer fabrication
 using
 innovations such as plasma activated bonding and room temperature cleaving. The company completed a pilot production facility in 2000 to demonstrate its technology capabilities. After successfully introducing its technology and completing its first major commercial license in 2004, SiGen made the transition to begin a fabless licensor and equipment provider for its engineered substrate solutions covering the 200mm/300mm market. 
      
As an outgrowth of SiGen's bonded layer transfer technology for the semiconductor, opto-electronic and display markets, the company developed a next-generation layer transfer (LT) technology called PolyMax™. With numerous emerging opportunities, SiGen broadened its market application into the Solar Cell Market.
The PolyMax™ technology addresses multiple issues of the current wafering process and market conditions: namely the cost aspects of wafering and the technical barriers to wafer thickness reduction. In addition, SiGen's PolyMax™ is a "green" process since there is no sawing, grinding or other mechanical thinning of wafers
