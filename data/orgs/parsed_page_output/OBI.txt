Winter Alert: Predicted Winter Weather to Impact Blood Supply
December 6, 2018 – Winter weather, including ice and snow, is in the forecast for the weekend, and Oklahoma Blood Institute is strongly urging donors to make blood donation part of their winter preparedness plan.

Healthy adults, age sixteen and up, are encouraged to give blood at one of Oklahoma Blood Institute’s convenient donor centers or mobile blood drives while running errands before winter weather moves into the area.  Blood donation typically takes only about an hour and one donation saves up to three lives.

Wins Bedlam Blood Battle
Both Schools Help Thousands Who Rely on Generous Blood Donors
November 9, 2018 – The University of Oklahoma Sooners claim victory in this fall’s Bedlam Blood Battle, bringing in more blood donors than the Oklahoma State Cowboys on the eve of the Bedlam football game.  979 people participated in the five-day Bedlam Blood Battle this week on OU’s campus in Norman, and another 831 participated on the campus in Stillwater, for a total of 1,810 participants.
The Sooners will keep the trophy in Norman for the second year in a row.  The trophy will be presented to leaders at a future date still to be determined, and the school will carry bragging rights until next fall.
“We congratulate the Sooners on their victory in this annual friendly competition, but both the Sooners and the Cowboys should be very proud of what they did to save the lives of Oklahoma patients,” said John Armitage, M.D., President and of Oklahoma Blood Institute. “The Bedlam Blood Battle is an opportunity to show school spirit in the week before the game.  And, it’s an even better way to help people in our local hospitals who are battling cancer, trauma, and other serious conditions.”
Oklahoma Blood Institute deeply appreciates the committed community partnership of the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University.
The Bedlam Blood Battle highlighted the need for blood donation as we head into the Thanksgiving holidays, when fewer people typically give.  Because each blood donation saves up to three lives, the Bedlam Blood Battle will help save more than 4,000 lives.
Generous donors received Bedlam-themed t-shirts and chances to win prizes.

Oklahoma Blood Institute Pioneers First-of-its-Kind Donor Recognition Program
Governor proclaims Aug. 2 as Thank-The-Donor™ Day
CITY, Aug. 2, 2018 – Whether given or received, words of gratitude can be powerful.
To harness the power of a simple “thank you,” Oklahoma Blood Institute has pioneered Thank-The-Donor™, the nation’s first web-enabled technology that connects blood recipients with their donors while complying with medical privacy laws.
With this patent-pending technology, patients can send a note, photo or video to their donor using a smartphone, tablet or computer. The groundbreaking program breaks communication barriers with a new and different way to share a “thank you” while protecting the anonymity of both donor and patient.  green, heart-shaped tag is affixed to every blood bag from Oklahoma Blood Institute, encouraging recipients or their families to visit ThankTheDonor.org .
In recognition of this innovative program, Gov. Mary Fallin has proclaimed August 2, 2018, as Thank-The-Donor™ Day in Oklahoma.
“Few patients who receive donated blood ever know or have the opportunity to offer their gratitude with their blood donors,” Gov. Fallin’s proclamation reads.  “Thank-The-Donor™ …conveniently facilitates uplifting connectedness between a blood donor and recipient.”
“Every three minutes in Oklahoma an ill or injured patient requires a blood transfusion,” said John Armitage, M.D., president & of Oklahoma Blood Institute. “Every drop of blood we provide comes from volunteer donations. Thousands of selfless Oklahomans give this gift of life every year. While they don’t do it for the recognition, we hope this program will help show our donors just how special their donation is for the patient who receives it.”
Patients who receive blood products like red cells, plasma and platelets can use the Thank-The-Donor™ technology to express their appreciation to their donor.  Ben Evans of Ponca City needed blood from more than 40 donors during a life-threatening health crisis that left him hospitalized for 60 days.  He takes every opportunity he can to thank Oklahoma Blood Institute donors for their priceless gift.
“Without those blood products, wouldn’t have made it.  42 units of blood means a lot of people took an hour out of their day to help a complete stranger,” said Evans.  “have had the opportunity to give blood twice sreceiving it as my way of paying back those that gave me the chance at life—by ‘Paying it Forward’.”
Oklahoma Blood Institute is the sixth largest nonprofit blood collector in the United States, serving more than 160 hospitals and medical facilities in Oklahoma.

Global Blood Fund Marks 10th Anniversary
World Blood Donor Day is proclaimed on June 14 by the World Health Organization and World Blood Donor Day is recognized by hundreds of blood centers around the world, including Oklahoma Blood Institute, OBI.
“We encourage everyone to acknowledge World Blood Donor Day with the selfless act of blood donation,” said John Armitage, M.D., Oklahoma Blood Institute president and  “We seldom take time to think about the life-saving difference a secure blood supply makes.  Countries around the world and even other states in our nation are not as fortunate as we are to have loyal blood donors.”
Of those eligible to donate blood, less than 10 percent give annually. Yet, people who are healthy and 16 years or older*, can typically donate. Blood can be given every 56 days. Oklahoma Blood Institute provides every drop of blood needed by patients in more than 160 medical facilities across the state.
Schedule your life-saving blood donation today at a donor center or mobile drive near you. 
This year’s World Blood Donor Day is especially important because it marks the tenth anniversary of Global Blood Fund.
Any donor can forgo the T-shirt offered in appreciation for giving.  In turn, Oklahoma Blood Institute, OBI, will make a monetary donation of similar value to Global Blood Fund , a 501(c)(3) charity organization that procures blood center supplies to developing countries to maintain a safe blood supply. It’s a chance to ‘doubly give’ to those who need the life-saving gift of blood worldwide. Donors may also text “BLOOD” to 52000 to text $5 to Global Blood Fund.
“Global Blood Fund is dedicated to fighting the world transfusion crisis,” said Dr. Armitage.  “pledges to keep securing the resources necessary to save the lives of thousands of women who suffer hemorrhaging during childbirth and young children under age five who may otherwise succumb to malaria, injuries, and other afflictions.”
Most recently, Global Blood Fund has donated remodeled bloodmobiles to Sri Lanka, Mexico, and several countries in Africa, so that donors who have never had access before can give blood.  Blood bags and other center supplies were distributed in several countries across Africa.
* To give blood, 16 year olds must weigh at least 125 and provide signed parental permission, 17 year olds must weigh at least 125 pounds, 18+ year olds must weigh at least 110 pounds.

76 Members of Football Family Register for Be The Match
The football team held a registration drive with Be The Match on Thursday, March 29, in the team’s Switzer Center meeting room.  remarkable 76 members of the football family, including coach Riley, players, and staff members, registered for Be The Match during the drive, by doing a simple cheek swab.
Coach Riley introduced guest speakers, including Jayson Asher, whose daughter Mackenzie captured the hearts of Heisman trophy winner Baker Mayfield and the Sooners as she fought leukemia.  Mackenzie passed away in December of last year at age 11, and Mayfield dedicated the rest of the season to courageous Mackenzie.
Cameron Dukes, father of 11-year-old Kamryn Dukes, spoke about his daughter’s battle with Sickle Cell disease, and the level of commitment needed to join the registry.  Kamryn is now cured of Sickle Cell, following a marrow transplant.  Her father, only a partial match, donated his marrow after several potential matches declined.
“remember walking past people wondering if they were the person who could save my daughter’s life,” said Dukes.  “What you have in you could actually save someone’s life.”
Chris Watson, an athletic trainer, talked to the team about his nephew’s brave fight against a rare blood disorder.  Bennett Hanneman died in 2015 at just three years old, about six months after a stem cell transplant.
“That’s 182 days we wouldn’t have had Bennett without Be The Match,” said Watson.  “I’d do anything for a 183rd.”
For thousands diagnosed with leukemia or other blood diseases, the best and only hope for a cure is a tissue-matched donor to provide a blood stem cell or marrow transplant.  For 70 percent of patients, that cure can only be found through an unrelated donor. 
“If you get the call, you’ve won the lottery,” said Asher.  “You get the gift to save somebody’s life.”
“just think if it was my brother, I’d want someone to help him,” said running back Rodney Anderson, who was inspired to join the Be The Match registry Thursday.
Be The Match, an affiliate of Oklahoma Blood Institute, matches patients with unrelated donors, through a cheek swab and brief registration process.  Be The Match registrants must be ages 18-44, healthy, and willing to donate to any matched patient.  Those wishing to register for Be The Match may also do so online.
As the nation’s 9th largest non-profit blood center, Oklahoma Blood Institute serves more than 160 hospitals and medical facilities statewide.  Oklahoma Blood Institute facilitates stem cell donations at its location in Oklahoma City.Give Blood

ESSENTIAL
It is critical that O-negative donors donate regularly sonly 9% of the population has this blood type, and can only receive this same blood type.
Having O-negative blood available is vital because it can be used by any person in the more than 160 medical facilities we serve who may be in urgent need but whose blood type hasn’t yet been identified.
Imagine if a family member, friend or co-worker was in urgent need of blood. Donating every 56 days, and encouraging others with O-negative blood type to do the same, ensures your loved ones would receive the life-saving blood when they need it.

Both Schools Help Thousands Who Rely on Generous Blood Donors
November 9, 2018 – The University of Oklahoma Sooners claim victory in this fall’s Bedlam Blood Battle, bringing in more blood donors than the Oklahoma State Cowboys on the eve of the Bedlam football game.  979 people participated in the five-day Bedlam Blood Battle this week on OU’s campus in Norman, and another 831 participated on the campus in Stillwater, for a total of 1,810 participants.
The Sooners will keep the trophy in Norman for the second year in a row.  The trophy will be presented to leaders at a future date still to be determined, and the school will carry bragging rights until next fall.
“We congratulate the Sooners on their victory in this annual friendly competition, but both the Sooners and the Cowboys should be very proud of what they did to save the lives of Oklahoma patients,” said John Armitage, M.D., President and of Oklahoma Blood Institute. “The Bedlam Blood Battle is an opportunity to show school spirit in the week before the game.  And, it’s an even better way to help people in our local hospitals who are battling cancer, trauma, and other serious conditions.”
Oklahoma Blood Institute deeply appreciates the committed community partnership of the University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University.
The Bedlam Blood Battle highlighted the need for blood donation as we head into the Thanksgiving holidays, when fewer people typically give.  Because each blood donation saves up to three lives, the Bedlam Blood Battle will help save more than 4,000 lives.
Generous donors received Bedlam-themed t-shirts and chances to win prizes.
