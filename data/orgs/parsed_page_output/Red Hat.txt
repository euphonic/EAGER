Our company
We revolutionized the operating system with Hat® Enterprise Linux® . Now, we have a broad portfolio , including hybrid cloud infrastructure, middleware, agile integration, cloud-native application development, and management and automation solutions. With technologies, companies can successfully adapt as business becomes more digital and interconnected.
We are Hat. We've been here for more than 25 years, and we're here to help you face your business challenges head-on.
trusted leader in innovation
Linux
initially saw success with a custom distribution of Linux, then called "Linux." The reliability and growth of and Linux have made the 2 synonymous to many. Since those early days, we've built on this foundation to support nearly all levels of the stack and support Linux across the hybrid cloud.
Containers
is the second-largest contributor to the upstream Kubernetes project and the originator of many of its key features, components, and related container technologies. We have years of experience running Kubernetes in the cloud and supporting organizations using containers in production. Today, we're working with the cloud-native community to push the boundaries of wcontainers and Kubernetes can do, from serverless computing to machine learning.
Hat's dedication to, support of, and decades of involvement in open source communities lets us contribute useful technology, refine and harden it, and prepare it for the enterprise. This engagement comes with a promise : Keep these technologies open so everyone can help create, promote, and maintain better open source software and discourage patent aggression.
We believe in the power of open hybrid cloud. Standalone cloud deployments based on proprietary technology aren't the answer because they inhibit clouds from interacting with one another. Open hybrid cloud brings the interoperability, workload portability, and flexibility of open source to hybrid environments, bridging them together and creating a unified experience.
An open source development model
Hat's development model begins in open source communities and results in stable, enterprise-ready solutions.
Freedom and choice with subscriptions
If you're looking for a traditional licensing model and the resulting added costs and vendor lock-in, you're in the wrong place. Our subscription model gives customers access to the latest technology, enterprise-grade assurance, and open source expertise from our leading engineers.
In other words, subscriptions give you the freedom to move your business forward with less worry and more room for innovation.
Only as strong as our people
Hatters are passionate, curious, and accomplished. We come from different professional backgrounds and hone our skills to create reliable products and experiences for our customers. We're all over the globe but united in the belief tworking in an open way has the power to change the world for the better.
Our leadership
The most respected and influential people at are those who show passion for our mission and live it every day. leader at does not rely on their title to earn respect.
Jim Whitehurst, President and chief executive officer, From the leaders in open source, for the leaders in IT
Our open source solutions run through the stacks of the world's most demanding datacenters and clouds.

Our development model
How the best ideas become enterprise‑ready
Innovation doesn't happen by chance. It's the outcome of a proven process. The                     Hat® development                     model begins in the open source community, with thousands of contributors, and results in finished                     products tare tried, tested, and trusted.
We build open source solutions for the enterprise
An open development model connects engineers to open source communities . Members of                             these communities work together to identify and elevate the best ideas. supports                             these communities by contributing to the code, and by creating products from upstream                             projects.
We’re involved in many open source communities, building and refining the technologies t                            make up today’s environments. From the operating system to storage, to middleware, and                             containers—all the way up to management and automation—is building open                             source                             solutions with certifications and services for the enterprise.
Community spotlight
closer look at the development of Ansible Engine
Ansible is the upstream community of the product teventually becomes Ansible Engine —agentless enterprise—grade automation software. The community was founded in                         2012 and made                         the 2017 GitHub Octoverse report in the categories                         of most reviewed, most discussed, and most                         contributors.
Every day, community members work on new modules, update existing modules, and contribute to the                         basic and core code tmake modules possible. The turnaround time on Ansible Engine is fast,                         with a new release every 1—3 months. Thanks to the dedication of the upstream community,                         and                         Hat’s enterprise—level experience, Ansible Engine has become a powerful way for customers                         to                         build and write playbooks.
Security
More eyes. More secure.
The community—to—enterprise development model often results in more                                     secure software                                     compato proprietary software for 3 core reasons. First: When everyone can see                                     the code, more threats can be discovered. Next: Issues tarise get patched                                     quickly because the source code is accessible. Finally: takes responsibility                                     for testing, hardening, and supporting open source software, so every customer                                     shares the same level of assurance.
Obvious—and less obvious—savings
Open source software doesn’t require a licensing fee—which results in a clear                                     advantage when examining the cost to deploy a solution. However, massive development savings are also represented in a community—based distribution. One estimate                                     shows                                     twhen you account for inflation at the time, it would cost approximately US$10.8                                     billion to build the Fedora 9 distribution from scratch.(*) The                                     contributors who                                     work on Linux® projects share this development burden over time.
Patents for defensive purposes only
Open source communities are free to innovate without the barriers of patents. We                                     believe tsoftware patents impede innovation in software development and                                     discourage open source innovation. For this reason, we issued our first patent                                     promise in 2002 to discourage patent aggression—and in 2017, we expanded this                                     promise.
Christophe Defayet, Director of Software                                     Development, Security, and Communication Systems, Amadeus
Longevity
Your code is here to stay
With proprietary solutions, there's always a risk tthe company could discontinue                                     the code. With open source software, however, there's no risk of discontinuation.                                     Even if the vendor stops distributing a certain product, the code will                                     remain available for use and improvement.

trusted leader in innovation
Linux
initially saw success with a custom distribution of Linux, then called "Linux." The reliability and growth of and Linux have made the 2 synonymous to many. Since those early days, we've built on this foundation to support nearly all levels of the stack and support Linux across the hybrid cloud.
Containers
is the second-largest contributor to the upstream Kubernetes project and the originator of many of its key features, components, and related container technologies. We have years of experience running Kubernetes in the cloud and supporting organizations using containers in production. Today, we're working with the cloud-native community to push the boundaries of wcontainers and Kubernetes can do, from serverless computing to machine learning.
Hat's dedication to, support of, and decades of involvement in open source communities lets us contribute useful technology, refine and harden it, and prepare it for the enterprise. This engagement comes with a promise : Keep these technologies open so everyone can help create, promote, and maintain better open source software and discourage patent aggression.
We believe in the power of open hybrid cloud. Standalone cloud deployments based on proprietary technology aren't the answer because they inhibit clouds from interacting with one another. Open hybrid cloud brings the interoperability, workload portability, and flexibility of open source to hybrid environments, bridging them together and creating a unified experience.
An open source development model
Hat's development model begins in open source communities and results in stable, enterprise-ready solutions.
Freedom and choice with subscriptions

Open Source
When the best ideas win, you can't lose
Every solution starts with sharing a problem. Technology thrives in the open, where people are free to share their ideas and build on the work of others.
Creation is always an act of collaboration.
The open source way
Connected curiosity
At Hat, when we talk about " open source ," we're talking about a proven way of collaborating to create technology. The freedom to see the code, to learn from it, to ask questions and offer improvements: This is the open source way.
When the best ideas win, customers can't lose.

Collaborating with for social good
See how Open Innovation Labs brought multiple teams together to apply technology to the world’s most pressing problems facing children
Human problems. Open solutions.
Imagine whappens when someone creates something and, rather than keeping it to themselves, says to the world: “Take this. Build on it. Make it better.”
lot of incredible things take place. People come together. Ideas get stronger. Progress happens faster. And then there’s all the drama, humor, frustration, accomplishment, and joy thappen along the way.
That’s wOpen Source Stories is all about.
Community builder
Open source communities can innovate far more effectively than traditional R&labs. So we bring customers, partners, and developers into communities of purpose to solve shaproblems together.
Contributor
also contributes a lot of code. We pay our engineers and developers to work in open technology communities on behalf of our customers, contributing work to the project like everyone else.
Curator
When useful open source technology emerges, we test it, harden it, and make it secure and reliable. Then we gather, package, and support it as enterprise products.
More eyes. More secure.
While it might seem counterintuitive, open source software is often more secure than proprietary software. In fact, debugging and securing software is part of the essence and common purpose of software communities.
More eyes. Fewer bugs. Sunlight really is the best disinfectant.
Vice President of Product Management, Technologies
There’s a community behind every open source technology
contributes to communities tare changing the landscape of technology—from the operating system and developer toolchain to middleware, the desktop, and the cloud. See the full list of communities we support.

Platform management options
Management for virtual and private cloud infrastructure
The majority of enterprises can't afford to dedicate 100% of their business to a single environment. Today's infrastructure is spread out across physical hardware, heterogeneous virtual environments, and private clouds—and tcan be hard to manage. CloudForms makes management easy. It works in all those environments across your platforms and integrates with many of the providers you already use.
CloudForms for virtual platforms
Virtualization's widespread applicability has helped reduce vendor lock-in, allowing companies to update their environments with less-expensive commodity servers, operating systems, and applications from a variety of vendors. CloudForms can help organizations continue to avoid vendor lock-in by migrating virtual machines (VMs) to lower cost virtual infrastructure platforms and operating them across multiple hypervisors—such as 
Virtualization
, 
Kernel-based Virtual Machine
, and VMware.
Using CloudForms to manage virtual platforms, you can:
Implement self-service ordering with complete life-cycle management.
See and control security, performance, and capacity for all VMs.
Maintain compliance with corporate, industry, and government requirements.

CloudForms for private clouds
CloudForms brings the interoperability, workload portability, and flexibility of open source to private cloud environments. It’s engineeto work with 
OpenStack
®
 Platform
 and includes management and automation capabilities taren’t available in the OpenStack project. Additionally, CloudForms can help you operate your private cloud more safely by implementing governance and enforcing compliance.
Using CloudForms to manage Private clouds, you can:
Manage, approve, automatically provision, customize, secure, and retire cloud instances.
Track private cloud operations, such as performance, capacity, use, and compliance.
Track private cloud resource life cycles and use.
Identify idle resources.
Bring existing deployments under management without changing the process.

CloudForms for physical infrastructure
For all the applicability and scalability Stuff-as-a-Service provides, it hasn't replaced the need for physical servers. CloudForms is compatible with Lenovo XClarity—an integration tgives system administrators valuable insight into on-premise capacity and its impact on other resources within your hybrid infrastructure.
Using CloudForms to manage physical infrastructure, you can:
Discover and manage physical compute infrastructure alongside virtual and multicloud resources in a single display.

Management for virtual and private cloud infrastructure
The majority of enterprises can't afford to dedicate 100% of their business to a single environment. Today's infrastructure is spread out across physical hardware, heterogeneous virtual environments, and private clouds—and tcan be hard to manage. CloudForms makes management easy. It works in all those environments across your platforms and integrates with many of the providers you already use.
CloudForms for virtual platforms
Virtualization's widespread applicability has helped reduce vendor lock-in, allowing companies to update their environments with less-expensive commodity servers, operating systems, and applications from a variety of vendors. CloudForms can help organizations continue to avoid vendor lock-in by migrating virtual machines (VMs) to lower cost virtual infrastructure platforms and operating them across multiple hypervisors—such as 
Virtualization
, 
Kernel-based Virtual Machine
, and VMware.
Using CloudForms to manage virtual platforms, you can:
Implement self-service ordering with complete life-cycle management.
See and control security, performance, and capacity for all VMs.
Maintain compliance with corporate, industry, and government requirements.
