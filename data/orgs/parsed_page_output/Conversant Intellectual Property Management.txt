“Inc.” is the new name of Technologies Incorporated.
“Inc.” is the new name of Technologies Incorporated.History
Conversant’s story begins in Ottawa in 1975, when engineers Richard Foss and Robert Harland founded MOSAID, a semiconductor technology company. In the early days, we focused on inventing ways to improve Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) semiconductor chips, the primary form of computer memory. Our engineers also designed and built test equipment for debugging prototype memory chips.
By the mid-1990s, we found that our patented memory inventions were being used in mainstream chips without our consent; as a result, our first patent licensing program was born. Over the years, we successfully licensed virtually the entire commodity industry to our memory patents—proving the value and importance of these inventions.
We’re proud of our history as inventors, and indeed, we continue to invent, patent and license our own technology. In 2007, we expanded our focus and began to acquire patents and enter partnerships and revenue-sharing arrangements with other patent owners. The following year, we introduced HyperLink (HLNAND™), a breakthrough Flash Memory technology.
In 2013, we became Conversant: a new name for an experienced company with expertise, a determination to engage in meaningful negotiation and a commitment to transparency and the principled enforcement of high-quality patents. Today, we are a leading company with world-class licensing teams and an enviable record of success.

Working to shape the future of our industry
We’re committed to developing and encouraging responsible patent licensing principles. It’s important to debate the issues to stop the unfair practices that taint our industry. It’s why we actively participate in policy debates with the legislative and regulatory bodies that govern our industry. We’re concerned because we want patent licensing to continue as it was originally intended—to create value for inventors.
In our view
Respectful two-way dialogue and responsible negotiations will result in a fair and reasonable agreement for both parties. licensor should offer only quality patents to an appropriate licensee, and only after due diligence.
Litigation is not the starting point; it should be an option in the case of unsuccessful negotiations. Irresponsible litigation should result in negative consequences for the actor.

“Inc.” is the new name of Technologies Incorporated.Discover the true value of partnership
At Conversant, increasing the value of patented is all we do. That’s why global owners – including Nokia, Microsoft, Micron Technology and other well-known semiconductor memory companies – have turned to us to maximize their portfolio values.
Why do companies choose Conversant?  Because of our track record and our people. And because of our principled approach to licensing, and our culture of respect and fairness.
We do more than offer customized, comprehensive licensing programs that take into account the goals and constraints of the owner. We seek to be a true partner to companies relying on us to manage their valuable assets. Our integrity and experience foster a level of trust rarely found in the licensing sector.
We’ve earned our reputation through the way we conduct our patent analysis, prosecution, acquisition, licensing and assertion activities. We excel at uncovering the hidden gems in portfolios and producing clear, detailed documentation showing infringement to potential licensees. And, as our potential licensees will attest, we approach our negotiations with a view to an open and fair discussion.
Our partners benefit from our long years of experience, and depend on our strategic patenting capabilities to realize the full potential of a portfolio. Our first objective is to enter into licensing agreements through respectful negotiations. But when needed, we’re skilled in the strategic and operational aspects of litigation management. Our success record is impeccable as we strive to ensure maximum returns to our stakeholders.
