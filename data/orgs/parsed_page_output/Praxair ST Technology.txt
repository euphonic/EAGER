Environmental engagement is a huge part of making our planet more productive. At Praxair, our employees participate in a number of programs from Zero Waste to Earth Week initiativehelp create a more sustainable future. Explore some of our employee environmental engagement highlights.
Praxair's Greenway Project
We're matching employee Zero Waste contributions with global tree planting and partnering with global non-government organizations, local groups, customers and supplierplant or preserve one million trees by the end of 2016 and 2020.
Through employee environmental engagement initiatives like Praxair's Greenway project and our Zero Waste and office greening programs, our employees are helping to create a more sustainable future.
PRAXAIR'PROJECT: MILLION+ 2020
The essence of Praxair's Greenway project is matching employee zero waste contributionglobal tree planting.  has already helped plant or preserve more than 1,000,000 trees by the end of 2016, from a 2013 baseline.  And, that figure will grow in the coming years: has also committed to planting or preserving one million trees from 2016-2020.  (See video at left for more information.)
is working with organizations such as the  Arbor Day Foundation  and  The Nature Conservancy  on this important project. 
PRAXAIR'PROGRAM
In 2017, a record 263 locations achieved zero waste status – exceeding our goal of 225 sites. The combined efforts of these sites around the world helped prevent more than 125 million pounds of waste going to landfill.  Zero Waste is defined as one that keeps at least 90% of its process waste from going to landfills. In addition, four offices have earned third-party accreditation to Green Seal's Green Office Partner Program .
Eliminating waste has resulted in thousands of dollars of cost avoidance for Praxair, has conserved tons of material for reclamation and recycling and has supported people, jobs and the environment in scores of our local communities.

Doing more with less
We believe that issues over long-term energy availability and future climate change will only continue to intensify. Addressing the issues surrounding climate change is one of the highest priorities for around the world.
Disclosing Risks & Opportunities
member of the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index since 2006, we respond to the Carbon Disclosure Project request for information every year and publish our response. We have also been appointed to the Advisory Committee of the Climate Disclosure Standards Board — working to advance disclosure related to climate change in annual reports through the development of a global framework that will elicit comprehensive, consistent and comparable information. For more information, visit our 
Reporting Center
.
See our current response, provided each year in our 
Sustainable Development Reporting Center

Targets & Performance
has several energy efficiency and greenhouse gas targets that are helping us manage our carbon footprint. These targets cover the major contributorour greenhouse gas emissions: air separation units, hydrogen plants, and transport. We also set targethelp our customers reduce their footprint. Learn more about our 
Targets and Performance
 or visit our

Investing in Efficiency
At Praxair, we believe it’s important to invest our time and energy in improving our sustainable development, not just maintaining it. So, we conducted a study to compare the of our investments in improving the energy use of our existing plants against a range of alternatives for sourcing renewable energy. We found that our energy efficiency program is 10 times that of typical solar projects and more than twice that of wind alternatives— ensuring that energy efficiency is the best investment we can make right now to reduce our global energy footprint and natural resource consumption.

It is our goal to continue to provide environmental and energy savingour customers and our planet. That’s why we build technologies that improve the energy efficiency of industrial processes from metal production to refining. We are a major industrial gas supplier to the polysilicon market, serving more than 50 photovoltaic manufacturing facilities worldwide. And our industrial gases are crucial in the production of second-generation biofuels. Read the white paper below and learn more about our from energy efficiency.

Offsetting Climate Change
Climate change issues are increasing the demand for technologies that produce cleaner fuels and increase energy efficiency. And our programs like 
Less Carbon More Green
 are doing just that — helping our customers increase energy availability and improve energy efficiency while reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. Learn more about our Eco Portfolio on our

Keeping our people safe
Keeping our employees safe is not just about identifying the important contributing factoraccidents and implementing practiceminimize risks. It’s about ensuring that each employee conducts their work in a way that reflects the following safety principles:
Accidents and injuries are preventable
Safety is a line management accountability
Employees are responsible for their own safety
Employees are obligated to stop a job or refuse to perform a job if it is not safe or cannot be performed safely
Efforts in safety yield results
Safety is a condition of employment at Worldwide Personnel Safety
