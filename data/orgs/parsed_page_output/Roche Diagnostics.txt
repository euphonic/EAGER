                  This year, the focus of World Diabetes Day is all about family and diabetes, and we are celebrating by taking a close look at how families support each other in managing health. Can diabetes actually help families make health a priority? We think so—especially when families understand the demands of diabetes, and as a result their own individual health needs.

When it comes to managing diabetes, it is all about blood sugar. If blood sugar (or “blood glucose”) levels get too high or too low, it can drastically alter your mood, your well-being, and even your long-term health. But as important as blood sugar management is, for...

Since 1988, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) has updated its Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes, pulling new learning into its guidance for healthcare providers.

The biggest news this year is addressing the social and emotional aspects of successful diabetes management, going so far as to say "Lifestyle management and psychosocial care are the cornerstones of diabetes management." Of course, anyone with diabetes knows that the physical challenges are just one part of the story.

Improper disposal of lancets, insulin syringes, infusion set cannuals and other medical sharps can cause needlestick injuries, especially for garbage collectors. Please throw your used sharps away safely.
Keep in mind that anything sharp should not be simply thrown in your household trash. Depending upon your state, the requirements may vary. Some ask that you place sharps in a rigid container, such as a laundry bottle, then duct tape it closed and clearly write "do not recycle" on the outside.1 Other areas recommend collection or mail-back programs for these items.
