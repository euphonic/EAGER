Who We Are
The Power of Possibilities
With a legacy that spans more than 75 years, Momentive’s people have played two key roles for our customers. First, we are inventors of specialty materials, based on silicone, quartz and ceramics science, used in the products you touch every day. Second, we are collaborators, working with our customers to help their
    products better meet your desires.   
Cosmetics apply more smoothly, headlights stay clearer longer, running shoes are lighter and light bulbs last longer.  All because a product is in the mix.
Deep-rooted Ingenuity
Momentive’s tradition of innovative excellence began in May 1940, when research chemist Eugene Rochow discovered the direct reaction process for making silicone. Thus began a journey of scientific innovation, through which brands now improve products that touch almost every aspect of 
    
daily life
.   
Through our rich history, we have grown to become a top supplier of specialty silicones and materials. From the soles of the boots that first walked on the moon to tires that more tightly hug the roads here on earth, we deliver real results.   
core values
 reflect the corporate culture we pursue, a culture that enables us to engage in new challenges and meet customer needs. 
encourages comradery among our team members, collaboration with our partners and customers, and a commitment to delivering on promised results. By employing our 
    
core competencies
, we tenaciously pursue each goal we establish. This set of competencies guides our endeavors, and serves to measure our progress.
Far-reaching Innovations
silicone and our quartz/ceramics
 businesses are benefiting enterprises as dissimilar as agriculture and electrical transmission; textiles and tires; carpeting and healthcare.
Industries
 page, and you will begin to see how products permeate vast corners of the global industrial complex, and help improve both quality and efficiency throughout.
