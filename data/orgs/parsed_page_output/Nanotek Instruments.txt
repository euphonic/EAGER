About Us
Vision and Mission
Nanotek’s vision is to become an international leader in the research, development, and commercialization of low-cost nano materials, particularly for energy storage and conversion applications.
Nanotek’s mission is to:
produce highest-performing NGP-enhanced or NGP-enabled products that offer a competitive advantage and generate higher profit margins for our customers;
lead industries in establishing new market sectors for nano materials; and
continue to lead the efforts in advancing the field of nano graphene science and technology through cutting-edge research and development.
is headquartered in Dayton, Ohio. Established in 1997, has been one of the companies on the forefront of the nanotechnology revolution. The company was founded by Dr. Bor Jang, a leading expert in the research and development of low-cost carbon nanomaterials, batteries, supercapacitors, and fuel cells with over 170 patents issued or pending. Along with Dr. Jang, has assembled a truly skilled workforce of engineers, chemists, and material scientists with the aim of bringing nanotechnology into everyday life.
In 2007, spun off a company, Angstron Materials, Inc., to develop and manufacture a cost-effective, high-performance, nano-scale material called nano graphene platelets. Angstron has been manufacturing large quantities of both oxidized and pristine graphene since late 2007 and is currently the world’s largest producer of nano graphene platelets (NGPs).
