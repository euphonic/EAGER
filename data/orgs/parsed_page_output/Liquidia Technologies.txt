Technologies’ mission is to transform patients’ lives with precise drug particles.
Healthcare organizations of all types and sizes are experiencing unprecedented market pressure to deliver better results at reduced costs. is actively tackling some of those challenges.
Liquidia’s method for precisely engineering drug particles to new specification can enhance the therapeutic potential of the molecule for the patient, while minimizing risk and reducing time to market. PRINT® technology gives the pharmaceutical industry the power to produce precise drug particles, clinically-effective products at scale, and in some cases reduce manufacturing complexity and cost.
Technology
Liquidia’s proprietary technology brings the pharmaceutical industry the ability to design drug particles uniformly and in a wide variety of compositions, size and shapes. This novel process can optimize the performance of existing or new therapeutics, whether they are based on small molecules, peptides or biologics. The end result? Medications can work as planned, the first time around, helping patients get better and feel better faster.
particles can be designed to address desired pharmacological benefits, such as optimizing the route of administration, improving solubility, enhancing stability or extending therapeutic effects, with the goal of improving efficacy, safety and convenience for the patient.
This simple, elegant solution is applicable across therapeutic areas, molecule and routes of administration, and offers the opportunity to engineer a range of medicines, including drugs and biologics, single agents and combinations, and vaccines.
Drug delivery have been hampered in adapting to specific challenges, including the drug’s chemical properties. By controlling size, composition and/or shape, the technology can deliver on the potential of drug delivery to improve medicines broadly.
technology allows for rapid transition of PRINT-enabled therapies from the laboratory, to clinical development, to scalable commercial production.
technology changes drug formulation and production through novel and precise engineering techniques, which we believe will enhance clinical efficacy.
This flexible technology can work across a wide range of therapies, according to third-party reviews .
In many cases, pharmaceutical companies can reduce manufacturing costs and complexity, thanks to PRINT’s highly-repeatable and efficient particle fabrication processes.
Marketplace
is applying technology toward internal product development opportunities. The pipeline strategy is focused on improving currently approved products in order to minimize development risk and increase speed to market.
By leveraging technology, Liquidia’s business model is highly capital efficient in the following ways:
is able to improve existing drugs to reach their full therapeutic potential, without having to incur all of the R&expenses of a truly novel molecule.
is a cost-effective, elegant and simple manufacturing process that can create significant improvement in the performance of existing medicines.
Current product candidates in clinical development span LIQ861 for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and LIQ865 for local, post-operative pain . Liquidia’s partners including leading pharmaceutical companies such as GlaxoSmithKline, are exploring ways to leverage technology for new therapies.
