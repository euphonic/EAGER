We believe in equal opportunities for all
- 42% of our board members are women. 
- So are 40% of our new hires and 21% of our global leadership. 
- With inclusive practices, like a Global Family Leave policy, our talented people can focus on bold ideas.
Find out why talented people choose Manage your unique life and work
Our inclusive Global Family Leave policy supports the diverse needs of all our people. So no matter who you are, where in the world you live or how you manage your unique life and work, you can always be at your best.
Proud to be in the 2018 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index!
The index provides a unique barometer of gender-equality performance across sectors worldwide. This reinforces our strong commitment to an inclusive, diverse culture and long-standing efforts to promote gender equality.
Diversity is BEAUTIFUL
At Electric, we provide equal opportunities to everyone everywhere and to ensure all employees feel uniquely valued and safe to contribute their best
As part of a greater diversity and inclusion ambition, is introducing the global family leave policy so that all its employees can manage their unique life and work.


North American employees will be provided with 100% paid leave to welcome a child into the home.
It is a truly inclusive policy that will be applied to all employees worldwide, no matter who they are or where in the world they may be.


It is also inclusive by addressing various leave needs-parental, care and bereavement.
 
"am happy to announce that our new Global Family Leave policy aims to strengthen our commitment to diversity and inclusion which is an integral part of who we are as a company." 

North America now offers:
• 12 weeks of fully paid leave for primary care-giver (birth or adoption)
• 2 weeks of fully paid leave for secondary care-giver (birth or adoption)
• 1 week of care leave for elderly or critically ill family members
• 1 week of bereavement for immediate family
• 2 floating days that can be used for cultural activities
What can our North American employees expect?
• Employees can spend more time with their families for significant life events.
• Employees no longer have to make a choice between time spent working and time spent with family during their major life events.
• All employees* will benefit from this policy equally.
Applies to all employees who qualify for benefits based on our standard benefits-eligibility requirements and policy eligibility conditions.
"Our policies are designed to support our employees to manage effectively their work-life and family needs at different stages in life. These policies support our diverse workforce and allow our employees to contribute their best and make a difference. The well-being of our staff is our highest priority and we’re proud to champion this issue as part of our goal to be best-in-class in every area of our organization."
- Annette Clayton, President and CEO, North America Operations, Celebrating our second year as a HeforShe Champion
September 20, we celebrate the third year of the HeForShe movement and our second year as an 10x10x10 champion. The HeForShe 10x10x10 initiative brings together 10 heads of state, 10 global CEOs and 10 University Presidents, who chose to act as role models in setting the tone for global gender equality.
