It’s a rapidly growing market, and everything we do is focused on understanding light’s impact on human behavior, and delivering products that create better environments and experiences.

Where are solutions? 
Everywhere. Our arry and chip product platforms are the ambience in high-end retail, hospitality spaces and restaurants. It’s the efficiency of high bay lights for warehouses and factories. Outdoors, we add safety and illumination to building exteriors, parking lots, roadways and landscapes.
