Our History
What We Do
Social Media
Valuing everyone's contribution isn't just something we talk about. It's what we put into practice each day. 
The different backgrounds, ideas and views of our employees drive our success. Our commitment to building a diverse and inclusive environment is foundational to our 
Values
 that guide how we interact every day. We believe each person is accountable for creating and sustaining an inclusive work environment.
Employee Networks
For more than 30 years, our 
employee networks
 have provided an important forum for discussion, development and connection to our communities. These networks are led by employees with guidance and involvement from leadership. Open to all employees, these groups raise awareness about important topics and help influence change.
Supplier Diversity
We identify and facilitate opportunities to utilize products and services from businesses owned by women and minorities. Our 
supplier diversity
 team builds relationships with diverse suppliers and provides guidance to position them for current or future projects. 
Sustaining Progress
We link our inclusion efforts to our daily activities. During the recruiting and selection process, we bring in diverse candidates and create balanced interview teams to mitigate unconscious bias. In the U.S., we’ve banned salary history inquiries from our hiring process. Globally, our leaders participate in 
Talent Management Teams
 that review employee development and career progression by skills and location.
Most locations offer flexible work schedules to help employees balance personal and work responsibilities. In the U.S., we’ve worked to equalize our policies by offering 
parental leave
 to fathers, mothers, domestic partners and adoptive parents.
Recognition
In 2017, the Human Rights Campaign’s 
Corporate Equality Index
 recognized us for our commitment to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality in the workplace. In 2018, we were named as a Best Employer for Diversity by Forbes and listed as one of the Top 25 Companies for Diversity by the Texas Diversity Council.
While we have been recognized for our inclusion efforts, we know that it takes ongoing commitment to make sustainable progress. So, we continue to teach and train on inclusion, reinforce accountability at all levels of our organization, and focus on behaviors and processes that build an environment where everyone has the opportunity to succeed.

Water stewardship and continued innovation are key to solving global water challenges
With nearly two-thirds of the world’s population predicted to be living in severe water and biodiversity stressed conditions by 2025, we realize that holistic water stewardship and continued innovation are key to solving global water challenges. Through our charitable investments, we partner with communities and institutions to advance conservation, skill building and improve access to technology. This deep commitment to water and biodiversity is important to our operations and is integrated into the planning, exploration, development and production over the life of our assets.
