th
 Annual Storybook Ball in San Diego, California.
Veteran’s Day is a time to honor the sacrifices so many have made for our families country. For most, it’s a sacrifice that includes leaving loved ones at home. United Through Reading (UTR) understands the sacrifices made by military families, has made it their mission to unite military families facing physical separation during deployment.
serves deployed servicemen women by giving them the opportunity to connect with their families through the read-aloud experience. Military family members are recorded reading popular children’s storybooks on DVDs, which are then shipped to their children at home. Not only do these recordings give military families a way to maintain important emotional connections, but statistics also reveal a positive influence of read-aloud recordings for children – including improvement in literacy language skills, vocabulary development growth encouragement toward a long-term interest in reading.
For nine years now, has been a proud partner in helping fulfill its mission to unite military families through storytelling.  Beginning with a major sponsorship of the annual Storybook Ball in 2009, has continued its support for several programs, including all five Tribute to Military Families dinners, the 40 Million Stories campaign, multiple Storybook Balls. 
On November 10, 2018, was title-sponsor for the 10
th
 Annual Storybook Ball in San Diego, California. This year’s Storybook Ball also marked an exciting new chapter for the Systems-partnership, with the debut launch of the new 
Mobile Story Station
.
 In an effort to reach even more service members their families, the branded customized Ford Transit will routinely visit locations military families frequent, including exchanges, commissaries, libraries, locations, military bases other work sites to maximize visibility accessibility. Military members will be able to record stories for their families in the Systems-Mobile Story Station.
With more than 100,000 military parents leaving nearly 250,000 children at home each year, UTR, with Systems’ support, continues to find new ways to close these gaps ensure that every military child has access to a bedtime story – no matter the distance.
Check out the debut of the new Mobile Story Station!
