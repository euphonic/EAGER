Sample storage at cryogenic and extremely low temperatures provides security for biological specimens and derivatives of those specimens, genomic material, and compounds over extended periods of time. Preserving the information associated with stored samples is a critical part of the storage process, as unidentified samples in storage are unusable and serve no purpose. Thermo Scientific has proven solutions to track and preserve your samples.
