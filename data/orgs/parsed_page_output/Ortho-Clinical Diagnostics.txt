                  Ortho Clinical Named Trailblazer 2018 Company of the Year by PM360
Sep 14, 2018
Recognized as One of the Most Influential Companies in the Medical Device/Diagnostic Category
RARITAN, - Ortho Clinical (Ortho), a global leader of in vitro diagnostics, has been named The Trailblazer 2018 Company of the Year in the Medical Device/Category by PM360, a respected publication for marketing decision-makers in the pharmaceutical, biotech and medical device industries. This recognition, selected by the PM360 Editorial Advisory Board, recognizes companies that have made a significant impact in the health care industry through achievements in innovation, social responsibility and talent development.
“Since becoming an independent company in 2014, Ortho has steadily grown revenues and installed customer base, all while delivering dozens of products that improve lab operations and enable new diagnostic insights,” said Martin Madaus, chairman and of Ortho Clinical Diagnostics. “This recognition from PM360 is an honor for all the employees who have worked hard to grow the company while serving the needs of our customers.”
Innovation:
Since the 2014 carve-out from its former parent company, Ortho has achieved steady, year-over-year growth, while delivering critical new products for the clinical labs and immunohematology communities. Among recent key launches: Ortho’s VITROS® 7600 Integrated System, a next-generation clinical lab analyzer that brings digital chemistry to diagnostics; and VISION® Platform, the first fully automated portfolio of immunohematology instruments, which analyze blood for use in transfusion.  The company is on track to deliver more than 60 new or enhanced assays from 2014 to 2018. 
Ortho is equally committed to innovation in customer service and support.  The award-winning, top-ranked Ortho Care™ program employs remote monitoring, predictive analytics and e-connectivity functionality to maximize uptime and reliability of Ortho technology installed in customer sites around the world.
Social Responsibility:
Ortho has helped to significantly reduce the environmental footprint of its customers around the world, because Ortho’s proprietary dry slide technology does not require water or drains to operate. In contrast, the systems of other in vitro companies use enough water to fill thousands, even millions, of 8-ounce water bottles.1 Ortho is the only global provider of dry slide technology.
Ortho is just as determined to support sustainability at its own sites.The company’s global headquarters in Raritan, N.J., is recognized as an Environmental Stewardship Site by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. Ortho’s global center of excellence for R&in Rochester, N.Y., is a member of the New York Green Business Program (formerly the Environmental Leaders Program), one of only 14 companies in New York certified as a charter member of the program, which recognizes superior environmental performance.  Worldwide, Ortho reduced landfill waste by 17 percent from 2015 to 2017, and achieved a zero landfill status at its Pencoed, Wales facility in 2016 and 2017.
Talent Development:
Ortho shaped a distinct culture that emphasizes talent management and the company’s commitment to customers. The results illustrate a great place to work: ninety-eight percent of legacy employees followed Ortho into independence and more than 2,200 employees have joined the company since 2014. In addition, Ortho was recognized as a Great Place To Work® in India earlier this year.
“As a winner of the medical device and category, Ortho demonstrated incredible work in delivering innovation, social responsibility and talent development in one of the most critical sectors of the health care industry,” said Anna Stashower, and Publisher of PM360. “Ortho is on the frontlines and leading the charge in diagnostics. We are proud to honor and put the spotlight on this innovative organization.”
Ortho Clinical was honored during a special reception at Gotham Hall in New York City on Thursday, September 13, 2018.
About Ortho Clinical Ortho Clinical is a global leader of in vitro serving the clinical laboratory and immunohematology communities.

{}Clears VITROS® 7600 Integrated System from Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Bringing Innovative New Approach to Clinical Lab Management
Nov 1, 2018
CHEMISTRY™ Technology Enables Powerful Data Intelligence, Operational Improvements and Other Enhancements in the Lab
RARITAN, – Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, a global leader of in vitro diagnostics, today announced that it has received clearance for Ortho’s VITROS® 7600 Integrated System .
With this approval, Ortho introduces CHEMISTRY™ technology to clinical lab management in the by combining Ortho’s proprietary MicroSlide technology with sophisticated digital imaging capabilities and the potential to perform two separate lab tests simultaneously. CHEMISTRY™ brings powerful data intelligence, operational improvements and heightened quality to the lab to help clinical laboratories keep pace with a rapidly evolving global health care environment, without requiring additional lab space.
“It’s an exciting time for clinical labs, and today’s clearance of Ortho’s VITROS® 7600 System represents a fundamental improvement in the way labs can operate, now and in the future,” said Jennifer Paine, Ortho’s Chief Product Portfolio Officer.  “VITROS® 7600, along with CHEMISTRY™, harnesses the power of our proprietary dry slide technology to deliver high-quality test results and higher throughput -- all within the lab’s existing physical footprint.”
The CHEMISTRY™ behind Ortho’s VITROS® 7600 is based on three enabling technologies:
Digital imaging technology.  Advanced optics glean significantly more information from testing than before, improving performance and enabling powerful data analysis.
MicroSlide. full testing environment on a postage-stamp-sized piece of film enables precise and accurate testing.
Dry technology. Unlike traditional wet chemistry systems, which require highly purified water and complex plumbing systems to operate, Ortho’s proprietary dry slide technology does not require water to run.  This eliminates the risk that poor water quality could impact test results.
“Ortho’s MicroSlide, paired with Intellichek monitoring, allows me to sleep at night because know the results reported by our technologists on more than 1,000 patients nightly are accurate,” said Jaime Calnan, Laboratory Manager at Central Ohio Primary Care Physicians in Columbus, Ohio. “We have been an Ortho customer for more than ten years, and we welcome this new innovation.”
In addition, Ortho’s VITROS® 7600 will introduce multi-test processing1 – the potential to offer two tests per slide instead of one -- to clinical chemistry. Multi-test processing1 will allow the instrument to simultaneously perform tests that are frequently ordered for the same patient. This saves time and space in the lab, and increases productivity, with less patient sample required for testing, an important advantage for vulnerable patients or those with venous access issues.
The Ortho VITROS® 7600 Integrated System has received clearance to market, and will be available for purchase in the first quarter of 2019. The product is currently available for purchase in numerous countries in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, Latin America and Canada.
