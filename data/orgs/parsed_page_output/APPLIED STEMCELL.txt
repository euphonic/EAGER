About Us
Inc. (ASC) is a fast growing biotechnology company headquartered in Milpitas, California.
Our goal is to advance
 gene-editing and stem cell innovation
 for biomedical research and the biotechnology industry.
After years of research and development, is proud to offer an optimized series of tools for basic research study, drug discovery, bio-processing, bio-production and preclinical applications.
We are currently focusing on three areas:
Cell line generation for bio-production and bioassays
Patient-relevant cell models for personalized medicine and
Physiologically predictive animal models of human diseases
We are striving to improve and expand our technologies and product lines to meet the increasing requirements of the biomedical community.
Establishing disease-specific isogenic models
Developing master cell lines for antibody/protein production
Generating iPSCs from patients containing the corrected mutations or inserted genes for pre-clinical applications
Generating animal models (mouse/rat models)
Using our TARGATT™ technology, a gene-of-interest can be specifically inserted at a well-characterized, transcriptionally active locus in the genome with guaranteed transgene expression.
This site-specific Knock-in technology has been first established in mouse models, and we have successfully it to human cell lines.
We are moving forward to various projects that will combine the CRISPR/Cas9 technology and TARGATT™ for highly specified transgene expression.
Our therapeutic pipeline will have a strong focus on monogenic blood disorders that are characterized by high genetic penetrance.
Such diseases are a strong point for the company, which specializes in the genetic engineering of stem cell lineages.

Our Therapeutic Development Timeline:
Our genome editing Alt-has 
2 to 7-fold higher
 gene knockin efficiency than CRISPR/HDR
Current Knock-in strategy
CRISPR/Cas9-induced
Improved Knock-in

CRISPR/Cas9-induced DSB
Advantages of Our Gene Editing Therapy:
Lifetime Effect: Therapeutic gene integrated into the genome instead of episomal
Safe: Site--specific gene integration
High Potency and efficact: New capsids
Lower immunogenicity: Lower viral dose
Lower cost
