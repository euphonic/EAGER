At Xerox, sustainability is our way of doing business. We align our goals for the environment, health and safety in five key areas to make an impact across our value chain worldwide. Together with our suppliers, customers and stakeholders, we strive to maintain the highest standards for preserving our environment and protecting and enhancing the health and safety of our employees and communities.
Environment, Health, Safety and Sustainability
Carbon Footprint Reduction a Priority at We're lowering the carbon footprint of our equipment, meeting Energy Star requirements and lowering greenhouse gas emissions.
Paper and Recycled Paper | Sustainable Cycle at Paper sourcing, paper use, recycled paper and eco friendly paper offerings are designed to preserve forests and the environment.
Clean Air and Clean Water from Clean Manufacturing
Clean manufacturing efforts over the years to remove toxic chemicals result in clean air and clean water in product lifecycles.
Waste Gets Cut from Recycling Efforts
Waste management is producing products that use resources efficiently, minimizing waste and recycling what can't be reused.
Minimizing Hazardous Chemicals in Products
minimizes hazardous chemicals in equipment, toner, paper, etc. with strict internal standards and requirements of suppliers.
Ensuring health and safety
The health and safety of our people, workplaces, and customers is of paramount importance.
