milestones
The founder of Roche, Fritz Hoffmann-La Roche, was a pioneering entrepreneur who was convinced that the future belonged to branded pharmaceutical products.
1896
The founding year – first successes
Hoffmann-La & Co. was founded at a time when industrial revolution was changing the face of Europe. On October 1, 1896, at the age of 28, Fritz Hoffmann-La launched his company as the successor company to Hoffmann, Traub & Co in Basel, Switzerland. He was among the first to recognise that the industrial manufacture of medicines would be a major advance in the fight against disease. Since then, has grown into one of the world's leading healthcare companies.
Product Development
First products
Pharmacist Carl Schaerges, the first head of research, together with chemist Emil Barell demonstrate the presence of iodine in thyroid extracts. This results in Roche’s first patent and scientific publications. The launch of Aiodin marks the earliest in a series of thyroid preparations by Roche.
Product Development
High hopes for wound antiseptic
launches Airol, a wound antiseptic originally developed by Hoffmann, Traub & Co. The young company has high hopes for Airol on the German market. buys land in the nearby German farming community of Grenzach and builds a small factory to produce Airol.
Expansion and internationalisation
soon expands its business activities. From 1897 to 1910, the factory in Grenzach, Germany, is enlarged and the lion’s share of manufacturing moves there. Fritz Hoffmann-La and his new partner Carl Meerwein waste little time in building a network of European and overseas agents and subsidiaries. By 1914 has offices in Milan, New York, St. Petersburg, and London, among others.
Product Development
Orange-flavoured success
produces a non-prescription cough syrup containing its own active ingredient, Thiocol. The orange-flavoured syrup is an almost immediate success. Launched under the trademark Sirolin in 1898, the syrup remains on the market for over 60 years.
Innovation
grows quickly
With assistance from Roche, Max Cloëtta produces a pure, standardised digitalis preparation containing all the cardiac glycosides of the purple fox-glove leaf. The preparation is free of unnecessary ingredients and displays a uniform efficacy. launches the preparation under the trademark Digalen in 1904. Digalen proves to be exactly what the medical profession has been looking for – it stays on the market until 1964.
The analgesic and hypnotic Pantopon (1909) and Sedobrol (1912), a drug for epilepsy and nervous disorders, are also released as grows and expands its portfolio.
Innovation
Cooperation against pain
Hermann Sahli, head of the medical department at the University Hospital in Bern, contacts research director Carl Schaerges. Sahli proposes a combination of all opium alkaloids that offers advantages over the individual compounds. Discussions with Sahli and extensive studies done under Schaerges result in the analgesic Pantopon, which is launched in 1909.
Corporate Development
expands worldwide
From 1897 to 1914 expands worldwide, employing more than 700 people in Basel, Grenzach, Milan, Paris, Berlin, Vienna, St. Petersburg, London, New York and Yokohama. During this period, strives for strong cooperation between academic circles and commercial  developers. Until 1915, all innovations result from such cooperation.
The time of crisis
The First World War has devastating repercussions for Roche. The German boycott of its products, Basel’s isolation from its plant in Grenzach, Germany, the loss of the company’s Russian market and assets in the revolution of 1917, and sizeable foreign exchange losses combine to create a financial crisis. In response, is transformed legally into a limited company. Additionally, bemoans the death of founding father and visionary Fritz Hoffmann in 1920. glimmer of hope arises with the classic study by Markus Guggenheim of biogenic amines, which enhances Roche’s standing in the scientific community.
People of Fritz Hoffmann dies
Founding father Fritz Hoffmann dies of kidney disease on 18 April 1920, depriving of a dynamic entrepreneur and a striking individual. “At every step it was [Fritz Hoffmann] who determined the company’s direction, guiding it to bigger and better things with his vision, restless energy, infectious spontaneity and indomitable optimism,” said Emil Barell in a eulogy for Hoffmann. Barell becomes the new Chief Executive.
People of First steps towards synthetic vitamins
Markus Guggenheim publishes a classic study of biogenic amines in 1920. begins marketing what it calls biochemicals. These include amino acids, peptides, proteins, cardiac glycosides, vitamins and hormones – all substances that the company originally produced for its own research projects. The biochemicals enhance Roche’s standing in the scientific community. In 1927 Guggenheim begins studying vitamin B1. His investigations include work with extracts of rice bran, which will ultimately contribute to the synthesis and production of vitamin B1 at Roche.
Social Engagement
Pension fund for employees
1921 sees the creation of the “Beamten- und Arbeiterpensionskasse Roche”, a pension fund for office and factory staff. The occasion is Roche’s 25th anniversary. In addition, Chief Executive Emil Barell personally endows a special fund to provide gifts to employees who have completed 25 years of service.
People of Roche’s first woman executive
Alice Keller, a 30-year-old native of Basel, boards ship to Japan in 1926. Phgraduate in political economics she has worked at Basel for about a year before accepting a post in Tokyo, where the company formed a subsidiary in 1925. She starts as a kind of girl Friday, handling correspondence, revising documents and doing some of the billing and costing. When she returns in 1939, Keller has risen to the senior executive ranks of Direktorin – a sensational achievement for the times.
Product Development
Strengthening of synthetic production
Allonal is introduced in 1920. The analgesic sedative and hypnotic drug is the first product to use compounds produced by synthetic chemistry. An industrial laboratory is built in Basel to develop synthetic processes.
Vitamin boost overcomes the crisis
managed to overcome the crisis under the leadership of chairman Emil Barell. The company experienced an unexpected upsurge spurred by its vitamin production, which made the return to former prosperity possible. is able to expand once more and starts its strong commitment to the US-American market with first investments in New York and Nutley.
Corporate Development
Investment in the USA

Corporate Development
Enlargement of Swiss headquarters
In Basel, work proceeds on a new administration building designed by architect Otto Salvisberg. native of Bern, Salvisberg has already made a name for himself with several projects in Berlin. Completed in 1935, the elegant simplicity of administrative Building 21 is impressive even today.
Product Development
Success story for vitamins
Tadeusz Reichstein (Nobel Prize winner 1950) offers a workable method of synthesising vitamin year later the first 50 kilograms of vitamin are produced, marking the start of vitamin manufacturing at Roche. The first vitamin preparation, Redoxon, is launched.
becomes the leading supplier of vitamins, having also mastered the industrial synthesis of vitamin A, B1, B2, and K1. By 1938, vitamins are the company’s mainstay, encompassing Benerva (vitamin B1), Nestrovit (multi-vitamin), Beflavin (vitamin B2) and Ephynal (vitamin E).
Streamlining and improving production
Vitamin output increases and new production locations strengthen Roche’s position as one of the main producers of vitamins. To avoid a strong dependency on vitamins, intensifies pharmaceutical research. Between the early 1950s and mid-1960s pharmaceutical research is extremely diverse, with a portfolio of pharmaceuticals ranging from antidepressants and antimicrobials to agents for cancer chemotherapy. During this period, Roche’s researchers discover a compound of the benzodiazepine class that sedates without causing drowsiness.
Corporate Development
In 1945 establishes Pantene Corporation and affiliate cosmetic companies. The companies employ 4,000 – 1,200 alone in Basel and 2,000 in Nutley, USA.
Product Development
Tranquilliser production starts
In the mid-1950s a new group of sedatives, known as tranquillisers, is introduced into clinical use. Returning to a group of compounds he has worked on previously, Leo Sternbach chances upon benzodiazepines. One of them, Ro 5-0690, later launches as Librium. Tranquillisers soon become one of Roche’s most important product segments. This success, combined with a push to streamline vitamin production, fuels a period of unprecedented growth.
Product Development
First anti-cancer drug

The  Board of Directors  represents the Group's owners (its shareholders and the holders of non-voting equity securities). It is responsible for the successful long-term management of the Group and therefore makes the strategic decisions and decides the structure of the business. In order to perform its role as efficiently as possible, the Board of Directors appoints four  board committees , each of which has a specific remit.
The Board of Directors assigns responsibility for the operational management of the company – i.e. all specific short to medium-term measures – to the  Corporate Executive Committee . Consequently, the Corporate Executive Committee is also appointed and monitored by the Board of Directors.
As a body, the Corporate Executive Committee deals solely with operational matters that affect all divisions and functions – i.e. the company as a whole. The individual members of the Corporate Executive Committee, however, carry out all managerial tasks in relation to their individual business area (division or function).
This clear separation is set out in the  Bylaws of Holding Ltd , and is consistent with the directives for Swiss companies and relevant statutory norms of the Swiss Code of Obligations.

Our Business Priorities
We believe in the importance of having a clear set of priorities to guide us through a turbulent and ever-changing environment. Our aim is to achieve long term sustainable growth and deliver value to all our stakeholders.

Focus on patients
We focus on developing innovative medicines and diagnostic tests that help patients live longer, better lives. Two-thirds of all diseases are either still not treated adequately or not treated at all. This medical need is enormous and better diagnostics and medicines can make a huge difference to the lives of millions of patients and their families.
Excellence in science
We strive to address unmet medical needs through excellence in science. Breakthroughs in science and technology increasingly allow us to find out precisely what is malfunctioning in the body and develop drugs to counter the problem. We focus on oncology, immunology, ophthalmology, infectious diseases and neuroscience, however we remain flexible and follow the science as new insights become available.
Personalised Healthcare
We combine our strengths in pharmaceuticals and diagnostics to better fit treatments to patients. When genetic differences can be identified, the efficacy and safety of medicines can be improved enormously. To this end we have a companion diagnostic strategy for every molecule we develop.
Access to healthcare
We aim to bring our medicines and diagnostic tests to as many people in need as possible. Every healthcare system comes with different challenges and we customise solutions for individual markets. We work with many different local partners to reduce barriers to accessing healthcare and establish innovative, sustainable ways to bring effective and affordable healthcare to patients.
Great workplace
We are committed to constantly strengthening and maintaining an excellent workplace where every person feels valued and respected and can grow to his or her full potential. Our people make our business. They discover, develop and manufacture our products and ensure they reach the patients who need them. We believe that the key to our success lies in our ability to attract, retain and motivate a highly skilled and diverse workforce.
Sustainable value
We run our business in a way that is ethical and aims to create long-term value for all stakeholders.  We want to create value through developing medical solutions and we aim for as many people to benefit from them as possible. We believe that our success lies in our ability to develop strategies where both industry and society benefit in a sustainable way.

Our strategy
We focus on finding new medicines and diagnostics that help patients live longer, better lives and evolve the practice of medicine.
We are guided by our purpose: Doing now what patients need next. Our company has a 120-year history of advancing the field of medicine and bringing novel treatments and diagnostics to patients. The patient is and will remain at the core of what we do, the reason we come to work every day.
What we do
Our focus
Our focus is on fitting treatments to patients: providing the right therapy for the right group of people at the right time. With our in-house combination of Pharmaceuticals and Diagnostics, we are uniquely positioned to deliver personalised healthcare. We are developing our internal capabilities and building strategic partnerships ready for the next stage in personalised healthcare: to combine insights from multiple data sources with sophisticated analytics to drive more effective and efficient research and allow for better therapeutic decisions for patients. Access to our products is also a critical part of our strategy. Our detailed access plans are embedded into the business at a local level.
We will continue to concentrate our energies entirely on prescription medicines and in vitro diagnostics, rather than diversify into other sectors like generics and biosimilars, over-the-counter medicines and medical devices. 
more
Our distinctiveness
In our pursuit of excellence in science, our distinctiveness rests on four key elements: an exceptionally broad and deep understanding of biology, the seamless integration of our pharmaceuticals and diagnostics capabilities, a diversity of approaches to maximise innovation, and a long-term orientation. 
more
Our delivery
Our delivery is to create value for all our stakeholders: being a partner of choice; bringing significant medical benefit for patients, doctors and payers; offering a great place to work for employees; having a sustainable impact on society; and creating top-quartile total shareholder return for our investors. 
more
How we do it
Our people
In the end, it takes people with integrity, courage and passion to make a difference for patients. It is our people who are proud to say: We are Roche. We embrace the diversity of cultures and people across the Group. We are inclusive and encourage the richness of ideas and approaches this brings. 
more
Our decision making
Our decision-making principles and processes emphasise transparent dialogue, clear accountability, and encourage a high degree of empowerment.
Our structure
Our structure is built for innovation. Our autonomous research and development centres and alliances with over 200 external partners foster diversity and agility. Our global geographical scale and reach enables us to bring our diagnostics and medicines quickly to people who need them.
