Background & Core Technology
Inc., located in Cambridge, MA, was founded in 1998 by a group of former Polaroid scientists and engineers with the goal of developing and applying new and innovative roll-to-roll manufacturing technologies.
While at Polaroid, the founders were responsible for the development of advanced roll-to-roll applications in micro- and nanostructure fabrication, optical data storage, imagine materials, and holography.  Today, continues to develop new manufacturing technology based on core expertise in:
precision micro- and nano-imprinting (“NIL”)
additive and subtractive nanopatterning
In addition, MicroContinuum's staff has extensive capabilities in the design and construction of custom pilot and manufacturing equipment and process-monitoring instrumentation.
