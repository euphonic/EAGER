is the first platform of its kind, a San Francisco based textile studio and technology platform, giving designers access to woven textile production.
Working with textile manufacturers, we have developed a patent pending system for jacquard looms that enables textile production in quantities as small as a single yard. Customers simply access our selection of colors and qualities, apply them to their own designs, and submit for purchase / production. In addition, our platform promotes independent designers through the Collection, a curated fabric and product collection that offers royalties to contributors on every yard sold. We proudly offer this collection to the design community.
In the era of digital fabrication platforms, desktop 3printers and milling machines, our goal is to revolutionize textile production, creating access and immediacy for woven textile development. Start bringing your designs to life!
Founders
partners, Dena and Chelsea Molnar, each contribute individual perspectives and distinct design experience to the firm’s Design + Technology driven focus. With backgrounds in both the textile and architecture industries, the partners have merged their knowledge of the built environment, interiors market, and fabrication of textiles with the development of new technology.
