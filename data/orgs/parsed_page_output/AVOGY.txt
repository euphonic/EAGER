NexGen Power Systems is revolutionizing power electronics with technology solutions utilizing Gaon Gadiscrete semiconductor devices, modules, and systems that increase efficiency and reliability of power conversion systems while dramatically reducing their cost, size, and weight.
We have assembled a world-class team of engineers with proven track records in inventing, developing, and commercializing semiconductor technologies. Our internal expertise and competence encompasses Gaepitaxial growth, materials characterization, device design and processing, electrical characterization, reliability testing, and product development.
Our focus is in developing and manufacturing vertical power semiconductor devices built in homoepitaxial Galayers formed on bulk Gasubstrates. We have established licensing and supply agreements with multiple Gasubstrate vendors, giving us access to the highest quality and lowest cost bulk Gasubstrates.
