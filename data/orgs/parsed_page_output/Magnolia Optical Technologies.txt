Optical-based technology has become increasingly in-demand across a wide range of massive global markets like space, military, automotive, and the industrial sector due to its many benefits, including:       lower maintenance cost, higher performance, improved relaibility and greater data throughput and bandwidth.
components and systems are frequently being implemented in drones, by aerospace and defense engineers for land, sea, air, and space applications, in intelligent transportation systems like smart highways with intelligent traffic lights, automated tollbooths, and changeable message signs, and across the biomedical industry for transmission of digital diagnostic images.
Medical infrared (IR) Imaging, sometimes known as Thermography, offers interesting diagnostics for many diseases, bruises and other surface injuries. It is a technique that can image the temperature distribution, blood flow and other irregularities resulting from various disease related abnormalities. This technique is becoming increasingly popular because of its non-invasive approach. is developing highly sensitive infrared focal plane arrays and tools to assist doctors with unprecedented resolution and sensitivity for accurate diagnostics procedures.
