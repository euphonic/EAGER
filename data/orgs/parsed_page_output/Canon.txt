Laura M.
"am very grateful for my time spent overseas working at Europe. was assigned to the Consumer Imaging Group Digital Services team, specializing in customer acquisition and monetization of two digital apps: Lifecake and the Photo Print Shop. The experience was nothing short of rewarding, both personally and professionally. From a personal standpoint, had the incredible opportunity to visit 18 countries during my stay, soaking in the sights of destinations ranging from Ireland to Istanbul. From a professional standpoint, learned how traditional digital marketing principles apply to digital apps, taking the lead to coordinate marketing materials, launching paid campaigns in support of user growth, and working with my team to create a comprehensive forecast business plan. It was so fulfilling to be tasked with making such important decisions — decisions that will continue to have an impact today — and couldn’t be happier to have had the chance to take advantage of this program.”
Maurice G.
"The 2017 Talent Exchange Program provided me with the opportunity to work with the Professional Service Excellence and Global Services teams in Europe. Being assigned to projects for NSOs from several countries was interesting and challenging, and it helped me to learn the nuances of working with the various European cultures. The knowledge gained from exposure to their processes and procedures is easily transferable to the team as we engage more global opportunities. For a history buff being in England, there wasn’t a shortage of places to see and experience. It was a privilege to be part of such a remarkable program.”
Michele C.
"My participation in the 2017 Talent Exchange Program has been one of the most rewarding and memorable experiences of my life. As a member of Europe’s Internal Audit Department, worked closely with divisional management from the principal Regional Headquarters offices and various National Sales Organizations across Europe. The challenge and excitement of working with different languages, countries, and cultures has had an incredible impact on me, both professionally and personally. was able to approach each organization’s processes, procedures, and internal controls with a fresh perspective, striving to offer insightful opportunities for improvement and constructively challenge the status quo. My interactions with the market have allowed me to deepen my understanding of Canon’s global operations, and am excited to utilize these new skills and knowledge back in  Personally, this experience has allowed me to gain a newfound perspective, appreciation, and understanding of many different cultures, while learning so much about myself in the process. During this past year, was fortunate to be able to travel to 15 countries and numerous cities throughout Europe; was able to see and do things never would have imagined would, while building lasting friendships along the way.  am forever grateful for being given this opportunity and am looking forward to what lies ahead!”
Steven R.
"My experience with the 2017 Exchange Program at Europe and living in London is one will never forget. From the people met to all the countries visited (14 total!), the Talent Exchange Program afforded me a great opportunity to grow both professionally and personally.  gained valuable international business experience and a better understanding of globally while building invaluable relationships. always regretted not living abroad when was younger and never thought would get the opportunity as an adult in my professional life.”

I've had the pleasure of working
for for 10 years.  While ingrained
in the day-to-day activities of Sales and Account Management relationships, it
is easy to lose track of your own personal and professional continuing
education.  In order to continue your
success, it is key for individuals to make time for Learning & Development,
and invests a lot in getting this right.

Welcome to "One Park"
U.S.A., which opened its new headquarters in February 2013 and continues to realize growth, oversees the company's operations in North, Central and South America.
This capped a long journey for U.S.A., which for many years had been searching for a place on Long Island that would be a suitable location to establish a new home.
Located off the Long Island Expressway and near the technology corridor of Route 110, the headquarters features modern amenities and a 52-acre campus.
Measuring more than 500 feet long and nearly 300 feet wide, the building reflects Canon’s strong commitment to environmental sustainability. “One Park” has been awarded LEED® Gold certification, a recognition for the design, construction, operations and maintenance of high-performance green buildings. The facility stands as a model for environmental stewardship and innovation, and is the largest commercial property on Long Island to achieve this level of LEED.
The grounds have an open, campus-like feel with plenty of green space, a walking trail and two retention ponds. Within the five-story building (plus lower level), employees enjoy a state-of-the-art learning center, cafeteria, fitness center and other amenities.
As always, aims to be a good corporate citizen within the community and will continue fostering relationships in the surrounding area.

Meet our Wildly Impressive Team
Preserving the world around us
CANON'CONSERVATION
At the heart of every product, every idea, and every initiative lies the thought, “how will this make the world a better place?” U.S.A.’s deep belief in being socially responsible is what drives our passion and support for programs that support the environment as well as the local communities we’re a part of.
Eyes on Yellowstone
Since 1995, Eyes on Yellowstone, an education and research program, has been made possible through U.S.A.’s proud sponsorship with Yellowstone Forever.
Canon’s sponsorship of Yellowstone Forever contributes to important scientific research and helps break new ground in conservation, endangered species protection, and the application of cutting-edge science and technology that is essential to managing Yellowstone National Park’s delicate ecosystems and wildlife.
Observing from afar
Throughout the park, we’ve helped establish long-term climate change monitoring stations at different elevations – many in hard-to-reach locations. All are capable of collecting photographs, air, and soil temperatures, solar radiation, precipitation, and soil moisture data every day throughout the year, giving the scientists at Yellowstone the ability to “see” what couldn’t be seen before.
Checking in on the “team”
technology is used to keep a close watch over the millions of wild animals that call Yellowstone home. The Yellowstone Wolf Project and Cougar Project are perhaps the best known. The Raven’s Eye View Initiative helps monitor wildlife in large, remote landscapes through the use of digital SLRs in aerial radio-tracking flights. Whether documenting grizzly bear cub production, swan nesting success, elk herd compositions, or new geothermal activity, these images help to enhance scientific data collection and understand how to best protect all of our wild friends.
Stream the steam
When visitors can’t come to the park, we’ve managed to help bring the park to them. The Old Faithful Live webcam is one of the most popular web pages of all of the National Park sites. Streaming live video 24/7, it allows virtual visitors to experience one of America’s most famous monuments from anywhere in the world! By increasing access to the wonder and magic of Yellowstone, we’re helping to raise awareness about the importance of environmental stewardship and conservation.
Sharing the knowledge
The publication Yellowstone Science, which helps to sponsor, is just one of many resources aimed at communicating the science and the story of Yellowstone with researchers, scientists, school groups, park supporters, front-line Yellowstone staff, and the general public.
What’s more, the Greater Yellowstone Science Learning Center website was created to bring science and education together to help preserve and protect this national treasure.
Recognition of our commitment
In March of 2018, was recognized by the Public Lands Alliance with the Corporate Stewardship Award, which recognizes companies that work to help enhance the experience of visitors at public lands within the United States. We are proud to support these critical education and research projects, and to help ensure that Yellowstone’s awe-inspiring wilderness remains intact for generations to come.
Dan Stahler, Park Biologist, Yellowstone National Park
presents 'Study of Wolves' to Melville Employees.

Conservation begins at home
At U.S.A., we don’t just make products that improve people’s lives, we try to design products that have a minimal impact on the environment. In fact, as part of our 14001 certification, we work hard to manage the environmental aspects of our activities, services, and products. In this way, we’re doing more every day to protect places like Yellowstone National Park.
Toner cartridge recycling
In 1990, launched a toner cartridge collection and return program, the first in the industry. It has allowed to recycle cartridges with cooperation from customers. But that’s not all. Canon’s development of recycling technologies helps to reduce our dependence on natural resources and helps to reduce waste.
Energy efficient from top to bottom
takes great pride in the many certifications and partnerships we are a part of, including:
START® - has received a number of awards since 1996 including the 2016 and 2017 Partner of the Year – Product Brand Owner Awards, and the 2018 Partner of the Year – Sustained Excellence Award.
SmartWay® Transport Partnership - In 2015, was awarded the SmartWay Excellence Award for our efforts to reduce transportation-related emissions and improve freight supply chain efficiency.
14001 Certification - Canon’s Environmental Management System is incorporated into business operations for and more than 700 other sites worldwide, and helps the company establish objectives and targets to reduce the environmental impact associated with our activities, services, and products.
EPEAT® - To be added to the Registry, an imaging device must meet strict, comprehensive criteria that considers, among other things, the design, production, longevity, energy efficiency, and use of recycled and recyclable materials with ongoing independent verification of manufacturer claims. For a complete list of EPEAT-registered products and to learn more about the registry visit EPEAT.net .
LEED® Certification - Americas’ Headquarters in New York and Canon’s Customer Experience Center in California have been awarded Gold certification, a prestigious recognition for the design, construction, operations, and maintenance of high-performance green buildings
Committed to being a good corporate citizen and the world community
Being socially responsible has been part of U.S.A.’s culture for decades. In recognizing that our corporate activities are supported by the development of society as a whole, we aim to achieve growth through sound and fair business activities while contributing to the realization of a better society as a good corporate citizen.

Big Data Analysis
Data is becoming larger, devices are becoming smarter, with new 3printers...
How do we leverage Big Data to make cameras smarter?
Open world computer vision is the combination of the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms with information inferred from databases. This can improve the performance of object identification and classification, which can be applied, for example, to network camera solutions.
Computational Imaging 
The goal of the computational imaging research is to come with theoretical and experimental methods to explore unconventional ways to combine digital imaging capture and novel image processing techniques in order to understand better the nature of scenes we capture and provide proof-of-concept and prototyping for core technologies that enables improvement of imaging capabilities and performance. This work is centered on illumination-based physical sensing in which research is conducted on technologies that can be used to measure arbitrary shapes and materials in 3-D.

Healthcare Optics Research Laboratory
Established on the foundation of U.S.A.’s corporate philosophy, 
Kyosei
, in November 2012, entered into collaborative research agreements with Massachusetts General Hospital, and Brigham and Women’s Hospital to develop biomedical optical imaging and medical robotics technologies.
This collaboration lead to the opening of the Healthcare Optics Research Laboratory in Cambridge, Massachusetts in June 2013.
The research laboratory is approximately 13,600 square feet and is the home of skilled employees dedicated to developing biomedical optical imaging and medical robotics technologies with the ultimate goal of bringing medical devices to market for a variety of applications.
The areas that the technology will address include:
Image Guided Therapy
Miniature Endoscopic Imaging
Functional Imaging
Healthcare Optics Research Laboratory, is working in conjunction with its parent company, Inc.
Image Guided Therapy
Miniature Endoscopic Imaging
Functional Imaging
Image Guided Therapy
Image guided therapies provide better outcome by improving diagnostic accuracy and targeted treatment for diseased tissue. Research in image guided therapy includes, a robotic device for guidance of percutaneous interventions of abdominal and thoracic cavity, and a combination of targeted agent delivery and image guided platform to improve treatment efficacy. The overall purpose is to develop platform technologies for broader applications. One application, among many others, for our robotic device is image-guided cryotherapy of kidney cancer

Miniature Endoscopic Imaging
Overall objective is to expand the applications of minimally invasive diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy to areas currently considered unreachable. This project utilizes Canon's strong expertise in innovative imaging and optics solutions and is focused on developing an ultra thin, human hair size, high resolution endoscope that will produce three dimensional images, while enabling direct visualization of 'hard to see' anatomies.
Additionally, a parallel project is focusing on the ability of an endoscope to maneuver through small anatomical spaces by developing robotic multipoint motion. This technology allows to control and navigate, on demand, an endoscope tethered to a console for application in neurosurgery, orthopedics, and laryngoscopy

Functional Imaging
Despite advances in imaging technologies, coronary artery disease is still the most common cause of death globally. number of factors are associated with acute coronary event and understanding its complex relationship with vulnerable plaque could play a key role in managing patient population at risk. efforts are geared towards developing an advanced imaging system and arterial catheter capable of simultaneously obtaining high quality information that enable accurate diagnosis and longitudinal management of disease. Basic principle relies on expanding the scope of imaging from three dimensional structural information to molecular and mechanical properties of coronary plaques. Different methods of understanding both, tissue molecular and mechanical properties are currently being investigated.
Additional research efforts are focused on functional imaging of brain for better understanding of physiological parameters impacted due to an injury or medical treatment such as anesthesia. Technical development includes non-invasive bed side quantification of blood flow and oxygenation to cerebral tissue
