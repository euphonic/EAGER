Yield Management 
The data analysis required to monitor and enhance yield is a huge challenge, especially as data volumes grow large and diverse with shrinking technology nodes.
Product-specific design-process-test interactions have further complicated the path to root cause identification, making it harder for engineers to develop a clear understanding of the nature of yield limiters. products address these complicated analysis requirements with product capabilities tuned for specific user groups.

About SNUG
Your Global Design Community Focused on Innovation
The Users Group (SNUG) was established in 1991 to provide users of design tools and technology with an open forum in which they could exchange ideas, discuss problems and explore solutions. Today, there are 13 conferences worldwide drawing nearly 10,000 tool users, representing more than 900 companies. 

                
                  At the heart of each event is a technical conference focusing on real-world design challenges and featuring peer-reviewed User papers, along with presentations from top technologists and industry experts. Although all conferences maintain a common technical focus, each program is designed with the specific needs of the local design community in mind.
              

                
                  Writing a paper provides an opportunity for you to showcase your unique design and experiences to an audience of your peers. All User papers and presentations are published in the Proceedings Library, with the top papers receiving special recognition, including cash awards, along with being featured on the and SolvNet® online support websites.
              

                
                  is the largest community of design engineers in the world. offers an unequalled opportunity for face-to-face interactions with your industry peers, executives and R&There is no better place to explore common challenges, network with colleagues and make new contacts.

Privacy Policy
is committed to protecting your online privacy on our website. The privacy practices described in this privacy policy apply to synopsys.com and to all of our websites and wholly owned subsidiary websites (collectively, the “Site”). This privacy policy does not cover any other data collection or processing, including, without limitation, data collection practices of other websites to which we link or data that we or our affiliates collect offline or through web pages that do not display a direct link to this privacy policy.
We strive to treat your personal information as safely and securely as reasonably possible. Please read the following privacy policy to better understand how your personal information may be collected and used as you access various areas of our Site. As described below, your information may be collected by Synopsys, Inc. (“Synopsys”), disclosed to third parties, and used by third parties and Synopsys. This privacy policy describes the information we collect about you and what may happen to that information. Some of the reasons why we collect your personal information include:
Register to access certain parts of the Site
Register to subscribe to newsletters, attend events, participate in classes, or receive information about products and technology
Participate in discussion forums
Provide registered users a more personalized and meaningful experience on the Site
We occasionally employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include fulfilling orders, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and processing credit card payments. These third party service providers have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes. We do not sell, rent, share, or otherwise disclose personally identifiable information from customers for commercial purposes.
Collection of Personally Identifiable Information
REGISTRATION
In order to use certain protected areas of this Site, such as SolvNet® support, DesignWare® Download Request, or to request a white paper, you first must complete a registration form and/or create a user name and password. During registration you are required to give contact information (such as name and email address). We may use this information to contact you about the services on our Site in which you have expressed interest. This information may also be shared with subsidiaries and business partners.
APPLICATIONS
If you submit your resume online for a job opening, we require that you provide certain personally identifiable information, including your name, address, phone number, and employment and education history. This information is necessary to process your application and to contact you. If you are offered a job or become employed by or one of its direct or indirect subsidiaries, it will also be used for other employment-related purposes. By submitting your resume and any other application materials to us, you agree that we may use such information for recruitment, hiring and employment purposes (including transferring the data to other countries, transferring your information to other companies authorized to perform specific services for Synopsys, and/or other processing relevant to recruitment purposes).
Resumes should include information relevant to your employment history and education. Candidates should not disclose sensitive personal characteristics (gender, height, weight, religion, philosophical or political beliefs, financial data, etc.) in their communications.
CONTESTS
From time to time we may provide you the opportunity to participate in contests or surveys on our Site. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code).
We use this information to notify contest winners and award prizes, and sometimes to send participants an email newsletter if requested.
In some cases, we may use a third party service provider to conduct these surveys or contests; any such provider is prohibited from using our users’ personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
"ARTICLE" REFERRALS
If you choose to use the "Email this article" function (on web pages where it is available) in order to send another person the article, we will ask you for the recipient's email address and your email address. We will automatically send the recipient a one-time email that includes a text-only version of the article.
Collection of Non-Personally Identifiable Information
FILES
As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, and date/time stamp.
We use this information to analyze trends, to administer the Site, to track users’ movements around the Site, to enhance your experience in using our Site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. This information is used to better understand and improve the usability, performance and effectiveness of Synopsys' Site.
COOKIES
Some web pages use “cookies,” which are small files saved on your computer. Cookies help us recognize your user preferences and can improve your future web visits. You can set your web browser to notify you when you are receiving a cookie and choose to reject it. However, rejecting cookies may affect the performance of the Site and prevent you from accessing certain information.
Additionally, we may also permit third-party vendors, such as Google, to place cookies in your browser so that we may advertise our products to you on other websites that you may visit. You can opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting Google’s Ads Settings page: http://www.google.com/settings/ads ; you can also opt-out from many other third-party vendors’ use of cookies by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative’s Consumer Opt-Out page: http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/#completed .
Communications
UPDATES
We may occasionally send you information on products, services, and training or events that might be of interest to you.
Out of respect for your privacy, we present the option not to receive these types of communications. Please see the " Choice and Opt-out " section of this Policy.
NEWSLETTERS
If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, we provide you a way to unsubscribe. Please see the " Choice and Opt-out " section.
SERVICE-ANNOUNCEMENTS
We may send you strictly service-related announcements on rare occasions when it is necessary to do so. For instance, if you are a customer and we have a support announcement related to the product you are using, we might send you an email. Because these communications are not promotional, the Choice and Opt-out provision does not apply.
Information Sharing and Disclosure
We may occasionally share personally identifiable information with third parties acting as either agents or service providers acting on our behalf.
& PROVIDERS
We may use an outside shipping company to fulfill orders, and a credit card processing company to bill you for services. We use other third parties to provide certain specific services on our Site, such as discussion forums and registration for certain classes and events.
When you sign up for these particular services, we may share your personal information as necessary with authorized third party agents or contractors in order to provide the requested service or transaction. For example, if we need to ship something to you, we must share your name and address with a shipping company.
We only provide third party agents and service providers with the minimum amount of personal information necessary to complete the requested service or transaction. We do not permit these companies to share or use personally identifiable information for any other purposes.
DISCLOSURES
We reserve the right to disclose your personally identifiable information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process.
FORUMS
Any personally identifiable information you provide to in the registration process for a discussion forum or user forum (“Discussion Forum”) shall be kept confidential. However, if you use a Discussion Forum on this Site, you should be aware that any personally identifiable information you post in a publicly viewable area there can be read, collected, or used by other users of these forums, and could be used to send you unsolicited messages. We are not responsible for the use by others of personally identifiable information you choose to submit in these forums.
SITES
This Site contains links to other websites that are not owned or controlled by Synopsys. Please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other websites. When you leave our Site, we encourage you to be aware and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information.
Access to Personally Identifiable Information
We need your help in keeping the personally identifiable information you share with us accurate and up to date. Please notify us of any changes to your personal information.
OPT-OUT
If you no longer wish to receive a particular newsletter and promotional communication, you may opt out of receiving it by following the instructions included in each respective newsletter or communication, or by accessing Synopsys’ Subscriptions Center . Please note that other data recipients have their own data privacy policies, which may differ from ours, and you would have to contact them separately with respect to opt-out requests.
Security
Transmissions over the Internet are never 100% secure or error-free. However, security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information (such as a credit card number) on our registration forms, we encrypt that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL). We follow generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.
It is your responsibility to safeguard any password and user you use to access the Site and to notify us at privacy@synopsys.com if you ever suspect that this password or user has been compromised. You are solely responsible for any unauthorized use of the Site conducted via your password and user ID.
Effective Date and Changes
This Policy is effective May 16, 2018. If we decide to change our privacy policy, we may post those changes to the privacy policy URL, and other places we deem appropriate so that you are aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.
We reserve the right to modify this privacy statement at any time, so please review it frequently. If we make material changes to this policy, we will post the revised policy here. When you visit the Site, you are accepting the current version of this privacy policy as posted on the Site at that time.

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding our privacy policy, please contact us at privacy@synopsys.com .

Trademarks and Brands
Trademarks and Brands
trademarks, service marks, logos, and brands (referred to here as “trademarks”) are Synopsys’ valuable intellectual property assets. trademarks must be used properly and only to the extent as permitted by Synopsys. The following guidelines apply to employees, customers, licensees, consultants, outside vendors, and any other third parties. Follow these guidelines to ensure correct and consistent use of trademarks.
Guidelines
1. Use a trademark as an adjective followed by a generic noun (or as a standalone graphical element, such as on packaging), as a noun or a verb. Do not pluralize a trademark or make it possessive.
Does the sentence still make sense if you remove the trademark from the sentence? If yes, then your use is proper. If not, you need to add something like the generic words “software”, “tool”, “library”, “model”, “core”, etc. after the trademark.
Proper use example: Using Synopsys’ DesignWare® libraries, customer can achieve. . .
Improper use example: Using DesignWare®, customers can achieve . . .
2.  Accompany a trademark with the proper symbol (e.g., ® or ™)
The first appearance of the trademark in any given use must be followed by the appropriate trademark symbol. It is acceptable to omit a symbol in headlines, titles, subheads, diagrams or tops of slides, but the next use must include the appropriate symbol.
Exception: is a trademark but it is also our company name. When referring to as a company name, it is okay to use it as a noun and not to have the ® or ™ symbol, e.g., "reports widespread adoption. . ."
If the symbols cannot be used in superscript mode, use parentheses (i.e., (TM), (SM) or (R)).
Refer to the current listing of trademarks below.
3. Make it clear that the trademark (and the product it is the name of, as applicable) is owned by Proper use example: New HAPS® hardware. . . .
Improper use example: New HAPS® hardware. . . .
4. Always use the complete and proper spelling of the trademark. Never use acronyms in place of the trademark and never hyphenate or abbreviate the trademark.
5. Do not incorporate or combine trademarks (including without limitation logos) into third party product names, service names, trademarks, logos, or other company names, nor adopt any logos or other marks that are similar to Synopsys’ trademarks.
6. Identify as the owner of the trademark, e.g., [Mark] is a trademark of Synopsys, Inc. in the and/or other countries.
7. Only use company and product logos as set forth in the applicable and any instructions provided by (including without limitation with respect to fonts, colors, orientation and position, sizes and other parameters). For example, the guidelines for the “Synopsys” logo are available at this URL:

Clearer guidance on what benefits employees may accept from third parties.
The above is only a summary of changes to the Code. Please refer to the full text of the Code.
The updated Code became effective in the and most other regions on April 30, 2018. Some jurisdictions have a later effective date for the amended Code consistent with local law requirements and procedures.
