About SNUG
About SNUG
Your Global Design Community Focused on Innovation
The Users Group (SNUG) was established in 1991 to provide users of design tools and technology with an open forum in which they could exchange ideas, discuss problems and explore solutions. Today, there are 13 conferences worldwide drawing nearly 10,000 tool users, representing more than 900 companies. 

                
                  At the heart of each event is a technical conference focusing on real-world design challenges and featuring peer-reviewed User papers, along with presentations from top technologists and industry experts. Although all conferences maintain a common technical focus, each program is designed with the specific needs of the local design community in mind.
              

                
                  Writing a paper provides an opportunity for you to showcase your unique design and experiences to an audience of your peers. All User papers and presentations are published in the Proceedings Library, with the top papers receiving special recognition, including cash awards, along with being featured on the and SolvNet® online support websites.
              

                
                  is the largest community of design engineers in the world. offers an unequalled opportunity for face-to-face interactions with your industry peers, executives and R&There is no better place to explore common challenges, network with colleagues and make new contacts.
