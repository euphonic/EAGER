We work side by side with group companies in a wide range of fields, from plant construction to product development, production and logistics. Ecology Management Co., Ltd., located next to the Iwaki Factory, has amassed a broad range of expertise and technologies regarding treatment and disposal of industrial waste, furthering measures to protect the global environment.
Expanding markets with exports and local production of the specialty products that meet global needs
product sales are steadily growing in overseas markets. Exports currently account for around 25% of total sales. Our business in advanced materials, food packaging materials, agrochemicals, and other specialty products is expanding worldwide.
Seeing growing needs and scope for opportunity in foreign markets, we are leveraging the synergies of the Group to further our business activities overseas. In summer 2014, our new polyvinylidene fluoride production plant will start up its operation in Changshu, China. This new facility will be part of a structure for stable supply, allowing us to quickly meet growing demand in Asia and around the world.English
