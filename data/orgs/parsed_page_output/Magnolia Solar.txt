Inc.Magnolia's Quest
is working in several directions to help drive the cost of power down to achieve parity with power delivered by the electricity grid. In pursuing this quest, we use revolutionary photovoltaic cell device designs and methods of manufacturing.
There are wide disparities in the consumption of electric power among the countries of the world. In the United States we consume about 12,900 kilo-Watt-hour (kWh) electricity per capita annually. In contrast, that number is about 2,175 kWh in China and about 465 kWh in India. As we pursue grid parity in photovoltaic technology, we seek to help provide electricity to the about two billion people in the world who do not have access to electric power at present with a viable alternative. Our quest is help reduce these wide disparities in electricity consumption.
We believe that as disparity in electricity consumption is reduced, increases in power consumption will help improve economic life for people who have no or limited access to electric power.
We seek to be a part of the many forces in the world that are working towards improving economic life in the developing parts of the world. We aim to help accomplish this goal while reducing dependence on fossil fuels and helping to reduce carbon emissions by providing a low-cost, high efficiency modular source of electric power that is at par with what the cost for electricity is in most of the developed world.
In addition to developing economically viable commercial products, is also seeking to develop cell products for military ground forces, avionics and space systems.

By one estimate, some two billion people at present have no access to electricity. Our vision is to deploy power everywhere, since many of those without electricity are not connected to the power grid. Of all the sources of electricity, power is the
only modularly scalable power source. Traditional sources of electricity such as hydro, coal, nuclear, and natural gas require setting up a plant that connects to the supply grid. Even wind energy farms have to be centralized to generate several hundred megawatt power to be cost effective. In comparison, power can be an effective source of electricity for projects that require from a few kilowatts electricity to several hundred megawatt power. The scalability of the electric power makes it the unique technology to deploy wherever there is no grid or when large electricity generation is needed to supplement output of a power plant to meet electricity requirements during the peak demand hours.
plans to become a major supplier of power by serving both commercial and defense market. By supplying high efficiency, low cost panels, we expect development of applications that will help sustain life in areas with no grid. There are several applications that can benefit this decentralized power market. These applications include power to extend hours of economic activity, access to telecommunications, preservation of medical supplies, and improvement in night-time security. For the defense markets, is developing its technology of flexible substrates so that the power modules can be packed and stowed when not in use. Our vision is to provide a portable source for our soldiers to recharge batteries for electronic gear while on filed missions away from a base.
is developing its technology in the New York's Capital Region and plans to establish its first manufacturing facilities in this area to create high-paying technical jobs in the United States. Based on recent developments in the photovoltaic market, while many silicon crystal technology based manufacturers have moved overseas to use cheap labor, companies using thin-film technologies have continued to sustain operations in the By adding high value in its product, expects that it will create high paying jobs in the while competing effectively with foreign manufacturers.
Many state governments or agencies have established aggressive goals to use renewable energy to meet a portion of their electricity requirement. For example, New York has established an aggressive goal commonly referred to as 30x15, which aims to acquire 30 percent of its electricity requirements from renewable sources. By providing a domestic source of cost-effective power, Magnolia's vision is to help state and federal governments meet their targets of renewable energy deployment while creating high-paying jobs in the United States.

Magnolia's transformational approach to thin film cells is based upon breakthrough discoveries in nanostructured cell designs and optical coatings engineering.
has developed anti-reflective coatings that are far superior to what is being used in the industry today. Most cells suffer from a reduction of efficiency due to reflection of some of the incident sun light away from the cell. The energy in the reflected light is not converted to electric power and the loss of this power affects the efficiency of the cell. Our anti-reflection technology reduces the loss of power due to reflection of negligible levels, thereby allowing more sun light to be absorbed for a higher efficiency.
The engineering employed in our technology is designed to increase the photovoltaic operating voltage while capturing a larger part of the spectrum,
and the unique nanostructure-based optical coatings to minimize reflection losses which enhances the light trapping within the photovoltaic devices. Our design uses nanostructure to horizontally scatter light that enters the cell to substantially increase the travel path of the light. This innovation addresses another shortcoming of the traditional cells where the travel path, particularly in thin-film cells, is small and therefore all the energy that enters the cell is not converted to electric power.
With this approach, is aiming to dramatically enhance the power-generating capability of photovoltaic systems by developing low cost, thin film technology that delivers unprecedented levels of electrical energy per unit area. has filed several patent applications for its revolutionary photovoltaic cell device designs and methods of manufacturing.  The technologies related to these patent filings address the fundamental performance limitations in existing thin film cells. These technologies result in higher electric conversion efficiency by increasing both the voltage and current output of thin film cells

Solar, Inc. technology is looking into unconventional cell designs. The new design is achieved by the use of our vast experience in nanotechnology.       Historically, crystalline silicon (c-Si) has been used as the light-absorbing semiconductor in most cells, even though it is a relatively poor absorber of light and requires a considerable thickness (several hundred microns) of material. Nevertheless, it has proved convenient because it yields stable cells with good efficiencies (11-16%, half to two-thirds of the theoretical maximum) and uses process technology developed from the huge knowledge base of the microelectronics industry.

Technology Notes"Magnolia's" innovation enhances quantum effects in nanostructures for higher efficiency cells.
Current power technology has little chance to compete with fossil fuels or large electric grids. Today's cells are simply not efficient enough and are currently too expensive to manufacture for large-scale electricity generation. However, potential advancements in nanotechnology may open the door to the production of cheaper and more efficient cells.
Photovoltaics is the diode action in a cell for generating electricity from light and today it is fast becoming an important product to meet the goals of green revolution. Presently the cell market is dominated by wafer based crystalline Si cells. Unfortunately, single crystal cells are very costly. Further these cells are simply not efficient enough and are currently difficult and expensive for large-scale electricity generation. Attempts are being made to reduce the cost by using thinner thin-film process with higher conversion efficiency. In the course of developing thin-film technology researchers have stumbled upon the opportunity of using nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is expected to will play an important role in the future to increase efficiency and significantly lower cost.
Nanotechnology is considered as the key for materials innovation and technological progress in almost all branches of engineering. Nanotechnology offers the long desired cross-cutting technologies that hold the secrets for decisive technological breakthroughs in the energy sector, particularly for cells, thus making significant contributions to sustainable energy supply towards the green revolution.
Nanotechnology applications have demonstrated surprising results in many fields of medicine and electronics by showing cost-effective and efficient technology solutions. research shows the most promising and cost effective solutions towards the development of very high efficiency cells.
