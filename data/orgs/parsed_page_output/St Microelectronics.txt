SThas a long history and demonstrated expertise in sensors and actuators. As the first major manufacturer to start high-volume production on 200mm wafers in 2006, launched the consumer revolution by making motion sensors small, accurate, and affordable through the combination of innovative product design, deep application expertise, and industry-leading process and packaging technology.
Sthen has continued to grow and diversify its portfolio into new types of devices and application segments. Today, in addition to its successes in motion sensors for consumer markets, the company features products dedicated to automotive, industrial and medical markets with a dedicated manufacturing flow guaranteeing high quality and reliability.
In addition to using the well-understood and valuable electrical properties of silicon, (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) sensors leverage silicon’s unique mechanical properties to integrate mechanical structures able to sense acceleration, rotation, angular rate, vibration, displacement, heading, and other physical and environmental properties. manufactures its using proprietary micromachining processes that share processing steps derived from basic integrated circuit techniques. These steps produce a circuit that combines electrical circuits and 3-dimensional mechanical structures.
ST’s long-term success in has drawn upon the Company-developed, industry-leading Thick Epitaxial Layer for Micro-gyroscopes and Accelerometers (ThELMA) manufacturing process. This is a surface micro-machining process that combines variably thick and thin poly-silicon layers for structures and interconnections, enabling the integration of accelerometer and gyroscope mechanical elements in a single chip.
ST’s Thtechnology enables the creation of tiny mechanical structures that, in combination with our strong packaging expertise in creating high-vacuum cavity and controlling the hermetic sealing of the mechanical structure, assures high reliability and great performance while offering significant cost and size benefits to customers.
Recently, qualified and started the production of ThELMA60, an enhanced version of Thtechnology, implementing a 60μm surface-micromachining epitaxial layer, 3 times thicker than the standard Thprocess. This thicker layer brings the superior performance required by high-end inertial sensors, while keeping the cost effectiveness and flexibility of the Thtechnology. With this step is bridging the gap between surface-micromachining and bulk-micromachining traditionally used to manufacture high-end sensors.
An efficient integration
uses a dual-chip system-in-package approach assembling separate and dice in the same package.
is the world’s first manufacturer to have implemented innovative solutions such as Through-Silicon Via technology (TSV) in high-volume production. Deployed in volume production s2011, the ST-patented technology replaces traditional wiring with short vertical interconnects in ST’s multi-chip devices, such as smart sensors and multi-axis inertial modules.

The broadband data boom and associated evolving telecommunication standards are calling for high-performing devices with ever increasing circuit complexity. New high data-rate services are driving the use of higher operating frequencies on optical and wireless systems, while requiring greater chip integration, reduced power consumption and optimized costs.
New Microwave applications such as Automotive Radars (24/77GHz), Satellite Communications, transceivers (60GHz), Point-to-Point radio (V-Band/E-Band), Defense, Security or Instrumentation are also extremely demanding of performance and operating conditions.
To support this demand, is investing aggressively in Bitechnology that provides the optimal answer for those needs.
BiCMOS: the best of two worlds
Bicombines the strengths of two different process technologies into a single chip: Bipolar transistors offer high speed and gain, which are critical for high-frequency analog sections, whereas technology excels for constructing simple, low-power logic gates.
By integrating the RF, analog and digital parts on a single chip, ST’s BiSiGe (Silicon-Germanium) technology drastically reduces the number of external components while optimizing power consumption.
ST’s Biprocess technology today offers a level of performance attainable in the recent past only with more expensive technologies such as gallium arsenide (GaAS), while providing a significant advantage in integration.
Compared to bulk CMOS, the BiHeterojunction Bipolar Transistor (HBT) allows a much higher cut-off frequency at a given technology node. To reach similar frequency, bulk designs have to use much smaller process nodes, forcing compromises on the design and leading most of the time to overall lower performance and higher coThus, thanks to its better cost profile compared to the alternatives, ST’s Bienables new business cases.

FD-SOI
FD-SOI
Over the past decades, transistors have been continuously scaled down in size to increase performance and reduce power consumption, leading to better electronics devices, able to do more useful, important, and valuable things faster, more clearly, and more efficiently; what the marketers call “an enhanced user experience.”
In recent years, as the transistor has shrunk to a size now below a few tens of nanometers, the effort has increased the challenges for every new generation of technology. One example is leakage current, which because transistors are so small, now represents a significant proportion of its power consumption.
In order to continue to deliver higher performance--while keeping the leakage under control--bulk-silicon transistors have become ever more complex, adding additional manufacturing steps and more recently considering a move to a new, expensive, 3architecture.
together with its partners, alternatively introduced new innovations in silicon process technology that incrementally leverage existing manufacturing approaches. Fully Depleted Silicon On Insulator, or FD-SOI, is a planar process technology that delivers the benefits of reduced silicon geometries while actually simplifying the manufacturing process.

VIPower™ is a technology developed by and in production s1991. Vertical Intelligent Power technologies provide control, protection and diagnostics for medium/high power automotive loads. The technology combines Vertical Double Diffused Power devices with their own temperature and current sensors and and components for Power-Analog-Mixed design.
In the latest configuration of the technology, TrenchPower Devices are integrated to provide a 35% reduction in the Ron resistance compared to the previous structures. 
wide range of Automotive Applications
In VIPower devices, as with standard discrete power MOSFETs, the substrate represents the common terminal (drain) of the multiple Power MOSFETs integrated into the chip. These are typically used as switches between the battery (or power source)  and the load. This makes the VIPower technology the perfect choice for the control of automotive exterior and interior lighting, motors for seat adjustment, door locks and window lifts, resistive heaters and any kind of power load that needs control and sensing as well as power.
The success of VIPower technology can be measured by the fact that on average, sells 40 VIPower devices per second!  Most of the devices go into car body applications. The latest generations are now setting a new standard for a wide range of high-current applications in automotive domain.  VIPower products are enabling the vehicle electrification and digitalization process, by replacing a host of electro-mechanical solutions, and providing lower power, lower chip count and lower pin-count solutions.
VIPower technology will play a  key role in the move towards electric vehicles. One of the first steps is the use of 48(in addition to the traditional 12V) distribution networks. Higher voltages provide higher power and efficiency whilst avoiding the need for the isolation/protection of higher voltage networks. These smart 48networks are used in Mild and Full Hybrid cars and require intelligent power switches to drive high- and low-sided loads and electric motors, with very low losses and high current sense accuracy, all monitored via the connections to the ECUs microcontroller.
Continuous Development
ST’s VIPower teams are constantly developing the technology to adapt to new applications and markets. In-house technology developers, designers, package designers, applications engineers and manufacturing ensure that the whole process and life-cycle of our VIPower products is managed to stringent quality standards.
Smart Tools and Selection
VIPower-is an application available for Android™ and iOS™ that provides  a complete view of the VIPower product portfolio on portable devices. You can easily find the device that best fits your application using the smart or the parametric search engine. Nominal voltage (12for automotive cars or 24for trucks), topology (high-side, low-side or h-bridge), number of channels and type of loads (bulbs, motors, etc.) and many more options can be specified to find the perfect VIPower product.
Twisteris a unique Electro-Thermal simulator that helps shorten the design solution cycle by performing, in a few clicks, complex engineering evaluations with accurate simulations like load-compatibility, wiring harness optimization, fault condition impact analysis, diagnostic behavior analysis and dynamic thermal performance.
ST’s Twisterthermal/electrical simulator, can be downloaded free of charge and supports a large selection of low/high-side driver/switches and h-bridges. It provides an easy way of testing and fine tuning the thermal, electrical and requirements to your design.

In cellular and Wi-Fi systems, the Radio Frequency (RF) Front-End Module is one of the most critical parts. Acting as an interface between the antenna and transceiver, the front-end module includes sensitive components such as an antenna Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) , power amplifiers (PA), antenna tuning switches, and a power management unit.
Ever increasing complexity
To meet design challenges such as isolating linear switches and maximizing the efficiency of power amplifiers, the industry developed specific processes for each part of the Front-End Module, leading to multiple discrete components and ICs.
As new high-speed standards, including 4mobile and Wi-Fi (802.11ac) use as many as 40 different frequency bands to increase data throughput, the latest networking equipment requires additional front-end circuitry, dramatically increasing the overall size from the conventional discrete approach.
This increased complexity requires new silicon-based processes that allow greater flexibility and better integration without compromising performance.
Towards more integration
Using its strong know-how in Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI), developed over a decade, STintroduced in 2008 a groundbreaking technology, called H9SOI, that then, perfectly met the requirements, while enabling a high-level of integration.
Available for customers developing compact integrated-Front-End modules, ST’s H9manufacturing process brought competitive solutions to replace the expensive conventional discrete approach.
H9FEM: solution for Front-End Modules
In 2012, building on that experience, further optimized its H9process and created a dedicated process called H9SOI_that enables customers to develop state-of-the-art fully-integrated Front-End-Modules.
The H9process is a highly competitive technology, allowing more compact front-end solutions while increasing performance versus the previous generation. The new process is built on dual-gate 0.13µm and 0.25µm MOSFETs and supports multiple devices, such as 1.2MOS, 2.5and optimized NLDMOS(1), in order to address all Front-End Module applications (Switches, Antenna Tuning, Power Amplifier and Low-Noise Amplifier).
H9benefits on performance
ST’s offers an excellent Ron.Cofffigure-of-merit for the antenna switch and antenna-tuning devices, bringing great performance while maintaining a robust isolation and high breakdown voltage.
Coff: Off-state Capacitance.
The optimized NLDMOS, combined with a thick copper layer, allows highly-efficient Power Added Efficiency (PAE) and gain for Power Amplifiers, with as much as a 10% improvement versus conventional solutions.
Finally, the H9SOI_process enables very-high-performance LNAs, capable of sustaining an outstanding ultra-low noise figure (0.2 dfor GO1 NMOS) with a threshold frequency that permits 5GHz designs with a safety margin.
H9manufacturing benefits
With H9FEM, has simplified the process flow, including reducing the number of masks. Fewer masks and fewer process steps has cut the overall lead time by 25% compared to the previous generation. Combined with ST’s manufacturing capacity, the new process ensures the best time-to-market for even the most demanding of customers

Galvanic Isolated High-Side Smart Power Switch with from STStands Out with Rich Diagnostic, Safety, and Protection Features
ISO8200AQ
 galvanic isolated octal high-side smart power switch enhances diagnostics and system management by providing a 20 MHz port allowing both per-channel over-temperature signalization and efficient daisy-chaining of multiple devices. power-good output indicates the status of the process-side power supply.

        
        	
        		
The device enlarges ST’s family of galvanic isolated high-side switches, featuring maximum safety and robustness in demanding applications such as industrial PLCs, PCs, or peripherals, and numeric-control machines in conventional factory automation or Industry 4.0 smart-factory scenarios.
The 2500Vrms built-in galvanic isolation assures superior safety and allows saving space in the final application and additional use for general-purpose isolation. By providing an port with support for daisy chaining, the ISO8200also allows one host to control multiple switches efficiently.
The power-good output alerts the control system in case the supply rail falls below a preset safe minimum threshold voltage, and complements the fault output pin that indicates communication errors or over-temperature conditions.
With eight channels, each having on-resistance of 0.12Ω (typical) and maximum current rating of 0.7A, the ISO8200manages all kinds of resistive, inductive, or capacitive loads with minimal power loss or heat dissipation.
Built-in protection features of the ISO8200further enhance safety, including short-circuit, channel over-temperature, case over-temperature, and loss of ground or supply protection. There is also under-voltage shut-down with auto-restart and hysteresis, overvoltage protection by Vcc clamping, and control of the output voltage to prevent damage due to switch off of inductive loads. In addition, the ISO8200satisfies the requirements for 61131-2 relating to functional properties and characteristics of programmable controllers.
An extensive ecosystem of support tools helps users get the best performance from the ISO8200These include the X-NUCLEO-OUT02A1 demonstration board, which simplifies evaluating and fine-tuning the setup, and the STSW-graphical user interface that helps visualize the device behavior. The X-NUCLEO-OUT02A1 takes advantage of the IC’s internal galvanic isolation between logic and power stages, and adds reverse-polarity protection and precautions meeting IEC61000-4-2, IEC61000-4-4 and IEC61000-4-5, to satisfy industrial safety standards.
The ISO8200is available now in 9mm x 11mm 32-pin TFQFPN32, priced from $3.125 for orders of 1000 pieces.

        Setting up STM32* microcontroller (MCU) projects is more intuitive and efficient using STMicroelectronics’ latest release of the STM32Cubeconfiguration tool. With its modern multi-panel that lets users visualize and do more without changing screen view, 
STM32Cubev.5.0
STM32Cubekick-starts embedded projects by helping users to select the right STM32 device from the family of over 800 variants and configure the basic hardware features appropriately, before automatically generating the MCU-initialization code.
Users can take advantage of powerful device-configuration utilities, including a pinout selector with conflict solver, help with clock-tree settings, and a power-consumption calculator for accurate early-stage assessment of energy requirements and power-saving opportunities. There are also tools for configuring peripherals and middleware stacks, such as TCP/or stacks, and support for dynamic validation of parameter constraints.
When configuration is complete, STM32Cubegenerates initialization code that is recognized by numerous popular development environments including 
IAR-EWARM
, 
Keil MDK-ARM
, 
AC6-SystemWorkbench
 for STM32, or independent (Compiler Collection) toolchain projects.
STM32Cubecomes as standalone software ready to run on major desktop operating systems or through the Eclipse plugin. It can be downloaded for free, together with other STM32Cube software including dedicated 
Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL
)
 middleware and code samples, from

Artificial Intelligence (AI) can be defined as a machine’s ability to perform logical analysis, acquire knowledge and adapt to an environment that varies over time or in a given context.
is already being used in many different applications today, such as:
Super-smart computing-intensive AIs that help doctors make diagnoses by sifting through terabytes of patient data points to offer the best advice;
Self-driving cars, autonomous cars that understand everything about traffic and help to keep drivers and other road users safe while making the journey more efficient;
Chatbots, often indistinguishable from human operators, able to answer complex questions in real time;
Online shopping experiences that are tailored to individual preferences;
Personal voice assistants that are rapidly becoming pervasive to simplify everyday life.
This is only the beginning. The Internet of Things (IoT) is enabling tens of billions of intelligent connected devices that will make our lives easier and make the environments in which we live and work safer and more efficient, often by providing more natural human-machine communication. The addition of capabilities to these Smart Things will significantly enhance their functionality and usefulness, especially when the full power of these networked devices is harnessed – a trend that is often called on the Edge.
Artificial Intelligence & Deep Learning
uses an assembly of nature-inspired computational methods to address complex real-world problems where mathematical or traditional modeling have proven ineffective.  Examples include a process that is too complex for analytical modeling or when a process contains some unknowns due to its intrinsic dynamic behavior. Many real-life problems cannot be described in exact terms and fall into this category, so they cannot be processed by traditional computing systems.
Artificial Intelligence uses an approximation of the way the human brain reasons, using inexact and incomplete knowledge to produce decisions and actions in an adaptive way, with experience built up over time.
The basic concepts behind have been around sthe 1950’s but modern programming techniques (such as python), the availability of huge quantities of data, open-source tools for neural-network training, powerful computing centers and ever-improving embedded-processing systems are contributing to taking off as a world-changing technology today.
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence and refers to techniques which enable machines to recognize underlying patterns and learn to make predictions and recommendations by analyzing data and experiences, rather than through traditional explicit programming instructions. adapts using new data and experiences to improve prediction performance over time.
Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of machine learning. It aims to learn data patterns and dependencies by using a hierarchy of multiple layers that mimics the neuron connections of the human brain and make up any deep neural network. Deep Learning techniques work with very large datasets by analysing data, recognizing patterns and making predictions on next data points.
Before the advent of deep-learning techniques, creating and testing algorithms to solve some problems required detailed subject expertise and writing and debugging dedicated, hand-crafted, and often very complicated programs. 
With Deep Learning, a computer can train itself with a large set of data collected for this purpose. The learning stage, in which the neural network learns to classify different patterns, may use data-sets labelled in advance, a process referred to as Supervised Learning. In the case of unlabeled data-sets the learning process is called Unsupervised Learning and during the training the neural network tries to cluster the data-set into groups with similar patterns.
In both cases the result is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that contains all the information necessary to carry out the task. The uses the knowledge acquired in the training to infer data features from new incoming data. This is called Inference stage and can be deployed in embedded devices with memory and processing capabilities orders of magnitude smaller than the servers used to train the itself.
on the Edge
Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are available in various types, topologies, and complexities to address a variety of problems across a wide spectrum of applications. They can exploit the data provided by the exploding number of heterogeneous sensors present in our homes, offices, cars, factories, and personal items.
If we consider a model where the raw data from all these sensors are sent to a powerful central remote intelligence, then we quickly see the escalation in required data bandwidth and computational capabilities in the Cloud.  Especially if you consider processing audio, video or images from millions of end devices, not to mention the potential latency generated by such a centralized system.
enables much more efficient end-to-end solutions by switching from a centralized to a distributed intelligence system, where some of the analysis done in the cloud is moved closer to the sensing and actions. This distributed approach significantly reduces both the required bandwidth for data transfer and the processing capabilities of cloud servers. It also offers data privacy advantages, as personal source data is pre-analyzed and provided to service providers with a higher level of interpretation.
Moreover, depending on the complexity of the task, solutions can offer various complexity levels, including numbers of operations per inference run and memory requirements, the input data rate, real-time processing requirement and allowable latency.
So and Deep Learning allow pure or mixed SW/low-power solutions to be deployed close to the sensor, enabling true edge computing.
has been engaged in research and development for several years. As a leading supplier of high volume, broad-market, embedded-processing solutions we are focused on developing scalable, flexible products and technologies to allow approaches to benefit a wide variety of devices, supporting a virtually unlimited number of use cases.
on STM32 Microcontrollers
In the future, nearly any device with a 32-bit microcontroller will be able to use techniques. More concretely they will be able to run (Deep Neural Networks) that have been trained to do specific tasks.
While most microcontrollers today do not have the memory and processing power to run the learning algorithms needed to create DNNs, they can run the DNNs themselves – provided that the networks are optimized for microcontrollers.
has created a tool called the STM32Cube.  to do that optimizing of DNNs for a  microcontroller .
The tool takes the pre-trained neural network model output from a broad range of the most popular frameworks (including Caffe, CNTK, Keras, Lasagne, TensorFlow, and theano), and maps it to an optimized that is adapted to the memory and processing-power capabilities of a target STM32 microcontroller.
The tool can also check the functionality of the adapted – which can be 10x smaller than the original, with negligible loss of accuracy.
has developed an advanced System-on-Chip demonstrator that allows ultra-energy-efficient processing. It addresses the challenging requirements of image, video, and natural language processing in data rate and real-time processing performance. The demonstrator combines 8 convolutional accelerators, 8 dual-clusters, and an optimized distributed-memory architecture in a 28nm FD-System on Chip.
