Both Team Motorsports Racecars Complete the 46th Zurich 24h-Race Nurburgring
The Group is pleased to announce that both of the Team Motorsports racecars competing in the 46th Zurich 24h-Race Nurburgring (commonly known as the 24h-Race Nurburgring) completed the race, with the team's Porsche 911 GT3placing 9th overall and the team's M6 GT3 placing 15th overall. Widely renowned as one of the world's largest touring car races, this year's 24h-Race Nurburgring was held from Thursday, May 10 through Sunday, May 13 in Nurburg, Germany.
After the qualifying heats, the Motorsports Porsche 911 GT3started the main race in 2nd place, while the team's M6 GT3 started out in 21st place. This year's race was marked by dramatically shifting conditions-night brought rain, which gave way to thick fog toward the end that temporarily put the race on hold. Nevertheless, our tires rose to the occasion, demonstrating high performance all around and especially in terms of endurance and wet/dry grip performance. As a result, Team Motorsports' Porsche 911 GT3finished 9th overall while the team's M6 GT3 came in 15th overall. In a race considered to be a true challenge just to finish, both of the Team Motorsports racecars were able to complete the race thanks to our high-performance tires.
