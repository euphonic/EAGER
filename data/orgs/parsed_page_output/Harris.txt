In 2017, a group of #HarrisCorp employees created a new oyster bagging machine which slashed the time it takes to fill individual bags with oyster shells.
This weekend, more employees used that same machine to complete 741 shell bags, exceeding their goal of 700.
These efforts help to restore and preserve the Indian River Lagoon. Oysters, which used to be plentiful but now have small naturally occurring populations, are excellent for the lagoon because their filter feeding cleans the water.
Great work, team!

The Story
Innovation has been the cornerstone of Harris’ success since its founding more than 125 years ago – and it remains the driving force behind everything we do. From its printing-press roots, has transformed itself into a leading technology innovator, solving customers’ toughest mission-critical challenges by providing solutions that connect, inform and protect. The company today provides a wide range of differentiated technologies to support government and commercial customers in more than 100 countries, and has more than $6 billion in annual revenue.

Fact Sheet
The Early Days
Harris’ innovative spirit was spawned out of necessity by two entrepreneurs whose first invention – a faster printing press – launched the Automatic Press Company.
The company went on to create many new innovations, merged with two other printing equipment companies, and by midcentury emerged as one of the world's largest printing equipment manufacturers.
Into the Space Age
As the Space era arrived, began transforming into an electronic communications company with the acquisition of Radiation Inc., a premier developer of miniaturized electronic tracking and pulse code technologies for America's fledgling space program. The nation's earliest communication and weather satellites, military missile systems, manned space flights and Apollo moon missions all relied on Radiation technologies to complete their missions.
In the 1970’s, the renamed moved its headquarters to Melbourne, Florida. And by the turn of the century, had celebrated its centennial and completed its transition from a printing company into a global communications and information technology company.
In 2015, continued its transformation by acquiring Exelis Inc., creating a company with greater scale, capabilities, and core franchises focused primarily on and international government markets where the company provides differentiated technologies.
“Continually pushing the boundaries of technology through innovation has always been an essential part of Harris’ culture.”
