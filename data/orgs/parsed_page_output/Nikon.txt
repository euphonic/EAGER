UNIVERSCALE
From the nanoworld to the universe 
— The worlds we measure using our infinite yardstick.
Enter 
Nikon's opto-electronics technologies let people explore realms beyond the range of the naked eye.
Today's electron microscopes and astronomical telescopes reveal objects that were invisible to people of the past. How is your grasp of the sizes of such things?
Universcale lets you see and understand the relative size of the full range of known objects in our universe. You can see the relative sizes of objects arranged on a single scale, and grasp the sizes of things that you cannot compare side by side in the real world.
