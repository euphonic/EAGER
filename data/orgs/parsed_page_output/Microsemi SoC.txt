Best-in-class security and exceptional reliability
Why Power over Ethernet?
Delivering Power over Ethernet (PoE) reduces the cost of installation and maintenance of devices in remote locations (e.g. Access Points and Cameras), and enables providing centralized power backup to devices without the need to re-wire the infrastructure.
802.3 Power over Ethernet 
The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, or IEEE™ 802.3 Ethernet Working Group has been working on standardizing the delivery of power over Ethernet (PoE) cables since 1999. has been involved since then in PoE, having participated in the first and second PoCalls for Interest in the 802.3 Working Group, and since then in the standardization of 802.3af-2003, 802.3at-2009, and in the 803.bt Task Force. The 802.3bt standardization work started in 2013 and ratification is expected in early 2018.
802.3 defined the following types of devices:
Powered Device (PD): The consumer of power over Ethernet. makes PoICs to receive power, Ideal Diode Bridges to minimize power losses on polarity rectification, and also Posplitters , used to power non-Podevices over Ethernet.
Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE): Sends power over Ethernet, and can be of two types:
Endspan PSE, or PoSwitch: PoIntegrated inside the Ethernet Switch. has a very broad line of PoICs . also makes Outdoor PoSwitches and indoor Poextenders .
Midspan PSE, or PoInjector: Unit placed between a non-PoEthernet Switch and the Powered Device. has a large family of indoor and outdoor PoMidspans .
Utilization of 802.3-compliant equipment for power delivery over Ethernet cables is critical, as adhering to the standard ensures:
Equipment Safety: Power over Ethernet ensures safe delivery of power to PoPowerable Devices (PD), without damaging non-compliant devices, and without damaging the cabling infrastructure already in place
People Safety: Pooperates in voltages below 60V, and the Podetection classification mechanisms performed by the Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE)
Data Integrity: Power delivery over Ethernet cables does not cause data degradation or loss of data integrity, as long as the maximum number of energized cables in a bundle is respected, per 802.3 guidelines.
Power over HDBaseT
The HDBaseAlliance standardizes the HDBaseprotocol, which allows extending links up to 100 m over Category 5(CAT5E) or better cables. In 2011, the HDBaseAlliance created the Power over HDBase(PoH) standard, which is backwards compatible with PoE, and extends the maximum power deliverable to 95W.
Energy Efficient Po(EEPoE)
Microsemi's exclusive EEPotechnology cuts the power losses on Ethernet cables by 50%, through the utilization of all the copper available on cable when a EEPoor Midspan is used. It is 100% compatible with IEEE802.3at, and the savings work with 802.3at Type 2, Type 1 or 802.3af compliant In practice, devices that consume 25.5would consume less than 27.75W, instead of the worst case 30when a non-EEPois employed.

Terminology
IEEE802.3af-2003 - Original Power over Ethernet (PoE) standard from July 2003. Allowed sending 15.4 of power with voltages between 44and 57and a maximum ongoing current of 350mfrom the Power Sourcing Equipment (PSE) to the Powered Device (PD).. Required Category 3 or better structured cabling, with worst case resistance of 20ohms over 100m. 12.95at a voltage range of 37to 57are available to the powered device, with the remaining15.4W-12.95W=2.45being potentially dissipated on the cable.
IEEE802.3at-2009 – Latest IEEE802.3 Postandard, also known as PoE+ or Poplus, allows delivery of up to 30or 60over a single Category 5 or better cable, depending on the number of pairs utilized to deliver power. IEEE802.3at-2009 powered devices can consume up to 12.95(type 1), 25.5(type 2) or 51(two collocated Type 2 interfaces).
Power over HDbase- Postandard, also known as PoH, allows delivery of up to 100w over a single Category 5e/6 Ethernet cable.
Po– Power over Ethernet, nomenclature of the multiple technologirs that allow delivery of power over Category 3 or better cables along with Ethernet data. Normally refers to the IEEE802.3af-2003 and IEEE802.3at-2009 standards, but can also refer to pre-standard equipment such as Microsemi's Power over LAN™ and Cisco’s Inline Power, EPoor UPoE.
- a device powered by a and thus consumes energy. Examples include wireless access points, Phones, and cameras.
Many powered devices have an auxiliary power connector for an optional, external, power supply. Depending on the design, some, none, or all power can be supplied from the auxiliary port, with the auxiliary port sometimes acting as backup power in case of Posupplied power failure.
– "Power Sourcing Equipment" - the device such that provides power on the Ethernet cable.
Midspan – intelligent power injectors that stand between a non-PoEthernet switch and the powered device, injecting power without affecting the data.
- "Wireless Local Area Network Access Points" are base stations for the wireless network. They transmit and receive radio frequencies for wireless enabled devices to communicate with.
Camera - "Internet protocol cameras" are a type of digital video camera which can send and receive data via a computer network and the Internet.
Vo- "Voice over Internet Protocol" is a family of technologies, methodologies, communication protocols, and transmission techniques for the delivery of voice communications and multimedia sessions over Internet Protocol (IP) networks.
Thin Client - a client machine that relies on the server to perform the data processing. This can be either a dedicated thin client terminal or a regular with thin client software is used to send keyboard and mouse input to the server and receive screen output in return.
Zero Client - a server-based computing model in which the end user's computing device has no local storage. zero client can be contrasted with a thin client, which retains the operating system and each device's specific configuration settings in flash memory.
Access Control Device – often referred to as a "reader," is a device that controls accessibility to a physical barrier where granting access can be electronically controlled.
– "Ultraviolet Light" This light wave can cause damaging burnt radiation, which is why Microsemi's  PD-9001GO-is protected to survive intensive environments.
- defines standards for various grades of electrical enclosures typically used in industrial applications. Each is rated to protect against designated environmental conditions. The  PD-9001GO-has the 4rating, which defines similar protection as the IP66 rating. For typical outdoor applications, where submersion is not a characteristic of installation, a 4enclosure will be the optimal choice.
