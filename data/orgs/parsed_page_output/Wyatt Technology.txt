         Find out the true story behind the development of the finest and most versatile laser light scattering instruments available, Technology's systems. Here you can trace the path of innovation and discovery in the field of light scattering from the middle of the 20th century to today's state-of-the-art instruments!
Brice Phoenix Universal Light Scattering Photometer
 was the first successful light scattering instrument. It used a mercury arc lamp as a light source and the sample was illuminated by placing it within a scattering cell in the light path. The cell sat on a stage and the detector could be revolved about this stage manually in order to attain light scattering measurements at varying angles. The detector consisted of a photomultiplier tube whose signal value was output to a galvanometer. The Brice Phoenix instrument was essential to early production of Zimm plots. This laboratory workhorse probably produced more Zimm plots in its time than any other instrument.
          	
Sofica
 instrument used a water cooled mercury vapor lamp as its light source. The measuring cell would be immersed in a liquid chosen to eliminate errors and simplify calculations, as well as providing efficient thermal control. The detector was a semi-automatic photomultiplier tube which could rotate through various angles.
          	
Differential I
 was the first commercially available light scattering instrument to incorporate a laser as its light source. detector was moved by a stepper motor through a 180° range, and the signal was output to a stepper driven X-chart or a strip chart. Produced by Science Spectrum, this instrument was primarily used in antibiotic testing. About 20 units in all were manufactured and sold.
          	
Differential 
Module was capable of levitating a single particle in the 100 to 4,000 nm range. The particle was levitated into the path of the laser beam by means of a quasi-static electric fields and could be maintained in this position for several days if needed. During the extended levitation period, time dependent physical phenomenon could be observed. The Differential Module was used to accurately measure liquid microdroplets and diverse viscous material.
          	

                  Beckman Instruments developed an instrument for low angle laser light scattering capable of measuring the light scattering signal as low as 3°. The narrow beam of the laser allowed angles this low to be measured for the very first time. Chromatix further developed this instrument which was  marketed as the 
KMX-6
 for use with chromatographic separation systems. Chromatix was later purchased by Milton Roy, which was, in turn, purchased by Thermo Instruments.
          	
Differential III
 also used a laser as a light source. An automated carousel moved cuvettes through the beam path. The first cuvette would contain the control and successive cuvettes, having the bacterial isolate in suspension with selected antibodies, would then rotate into the beam path and their scattering properties could be measured. Data was recorded to an on-board computer and outputted to a card punch. The Differential was the first scientific instrument to incorporate both a laser and an on-board computer.
          	
Chromatix KMX-16
 differential refractometer made use of a 0.5 mHeNe laser as its light source. This instrument was very useful as it had the ability to measure differential refractive index increments (
dn/dc
 values) by passing laser light through a sample and control solution. This instrument also provided increased temperature control. However complex optics and manual mechanical adjustment mechanisms proved to be problematic.
          	
Chromatix 100
 was a low angle light scattering instrument which made use of a HeNe laser as its light source. The instrument would detect light scattering signals between 5.1° and 6.1° using a fixed in place photomultiplier tube as the detector.
          	
F
 instrument ever manufactured was purchased by Johnson Wax. HeNe laser was used as the light source and the flow cell was located very near the laser aperture. The flow cell ran perpendicular to the direction of the laser and was surrounded by a total of eight detectors.
          	
F
 was sold to in 1984. It was the first instrument to have a flow through cell in which the direction of the flow is parallel to the beam direction. Like the DAWN-B, 15 separate photodiodes were housed in the read head to detect light scattering signals from the flowing solution. The flow cell, while similar in principle to our modern flow cells, differed greatly in appearance.
          	
DAWN-B
 (or DAWN-Batch) unit was an early model in the line. It housed 15 detectors which would simultaneously collect light scattering data scattered from a scintillation vial placed into the read head in the center of the array of detectors and the path of the HeNe laser.
          	
Optilab 902
 was developed and manufactured by the Tecator of Sweden. This differential refractive index detector was an essential partner to the series of instruments, as it was able to measure the 
dn/dc
 of a given solution at the same wavelength as the light scattering instrument. Knowing the 
dn/dc
 value is essential to the characterization of molar masses. The Tecator Optilab was purchased by and the instrument was further developed into the Optilab 903 model and ultimately into the Optilab DSP.
          	

                  developed this three angle version of the instrument. The use of a solid state laser allowed the footprint of laser light scattering instrumentation to be reduced greatly. The 
miniTriStar
 laser operates at 690 nm and the instrument is capable of measuring a molar mass range from a few hundred daltons to greater than one million daltons.  Molecular sizes may also be measured ranging from 10 to 50 nm.

is the recognized leader in light scattering instrumentation and software for determining the absolute molar mass, size, charge and interactions of macromolecules and nanoparticles in solution.
Wyatt's line of multi-angle static light scattering products couple to size exclusion chromatography (SEC-MALS), field-flow fractionation (FFF-MALS), and stop-flow composition-gradient systems (CG-MALS). Our dynamic light scattering (DLS) products operate in traditional cuvette as well as on-line and automated, high-throughput modes. We also offer unique instruments for electrophoretic light scattering (MP-PALS), differential refractometry, and differential viscosity.

About
Our History
The inventors of celebrate an early application of laser light scattering.
(WTC) is involved in the research and development of techniques, instrumentation and software for absolute macromolecular and nanoparticle characterization. Founded in 1982 by 
Dr. Philip , the company was formed around his patents, ideas and inventions in industrial, military, and medical domains and commercialized the first light scattering instrumentation using lasers. To date, has developed the following instruments: classical multi-angle light scattering detectors for determining absolute molecular weights and sizes of proteins, polymers, biopolymers and nanoparticles in solution, differential refractometers, differential viscometers, dynamic light scattering instruments, zeta potential instruments, composition-gradient apparatus, as well as field-flow fractionation separation systems and their software.
To a great extent, much of WTC's business began with the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts awarded to the firm for its outstanding technological prowess and potential. The contracts are administered by certain agencies of the Government who have set aside a fraction of their authorized R&funding for exclusive award to small businesses. The purpose of these highly competitive programs is to encourage scientific and technical innovation in areas deemed to be of national importance. The successful commercialization of products developed under these programs is one of the most important objectives of funding.
has been awarded contracts from the Army Bioengineering Medical Research & Development Laboratory to establish the feasibility of instrumentation for the detection of toxicants in drinking water within sixty minutes. Another contract was from the Army Armament, Munitions and Chemical Command to build an aerosol monitoring device for sub-micron particles. The potential applications for this instrument include real time identification of aerosol particles such as asbestos fibers and biological agents. Another major contract was awarded by the Office of Naval Research, to develop an 
in situ
 particle monitoring device for characterizing undersea environments and their particulate constituents.
By far, the company's commercial flagship instrument, the DAWN, has been the driving force of the company. With extensive emphasis placed on intellectual property and new, patentable developments, the and minisystems have been sold in increasing numbers for more than two decades. Instruments have been placed in thousands of laboratories throughout the world, making them the most widely-recognized light scattering products on earth. The utility of the instruments is underscored by the burgeoning bibliography of publications, most of which have appeared in refereed journals. The systems provide unique and powerful tools for many different areas of analytical chemistry, including quality control, process control, molecular weight and size determinations, and a host of other applications, which are all possible with these multi-angle light scattering detectors.
The detectors are used by the world's most prestigious universities and some of the largest corporations in the world including DuPont, Dow Chemical, IBM, GlaxoSmithKline, Procter & Gamble, Pfizer, Bayer, ExxonMobil and Merck. The company's applications have also involved sales to companies at the forefront of the bioarena including Amgen, Genentech, Biogen Idec, Genzyme, and MedImmune.
Overseas sales provide an important component of the company's growth. actively sells its products throughout Europe, South America and Asia, thereby ensuring the greatest possible visibility and strongest sales potential for these systems. powerful distribution network ensures excellent service and support worldwide, while strategic partnerships with the world's largest manufacturers ensure Wyatt's compatibility with industry-leading hardware.
Increasing marketing activities by WTC, both in the and abroad, has heightened universal awareness of the need for better analytical instruments. Scientific Advisory Board comprised of one member of the National Academy of Sciences and  a Nobel Laureate underscores the company's commitment to scientific excellence, as well as to worldwide acceptance of its products.
With direct sales and service facilities in Europe and the Eastern U.S., WTC's Santa Barbara headquarters contains over 30,000 square feet of modern electronics, optical prototype, machine shop, and laboratory facilities.

is the recognized leader in light scattering instrumentation and software for determining the absolute molar mass, size, charge and interactions of macromolecules and nanoparticles in solution.
Wyatt's line of multi-angle static light scattering products couple to size exclusion chromatography (SEC-MALS), field-flow fractionation (FFF-MALS), and stop-flow composition-gradient systems (CG-MALS). Our dynamic light scattering (DLS) products operate in traditional cuvette as well as on-line and automated, high-throughput modes. We also offer unique instruments for electrophoretic light scattering (MP-PALS), differential refractometry, and differential viscosity.

is the recognized leader in light scattering instrumentation and software for determining the absolute molar mass, size, charge and interactions of macromolecules and nanoparticles in solution.
Wyatt's line of multi-angle static light scattering products couple to size exclusion chromatography (SEC-MALS), field-flow fractionation (FFF-MALS), and stop-flow composition-gradient systems (CG-MALS). Our dynamic light scattering (DLS) products operate in traditional cuvette as well as on-line and automated, high-throughput modes. We also offer unique instruments for electrophoretic light scattering (MP-PALS), differential refractometry, and differential viscosity.

is the recognized leader in light scattering instrumentation and software for determining the absolute molar mass, size, charge and interactions of macromolecules and nanoparticles in solution.
Wyatt's line of multi-angle static light scattering products couple to size exclusion chromatography (SEC-MALS), field-flow fractionation (FFF-MALS), and stop-flow composition-gradient systems (CG-MALS). Our dynamic light scattering (DLS) products operate in traditional cuvette as well as on-line and automated, high-throughput modes. We also offer unique instruments for electrophoretic light scattering (MP-PALS), differential refractometry, and differential viscosity.

is the recognized leader in light scattering instrumentation and software for determining the absolute molar mass, size, charge and interactions of macromolecules and nanoparticles in solution.
Wyatt's line of multi-angle static light scattering products couple to size exclusion chromatography (SEC-MALS), field-flow fractionation (FFF-MALS), and stop-flow composition-gradient systems (CG-MALS). Our dynamic light scattering (DLS) products operate in traditional cuvette as well as on-line and automated, high-throughput modes. We also offer unique instruments for electrophoretic light scattering (MP-PALS), differential refractometry, and differential viscosity.

Steve Minne
Chief Officer
Dr. Stephen Minne, under the Leland Edwards fellowship, received a and a Ph.from Stanford University in 1994 and 1996 respectively. After graduating, Dr. Minne remained at Stanford University as a Consulting Professor. In 1998 he founded NanoDevices Inc., an innovator in atomic force microscopy probes, and  served as President until it was sold to Veeco Instruments (NASDAQ: VECO) in 2003. Following the acquisition, Dr. Minne became General Manager of the newly formed division – Veeco Probes. Also in 2003, Dr. Minne co-founded FirstNano Inc., a company dedicated to producing turnkey solutions for nanotube and nanowire research.  In 2005, FirstNano was sold to (AMEX: CVV). In 2010 Bruker acquired Veeco, and at Bruker, Dr. Minne served as Director of Emerging Market Development, Senior Director of Product Management, Vice President of Business Development, and finally General Manager for the Atomic Force and Fluorescence Microscopy Business Units. In 2016 he joined as their Chief Officer. He holds over 30 publications and 25 patents relating to scientific instrumentation.

Michelle Chen, Ph.D.
Vice President of Analytical Services
Dr. Michelle Chen graduated from the Chemical Engineering Department at Yale University, where she studied under the late Professor Csaba Horvath. Her doctoral work focused on the development of novel approaches for high speed and high efficiency of biopolymers. 

        Dr.  Chen joined in 1996. Since then, she has incorporated multi-angle light scattering and dynamic light scattering detection into the characterization of various synthetic and biological polymers with and field-flow fractionation.

        Dr. Chen oversees technical support for the sales team, new application development, and sample analysis services at the Application Lab. She teaches classes and helps manage the China Office. She also supervises the Quality Control group at Technology.

Team Executives
Geofrey Chief Executive Officer
Geofrey graduated from Yale University. At Yale, he was the Editor-in-Chief of an on-campus journal, captain of his college's soccer team, and full partner in an ongoing entrepreneurial venture for three years.

        He joined in 1983 as its second full-time employee. He has been with the company ever since, with the exception of two years during which he received his Master's degree at the Harvard Graduate School of Business.

        Geof is responsible for marketing and its coordination with sales. His extensive travel puts him in close contact with Wyatt's direct and dealer networks overseas. He also works closely with Wyatt's research scientists and the ways in which they interact with manufacturing.

is the recognized leader in light scattering instrumentation and software for determining the absolute molar mass, size, charge and interactions of macromolecules and nanoparticles in solution.
Wyatt's line of multi-angle static light scattering products couple to size exclusion chromatography (SEC-MALS), field-flow fractionation (FFF-MALS), and stop-flow composition-gradient systems (CG-MALS). Our dynamic light scattering (DLS) products operate in traditional cuvette as well as on-line and automated, high-throughput modes. We also offer unique instruments for electrophoretic light scattering (MP-PALS), differential refractometry, and differential viscosity.

Bob graduated from Tufts University with a in Electrical Engineering and earned a position in GE's Edison Engineering Development Program in the Aerospace Instruments Division, with assignments in the new product development group, engine monitoring system computers. Following his tenure at he consulted at the New Hampshire Small Business Development Center, authoring and analyzing business plans for a wide variety of businesses. He received an from the University of New Hampshire, and was a finalist in the Paul Holloway Jr. Prize for Entrepreneurship. Bob then joined and turned around a struggling start-up scientific instrumentation company in Charlottesville, – Protein Solutions, manufacturer of the DynaPro dynamic light scattering technology. Bob's lucky break was joining with its acquisition of Proterion Corporation, where he was of Product Management of the DynaPro, Aviv Circular Dichroism and Plasmon Waveguide Resonance spectroscopy instruments.

        Currently, Bob is responsible for the sales and support of the growing number of products and customers in the Mid-Atlantic Region. He thoroughly enjoys working on the frontier of new products and markets, introducing Wyatt's innovative technologies to the regional market, determining which instruments best match customer requirements, and ensuring complete customer satisfaction with all of Wyatt's products.

Lionel Rouzic
Lionel Rouzic is an Applications Engineer for France, Spain, Portugal, and Regional Manager for Spain and Portugal, responsible for customer support across the Southern part of France, Spain and Portugal. He received his Chemical Engineer diploma from the Ecole Nationale Supérieur de Chimie de Rennes in France, as well as a M.Sc. in Environmental Sciences from the University of Northern Iowa under the advisory of Professor Ed Brown, where his work focused on miniaturizing a method to test for the biodegradability of oil samples. After working with electronic noses, near infra-red spectrophotometer, and online particle sizing instrumentation in the USA, he returned to Europe as Sales Manager of Wave Biotech Europe (later bought by Healthcare). After a brief time helping a biotech start-up in San Sebastian, Spain, he joined France to provide technical and application support to customers in his territory as well as sales support when needed.

About
Team Regional Sales & Support
Thomas Scheuermann, Ph.D.
Thomas Scheuermann is the Senior Applications Scientist and Regional Manager for Technology, providing technical, application, and sales support for the Midwest. Thomas’ academic work concerned the structure, internal dynamics, and ligand binding properties of proteins, using biophysical tools such as spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, ITC, and light scattering. Highlights include structure determination of the chemotherapy drug metabolizing enzyme (mentors Michael Hodsdon and Elias Lolis, Yale University) and as a postdoctoral fellow (mentor Kevin Gardner, Southwestern Medical Center) identifying a druggable ligand binding site for the HIF-2a protein – a critical driver of some kidney and brain cancers. small molecule inhibitor identified in this project is under commercial development and is being evaluated in Phase Clinical trials.
These basic research efforts transitioned into application support roles with the Southwestern biophysics core facility and Healthcare, before joining the team in early 2018. Thomas strives to make the best match between technology, application, and scientist and enabling teams to better and more efficiently pursue their goals.

Careers
is the recognized leader in light scattering instrumentation and software for determining the absolute molar mass, size, charge and interactions of macromolecules and nanoparticles in solution.
Wyatt's line of multi-angle static light scattering products couple to size exclusion chromatography (SEC-MALS), field-flow fractionation (FFF-MALS), and stop-flow composition-gradient systems (CG-MALS). Our dynamic light scattering (DLS) products operate in traditional cuvette as well as on-line and automated, high-throughput modes. We also offer unique instruments for electrophoretic light scattering (MP-PALS), differential refractometry, and differential viscosity.
