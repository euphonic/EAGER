We are the only biopharmaceutical company to be led by physician-scientists for more than 30 years. We consistently demonstrate our commitment to scientific excellence by counting multiple Nobel Laureates and five members of the National Academy of Sciences among our leadership, as well as being one of the first companies to form a Science and Technology Committee as an integral component of its Board, a practice which has since become industry standard.
