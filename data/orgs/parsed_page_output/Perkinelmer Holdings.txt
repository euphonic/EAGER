News & Key Insights

                    The development of key performance indicators (KPIs), or a set of related and quantifiable metrics, are required to ensure high-level business objectives are met. Used as a critical yardstick to measure progress at multiple levels throughout the organization, KPIs help you monitor where your lab is today, where it is headed with leading indicators highlighted, and the progress along the way.

                    recent article in Chemical & Engineering News (June 4, 2018, pp 28-33) focused on activities in immuno-oncology, where biologic checkpoint inhibitors are being tested in combination with other immunotherapies: there are currently ca. 250 small molecule- and antibody-based immunotherapies in clinical studies, and > 1100 clinical trials in 2017 combined a checkpoint inhibitor with another treatment. 
                

                    We then attempted to ease their pain by exploring modern informatics tools and applications that guide them to rapidly and intelligently identify, locate, search, extract and organize tractable sets of relevant data (internal or external, structured or unstructured, small molecule or biologic) for detailed analysis and visualization.

Single-Cell ICP-Analysis: Quantifying the Metal Concentration of Unicellular Organisms at the Cellular Level

                This study uses single-cell inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and discusses the steps required for a successful single-cell ICP-analysis using a mammalian case study of the uptake of cisplatin into ovarian cancer cells and an ecotoxicological example of the uptake of dissolved and nanoparticulate gold into freshwater algae cells.

Mini mass specs are still looking for an audience

                Mass spectrometry is a go-to method for determining which molecules are in a sample. If security officers are faced with an unknown, possibly dangerous, substance, they don’t want to waste time sending samples to a lab and waiting for mass spec results, however. They’d rather be able to take a portable mass spec into the field to get answers quickly.

 2 dual Argon humidifier is for analyses dealing with high concentrations of dissolved solids on instruments using auxiliary gas. Includes gas line connector kit.
			

				Guarantees constant delivery pressure even when cylinder pressure varies. Two-stage regulator with brass body and stainless steel diaphragm. Maximum inlet pressure of 20,700 KPa. Supplied with CGA-540 adapter. Includes a Swagelok™ 1/4 in. to 1/8 in. fitting which is used to attach the regulator to the purge gas tubing. Approximate weight: 1.3 Kg. 
			

				offers both single- and dual-stage regulators. All regulators are supplied with standard fittings. We recommend that you consult your local gas supplier first to determine the proper tank regulator required. All regulators have an outlet shutoff valve and terminate in a 1/4 in. fitting with male threads.

			
 Thermal Analysis Gas Station for all Thermal Analyzers (controls up to four purge gases). For use with Pyris Series or 7 Series/software.
				

				Thermal Analysis Gas StationUse the Thermal Analysis Gas Station (TAGS), a gas selector accessory with all thermal analyzers. The is a very flexible accessory featuring full control of all gases used in thermal analysis. In addition to performing gas switching, the also fully controls the gas flow rate, independent of the type of gas, and detects rapid changes in pressure and empty cylinders.
			

				Included in the kit are a rotary blower with capacitor and hardware, a vent to be located above the instrument, and an adapter to permit connection of the blower and vent with suitable metal tubing. The adapter and vent are made of stainless steel sheets.

Hear their perspectives.
Meet past and present innovators.
THEN
: In the 1960’s, the Carling Brewing Company of Cleveland, Ohio used the new Perkin-Elmer atomic absorption spectrophotometer to discover that bottled beer was contaminated by miniscule fragments of copper from the brewing kettles.
NOW
: Today, Long Trail Brewing of Vermont uses the Clarus® SQ8 to help maintain high quality standards for its craft beers — refreshing solutions that continue to refresh even today.
THEN
: In the 1950’s, our aerial panoramic camera lenses were capable of recording the entire state of Pennsylvania in two flyovers, with resolution that enabled one to count the autos on the Penn Turnpike.
NOW
: PerkinElmer’s sophisticated imaging technology enables discoveries at a cellular level, advancing critical areas of science such as disease research and drug discovery.
THEN
: Perkin-Elmer pioneered computer-aided chemistry with the introduction of the first microprocessor-controlled infrared spectrophotometer in 1975.
NOW
: We are now market leaders in electronic laboratory notebooks (ELNs) and software, providing over two million scientists worldwide with these technologies which replace paper laboratory notebooks. We expanded upon our legacy in the marketplace by launching Elements, a cloud-based scientific collaboration tool, revolutionizing how students and researchers collect and share data.
More Than 80 Years of Innovation
long-time leader in the scientific community, has a rich history of innovation and making life better through major scientific industry-defining strides.

Cord Blood and Cord Tissue Banking
ViaCord offers cord blood and cord tissue banking to expecting parents. ViaCord has banked the cord blood for more than 350,000 newborns.
What is Cord Blood?
Cord blood is the blood within a newborn’s umbilical cord which contains valuable stem cells. Cord blood stem cells can be used to treat nearly 80 diseases today, including certain cancers and blood disorders.
Learn More
What is Cord Tissue?
Cord tissue is the tissue surrounding the umbilical vein and contains different types of stem cells than cord blood. Cord tissue cells are showing great potential in research for treatment of medical conditions affecting cartilage, muscle and nerve cells.
Learn More
How Cord Blood is Used?
Cord blood stem cells have been used in transplant medicine for nearly 30 years. Over the last few years a powerful and promising science has emerged called Regenerative Medicine. Areas of ongoing Regenerative Medicine Research Trials using cord blood stem cells include Autism and Cerebral Palsy.
