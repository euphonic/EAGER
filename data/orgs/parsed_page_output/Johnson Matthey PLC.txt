We encourage collaboration inside and out, sharing and embracing diverse viewpoints. We tackle problems together, put our ideas into practice and take pride in combining our contributions to create something better for and our customers.

Enhancing life
Sales

Our planet is a multifaceted and fast-changing place. With a growing and ageing population and a clear shift towards urban living, governments and consumers are increasingly concerned about air quality and people's health. And with supplies of natural resources under ever-increasing pressure, their sustainable use has never been higher on the agenda.
Against this backdrop, organisations want to know how they can improve the efficiency, effectiveness and sustainable impact of their products and services, while also delivering the best business results. That's where we come in.
With our world-class science and technology, we're tackling the world's big challenges one product at a time. Using what we know about chemistry and materials, we work collaboratively with our customers to develop tailored solutions to get the best possible outcomes for them. We also bring our manufacturing skills to navigate the challenges of scaling up from lab into commercial production. And because we know the pace of change never stops, we apply our science expertise to the next generation of products and services, preparing our customers for the challenges of tomorrow.

What our strategy delivers
Our strategy directs investment choices across the group so that our people can translate our world class science and technology as efficiently as possible to solve our customers’ complex problems and tackle major global challenges: the need for clean air, improved healthcare and the most efficient use of our planet’s natural resources.
Our strategy will deliver sustained growth and value creation through:
Investment in science and technology which accelerates growth and creates leadership
Serving customers in growing, high margin, technology driven markets, aligned to global challenges and delivered through our four sectors
Operating with a relentless focus on efficiency and excellence; maximising synergies and driving standard processes and ways of working where it makes sense to do so
Attracting and retaining the best people into a culture that is true to our vision and that breeds success
new sustainable business framework to support value creation
With our science, understanding and vision, we believe we have much to contribute to a more sustainable future.
In March 2017 we came to the end of our Sustainability 2017 programme. Sustainability 2017 laid the foundations for our new brand: inspiring science, enhancing life; and our vision for a cleaner, healthier world. Our refreshed business strategy has stemmed from these.
In developing the next phase of our sustainable business framework, we recognised that the world had moved on. External stakeholder expectations had increased, and customers and investors are now looking increasingly for evidence of sustainable practices. Regulation has also increased in our field. And in the bottom line savings of £142 million that we achieved during Sustainability 2017, we knew that a new framework would once again provide business benefits.
We also considered the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and identified six of the SDGs where we can make the biggest positive impact.
The outcome is a new sustainable business framework aligned to our brand, vision and strategy. Read more about how we're building a sustainable business .
How we create value
Knowhow and intellectual capital
JM’s competitive advantage is its science and technology. We use our industry-leading capabilities across our sectors. We own patents covering our science, technology and processes.
Financial
We invest for growth using equity from our shareholders, raised debt and cash flow delivered by our sectors.
Customer relationships
We draw on our deep relationships with customers to understand how best to apply our science to solve their problems.
Natural resources
We source raw materials responsibly and use them as efficiently as possible. We also recycle platinum group metals (pgms).
Manufacturing operations
We have a global network of manufacturing plants, application centres and laboratories.
People
Our 14,000 people bring the talent, expertise and innovative thinking needed to drive growth and efficiency in JM.
How we use it
Science
Our science has been established over many years. We invest in it and in our scientific talent. Our skill and knowledge is acknowledged across the scientific community and amongst customers.
We have a set of nine core science capabilities (see page 26) which we use across They provide us with fundamental insights about materials, their design and then the control of their activity through chemical and functional manipulation.
Our competitive advantage is in combining knowledge of the fundamental science with commercial and scalable solutions, potentially customised for each and every customer.
This combination enables us to outperform in our target markets, and creates high barriers to entry.
Our customers choose us because of our technology.
Customers
Our science directs where we play. We apply it in technology driven markets and generate high margins from it. This drives high returns.
Our customers are mostly other industrial companies, operating in the transport, energy, chemicals and healthcare segments.
We work closely with them to develop solutions which enable them to bring their products to market faster, improve the performance of their products and reduce their environmental impact.
We provide them with functional components that help them create more sustainable products and solutions. We also provide specialist services such as the refining and recycling of pgms and process technology used to design chemical plants.
Collaboration and strong relationships with our customers are crucial in providing a high quality tailored service. Together, we put our inspiring science to work to enhance life.
Operations
We continue to improve our global standards and systems to enable us to operate every aspect of our business efficiently: from strategy to supply chain, from innovation to IT.
Our global manufacturing operations create highly specified physical products for our customers.
We manufacture efficiently and responsibly to drive economic and environmental performance and have programmes in place to optimise our manufacturing assets.
We invest in our manufacturing capacity to meet customers’ future demand and have the ability to flex our cost base if our markets slow.
We demand high returns from our investments, with a target of at least 20%, which drives continued improvement in operational efficiency.
People
Everyone in plays their part in taking ideas from the lab to full scale commercial success.
We hire the best people with the right skills and support them in an innovative culture that encourages them to develop and grow.
We are driven by values which means we always keep each other safe, work with clear intentions and respect, and do the right thing for our people and our planet.
They are supporting us as we are evolving to take decisions more quickly, to be more open-minded to new possibilities, to share more and stay confident through times of uncertainty.
Our values provide the strong foundation from which we are creating a cleaner, healthier world.
Our people are motivated by working for a company that is ‘making a difference’ and this is an important differentiator in attracting and retaining the very best.

Our heritage
Our 200th anniversary celebrations
Into our third century
2017 marked the 200th anniversary of Matthey. Back in 1817 we opened our doors as assayers, testing the purity of precious metals, and the business quickly expanded thanks to the vision and determination of our founders.

Today, our science and research touches some of the most pressing challenges faced by our planet and its people. 
Our technologies are making the planet a cleaner, healthier place and improving people's lives across every continent.
Inspiring science since 1817
