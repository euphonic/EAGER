Inspiring science, enhancing life
As a global leader in sustainable technologies, we apply our cutting-edge science to create solutions with our customers that make a real difference to the world around us.
We’ve been leaders in our field for more than 200 years, applying unrivalled scientific expertise to enable cleaner air, improved health and the more efficient use of our planet's natural resources.
And our story doesn’t end there. Through continued investment in sound research and development, we’re tackling the world’s big challenges into our third century and beyond.
Cleaner air
Our catalysts stop around 20 million tonnes of pollutants in their tracks every year. In the automotive market, one in every three new cars carries an emission control catalyst from Toxic carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons go in to the catalyst, clean air comes out. And because we understand, at the atomic scale, the distribution of platinum, palladium and rhodium in our catalysts, we're able to minimise the amounts of precious metal required to do the job. 
Finding the remedy
Our chemistry helps relieve symptoms in millions of people each year. Active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) are the constituents of pills and other medications that do all the work, whether it's attacking cancer cells, regulating a heart beat or combating severe pain. And making them effectively always starts in the lab. develops processes for many important, life changing drugs. We employ highly complex chemistry to prepare molecules to very specific standards, then design advanced manufacturing methods to produce them at the scale that our pharmaceutical customers need.
Recycling rare elements
Platinum group metals (pgms), are a valuable natural resource, and their applications are numerous. You'll find them in autocatalysts, jewellery, electronics and even people's mouths, as fillings. The more pgms we can reuse, the less we need to take from the earth. So we've developed highly advanced processes for extracting and separating pgms from products - so advanced that we can recycle platinum and palladium, for example, to a purity of 99.999%.
Charging forward
Electrics vehicles are on their way, and we're developing advanced new materials for battery cells in hybrid and full electric cars. Cathodes are the key. We're engaged in the cutting-edge science needed to understand how different cathode materials can reduce the time a battery takes to charge, and extend the distance full charged electric vehicle can travel.

Our 200th anniversary celebrations
History book
Into our third century
2017 marked the 200th anniversary of Matthey. Back in 1817 we opened our doors as assayers, testing the purity of precious metals, and the business quickly expanded thanks to the vision and determination of our founders.

Today, our science and research touches some of the most pressing challenges faced by our planet and its people. 
Our technologies are making the planet a cleaner, healthier place and improving people's lives across every continent.

new sustainable business framework
With our science, understanding and vision, we believe we have much to contribute to a more sustainable future.
In March 2017 we came to the end of our Sustainability 2017 programme. Sustainability 2017 laid the foundations for our new brand: inspiring science, enhancing life; and our vision for a cleaner, healthier world. Our refreshed business strategy has stemmed from these.
In developing the next phase of our sustainable business framework, we recognised that the world had moved on. External stakeholder expectations had increased, and customers and investors are now looking increasingly for evidence of sustainable practices. Regulation has also increased in our field. And in the bottom line savings of £142 million that we achieved during Sustainability 2017, we knew that a new framework would once again provide business benefits.
We also considered the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and identified six of the SDGs where we can make the biggest positive impact.
The outcome is a new sustainable business framework aligned to our brand, vision and strategy. Read more about how we're building a sustainable business .
How we create value
Knowhow and intellectual capital
JM’s competitive advantage is its science and technology. We use our industry-leading capabilities across our sectors. We own patents covering our science, technology and processes.
Financial
We invest for growth using equity from our shareholders, raised debt and cash flow delivered by our sectors.

Our science has been established over many years. We invest in it and in our scientific talent. Our skill and knowledge is acknowledged across the scientific community and amongst customers.
We have a set of nine core science capabilities (see page 26) which we use across They provide us with fundamental insights about materials, their design and then the control of their activity through chemical and functional manipulation.
Our competitive advantage is in combining knowledge of the fundamental science with commercial and scalable solutions, potentially customised for each and every customer.
This combination enables us to outperform in our target markets, and creates high barriers to entry.
Our customers choose us because of our technology.
Customers
Our science directs where we play. We apply it in technology driven markets and generate high margins from it. This drives high returns.
Our customers are mostly other industrial companies, operating in the transport, energy, chemicals and healthcare segments.
We work closely with them to develop solutions which enable them to bring their products to market faster, improve the performance of their products and reduce their environmental impact.
We provide them with functional components that help them create more sustainable products and solutions. We also provide specialist services such as the refining and recycling of pgms and process technology used to design chemical plants.
Collaboration and strong relationships with our customers are crucial in providing a high quality tailored service. Together, we put our inspiring science to work to enhance life.
Operations
We continue to improve our global standards and systems to enable us to operate every aspect of our business efficiently: from strategy to supply chain, from innovation to IT.
Our global manufacturing operations create highly specified physical products for our customers.
We manufacture efficiently and responsibly to drive economic and environmental performance and have programmes in place to optimise our manufacturing assets.
We invest in our manufacturing capacity to meet customers’ future demand and have the ability to flex our cost base if our markets slow.
We demand high returns from our investments, with a target of at least 20%, which drives continued improvement in operational efficiency.
People
Everyone in plays their part in taking ideas from the lab to full scale commercial success.
We hire the best people with the right skills and support them in an innovative culture that encourages them to develop and grow.
We are driven by values which means we always keep each other safe, work with clear intentions and respect, and do the right thing for our people and our planet.
They are supporting us as we are evolving to take decisions more quickly, to be more open-minded to new possibilities, to share more and stay confident through times of uncertainty.
Our values provide the strong foundation from which we are creating a cleaner, healthier world.
