Total Integration
Our state-of–the-art semiconductor components coupled with an production line enables us to deliver performance with the fastest lead times at the most competitive cost.
Our entire facility is ISO9001:2008 registered. We have maintained this registration since 2011, and continue to adhere to the principles of constantly improving ourselves and our products.
We are a leading provider of fiber‑optic networking products. We serve four growing end-markets: internet data centers (Data Center), Cable Television Broadband (CATV), fiber-to-the-home (FTTH), and telecommunications. We design and manufacture a range of optical communications products employing our vertical integration strategy from laser chips, components, subassemblies and modules to complete turn-key equipment. We design, manufacture and integrate our own analog and digital lasers using a proprietary Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) fabrication process, which we believe is unique in our industry. The lasers we manufacture are proven to be reliable over time and highly tolerant of changes in temperature and humidity (delivering millions of hours service), making them well-suited to the and markets where networking equipment is often installed outdoors.
All three of our end markets are driven by bandwidth demand fueled by the growth of network‑connected devices, that included video traffic, cloud computing and online social networking. To address this increased bandwidth demand, and telecommunications service providers are competing directly against each other by providing bundles of voice, video and data services to their subscribers and investing to enhance the capacity, reliability and capability of their networks. The trend of rising bandwidth consumption also impacts the internet data center market, as reflected in the shift to higher speed server connections. As a result of these trends, fiber‑optic networking technology is becoming essential in all four of our target markets, as it is often the only economic way to deliver the desired bandwidth.

The market is our largest and most established market, for which we supply a broad array of products including lasers, transmitters and turn-key equipment. In 2012, we were the leading provider of optical components and the second largest provider of subsystems to the industry, according to research firm Ovum Limited, or Ovum. Sales of headend, node and distribution equipment have contributed significantly to our growth in recent years as a result of our ability to meet the needs of equipment vendors who have begun to outsource both the design and manufacture of this equipment. While equipment vendors have relied upon third parties to assemble portions of their products, within the past four years certain of our customers have accelerated the outsourcing of both the design and manufacturing of both headend equipment and node equipment to third parties. The shift is due in part to the sophisticated engineering expertise needed to perform this work. We believe that our extensive high-speed optical, mixed‑signal semiconductor and mechanical engineering capabilities position us well to benefit from these industry dynamics.

The market generally refers to the Passive Optical Networks, or PONs, that telecommunications service providers are deploying. PONs take their name from the use of passive splitters to divide the optical signal provided to each residential user over a shared fiber-optic cable from a service provider’s central office. The equipment in the service provider’s central office is called an optical line terminal, or OLT, and the equipment at the end user is an optical network unit, or supports significantly greater bandwidth than does the legacy copper wire network, although the connection speed to a user (the “downstream” speed) is higher than the connection speed from the user (the “upstream” speed). In the U.S., Verizon’s service and AT&T’s uVerse offering are examples of deployments, and PONs have been widely deployed in Japan, Korea and selected cities in Europe as well. According to a 2013 Infonetics report, worldwide subscribers are expected to grow from 57 million in 2012 to 149 million in 2017, representing a of 21%, with the growth of higher speed connections among those subscribers being greater than the overall growth of connectivity.
Over time, the technology used in PONs has evolved to meet the increased bandwidth demand from users. At present, the most commonly deployed technology is GPON, or Gigabit PON, which delivers up to 2.5 gigabits per second of data downstream, split among subscribers, and 1.5 gigabits per second upstream. Due to the splitting of the bandwidth among multiple users—often as many as 32—the actual bandwidth delivered to an individual subscriber is far less than the 2.5 gigabits per second supported by the equipment. To deliver more bandwidth to a subscriber, a service provider can reduce the split ratio or change the technology. Reducing the number of subscribers supported by a single may be less expensive for modest, incremental upgrades, but may not be the most economical solution to deliver the significant increases in bandwidth needed to support 1 gigabit per second service to the home, as encouraged by the FCC’s Gigabit Challenge.
One approach that does support 1 gigabit per second service to the home connection is WDM-PON, or wavelength division multiplexing Well-proven in other areas of the network for decades, technology enables the transmission of multiple wavelengths of data over a single fiber-optic strand, thus significantly increasing the bandwidth of the physical fiber connection. Due to this significant increase in bandwidth supported with WDM-PON, the cost per bit delivered to a subscriber is lower than that for GPON—at faster connection speeds. In addition to providing more bandwidth, WDM-offers a subscriber superior privacy and the service provider better scalability because each subscriber has a dedicated wavelength rather than a shared one.

Conflict Minerals Policy Statement
Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) enacted in July 2010 imposes certain reporting obligations on Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) registrants whose manufactured products contain conflict minerals which are necessary to the functionality or production of their products. Conflict Minerals are defined as tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold that originates from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or an adjoining country.
As directed by the Dodd-Frank Act, the has adopted rules requiring publicly traded companies to disclose whether they use tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten that originated in the or an adjoining country and if so, to issue a report identifying their products that are not conflict free and their due diligence efforts to determine the source and chain of custody of the metals. Conflict Free means the product does not contain tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten that directly or indirectly finances or benefits armed groups in the or an adjoining country.
supports efforts to eliminate the use of tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten from improper sources that could promote such serious problems in the and adjoining countries.
Accordingly, AOI’s policy on Conflict Minerals is:
strives to have a Conflict Free supply chain, and is committed to sourcing products and materials from conflict-free sources
expects our vendors to have policies and processes in place to be able to trace the source of their materials and products to ensure that any Conflict Minerals contained in products we purchase from our vendors do not originate from conflict mines within the and the surrounding region
will provide applicable vendors with the standardized Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition/Global E-Sustainability Initiative (EICC/GeSI) Conflict Minerals Reporting Template (CMRT) that traces the metals back through the supply chain. also supports industry initiatives such as the Conflict-Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI) Conflict Free Smelter Program (CFSP) to validate responsible and sustainable sources. Our objective is to have a conflict-free supply chain. If becomes aware of a vendor whose supply chain includes metals from a conflict source, will take the appropriate actions to remedy the situation in a timely manner, including reassessment of vendor relationships, to achieve that objective. expects our vendors to take similar measures with their vendors to ensure alignment throughout the supply chain.
