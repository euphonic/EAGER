Oden Warren, President & CTO
Dr. Oden Warren is the President and Chief Technology Officer at Hysitron, Inc. He received his Ph.in Physical Chemistry in 1993 from Iowa State University of Science & Technology, where he studied as an Amoco Foundation Fellow. His graduate research on surface crystallography of reconstructed thin films earned him an Alpha Chi Sigma Research Excellence Award. Thereafter, he conducted postdoctoral research at Sandia National Laboratories-New Mexico, and at The University of Western Ontario, in the area of interfacial force microscopy.
After joining in 1998, he led the development effort for the TriboIndenter® nanomechanical test instrument, the company's flagship product. In 2005, his concept of a three-dimensional nanomechanical tester received a Nano 50 Award from Nanotech Briefs for the physically realized 3OmniProbe™ product. He is the Principal Investigator for Phase (completed successfully in 2005) and Phase (ongoing) grants awarded by the Department of Energy for the development of quantitative nanoindentation in-situ to a transmission electron microscope. He also represents the company in drafting and standards for instrumented indentation. He has been issued 11 patents, given more than 30 invited talks, and has co-authored more than 70 papers, on nanomechanics, nanotribology, and surface science. Oden's papers have been cited over 2500 times with an h-index of 25. In 2015 Oden received Iowa State University's John Atanasoff Discovery Award, awarded to alumni who have significantly advanced scientific knowledge through laboratory accomplishments and/or management. His latest research interests include optimizing feedback-controlled nanoindentation, enhancing the role of nanoindentation in combinatorial materials science, and understanding fundamental deformation mechanisms through quantitative nanoindentation coupled to transmission electron microscopy. His technical expertise spans the range of nanomechanics, scanning probe microscopy, instrumentation and software development, capacitive transducer and piezoelectric actuator design, and ultra-high vacuum surface science.

Lance Kuhn, Director of Customer Service
Lance Kuhn is the Director of Customer Service at Hysitron. He is responsible for Hysitron’s customer support world-wide, and manages Hysitron’s customer service team consisting of internal employees and external agents at various distributors throughout the world. His commitment to maintaining a premier level of customer satisfaction and instrument operation has made Hysitron’s customer service among the best in the industry. Lance received a Bachelor’s degree in Physics from the University of Wisconsin in 1995.
Lance started his career at as an applications engineer in 1996 and has been with since then. He is one of the few employees who worked in the company when it had only a handful of customers. As instrument sales grew, so did the need for increased customer service. Based on his extensive understanding of both instrumentation and applications, Lance was ideal for the customer service position, taking full advantage of his expertise with regard to technology and platforms. In addition, Lance has been involved in development of new instrumentation for the last ten years, using his extensive experience and first-hand customer feedback information to suggest changes and improvements to Hysitron’s technology.English
