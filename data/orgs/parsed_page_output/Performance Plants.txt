About Inc. is a privately owned, internationally recognized, mature agriculture biotechnology developer with a series of powerful, validated ‘game-changing’ technologies that are readily applied to major staple crops for significant improvement of their productivity.  The Company has a solid Research & Development platform, a robust pipeline of products, and a successful commercialization strategy that has secured licensing or co-development agreements with many major multinational seed companies such as Bayer Cropscience, Dupont/Pioneer, RiceTec, DBN, Biocentury Transgene and Mahyco. The company has recently opened up the Chinese and Indian market by establishing multiple licensing and commercial product development agreements with leading Chinese and Indian seed and agricultural biotechnology companies. 
is involved in gene discovery, trait development & commercialization of technologies for seeds to protect and enhance yields in all major crops globally.  PPI’s technology will allow farmers in many countries to increase yields and reduce the need for irrigation, particularly in drought and heat stressed areas. It also reduces the need for other costly and potentially harmful chemicals while helping to feed a growing population and reduces emissions and water usage. 
also has a technology that has shown to increase the yield of biomass for non-food biofuel crops.  does not introduce any foreign genes into its products; rather it regulates the plant's own genes to increase or decrease expression of the genes responsible for key traits. 
recently signed their third commercial license agreement with Bayer CropScience for the use of PPI’s Heat and Drought Tolerance Technology in wheat.  This agreement was announced by a press release in August, 2013. It is significant because wheat is very susceptible to heat above 26 degrees Celsius and Bayer CropScience is a world leader in wheat seed sales and in development of next generation of high-yielding wheat using biotechnologies.
