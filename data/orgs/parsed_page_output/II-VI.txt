Our Name and History   SIX
The Roman numerals “II-VI” refers to group and group of the Periodic Table of Elements. By chemically combining elements from these groups, produced the infrared optical crystalline compounds: Cadmium Telluride (CdTe), Zinc Selenide (ZnSe), Zinc Sulfide (ZnS) and Zinc Sulfide MultiSpectral (ZnMS). These compounds and others created from group and group elements are commonly referred to as “Materials”. Founded in 1971 to create CdTe, company co-founder Dr. Carl Johnson paid homage to our Materials heritage by calling our new company “Incorporated”.
