2nd Generation ATP® - Your 1st Line of Defense
2nd Generation monitoring offers a powerful combination of speed, versatility, portability, and accuracy for microbiological testing in any industry concerned with water. All living cells contain regardless of whether they are bacteria, fungi, or any other type of microbe. As such, its measurement is a direct indication of the microbiological content in your sample. All-inclusive results in minutes provide enhanced monitoring capabilities for superior control of microorganisms in your process.

Heterotrophic Plate Count
Traditional culture-based methods are very slow (2+ days to obtain results) and very selective (<1% of total population detected). 2nd Generation measures all cells to ensure that no threat goes unnoticed and results are available immediately.
2nd Generation ATP
Traditional tests provide the required pass/fail indication required for surface hygiene applications. LuminUltra’s 2nd Generation technology goes far beyond 1st Generation products through enhanced sensitivity and accuracy, providing the required fully-quantitative measurement for any water or wastewater sample.
2nd Generation ATP
Suspended Solids
Depending on the application, Suspended Solids measurements (including Turbidity and Particle Counts) may be used to indicate overall loading (wastewater) or perhaps sediment intrusion (water), but they do not isolate microbiological content. As such, are not effective ways to investigate microbiological issues and can sometimes be misleading. 2nd Generation monitoring quantifies the biological content of these samples, enabling the issue to be characterized and optimized much more effectively.

Hear What Our Customers Say About Us
Laboratory Manager, Greenville Water – Greenville, South Carolina, USA
Aurora Water (Aurora, CO) has been using LuminUltra’s test to measure and monitor Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) in the biofiltration process at the Binney Water Purification Facility (BWPF) sApril 2012. This easy to perform test allows staff to quickly determine levels on the biofilter during start-up of the processes, as well as during routine operation.

Sr. Analyst, Aurora Water – Aurora, Colorado, USA
was amazed at the fact that we could measure total microorganisms in a matter of minutes…
Lee Thorton
Thorton, Musso & Bellemin – Zachary, Louisiana, USA
LuminUltra’s technology as advertised should be considered as the “1st Line of Defense” tool of choice and first primary testing tool for microbial activity.
Johnny Richard
Owner, Real World Surveillance – Summit, Mississippi, USA
has assisted us in maintaining bioreactor performance.  We recommend this technology to any facility looking to improve process control and plant stability.
Jeanie Grandstaff
Hopewell Regional Wastewater Treatment Facility – Hopewell, Virginia, USA
They are the only test kit manufacturer that has developed a family of test kits – each optimized for a range of applications. They are also the only test kit manufacturer with an method that differentiates bacteria from fungi. They are undoubtedly head and shoulders above other test kit manufacturers.

[News Release] One-stop microbiology management now available as Luminacquires InstantLabs
September 19, 2018
September 19, 2018 – It’s now possible to both quickly and easily identify all microbes in a sample and determine the abundance of specific microbes as LuminUltra, a global market leader in rapid and portable microbiological monitoring tools, has acquired InstantLabs , a developer of DNA-based measurement technologies.
“Luminis now a one-stop shop for microbiology management in a variety of sectors, including drinking water, wastewater, industrial, and oil and gas. We can provide a comprehensive picture of how many microorganisms are in our customers’ processes and which ones are having the most impact, and we can do this within minutes to hours,” says Pat Whalen, President and of LuminUltra. “By adding InstantLabs’ DNA-based measurement tools, we can offer a more complete picture while maintaining our hallmark rapid feedback. That means both faster and better decision-making for our customers.”
InstantLabs, a Lumincompany, provides rapid, point-of-use solutions for quickly quantifying specific microbes or groups of microbes via Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) as well as best-in-class Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) for identifying all microbes and their abundance in a given sample. These products complement LuminUltra’s flagship 2nd Generation (Adenosine Triphosphate) measurement products, which provide on-the-spot information on total microbiological population size in a matter of minutes.
“Our analysis products and services have been specifically designed to identify and measure those microorganisms that have the most impact on the industries we serve,” says Neil Sharma, Vice President, Product Development, LuminUltra, and the leader of InstantLabs. “We can show the cause-and-effect relationship of key microbes so that system operators can keep things running smoothly while also achieving operating efficiencies and reduced costs. Moving forward, we’ll be able to identify trends and discover other microorganisms that could potentially be harmful so that operators can be even more proactive.”
