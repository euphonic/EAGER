Philosophy
We strive to teach as many people as possible about the risks of microorganisms in water systems and what can be done about them.  It’s our vision to be your first line of defense.  To achieve that, we provide fast and simple solutions to microbiological problems in water.  Our message is simple: if you do not measure it, you cannot control it.
We work hard to help our customers gain more information and fix problems.  We are innovators, striving continually to improve our products.  We happily spend time providing straightforward training tools, data analysis assistance and accessible, personalized support to our customers and partners around the globe.
Through fast and operator-friendly microbiological measurement tools, we give you an accurate answer to the most critical question:

The testing is going great.  We are effectively using it to help determine if nitrification is taking place in areas of our distribution system.  We typically will see high nitrite levels and have to wait 7 days for our (R2A) results.  The test is giving us results that same day.
