*product lines include Optical Encoders, application specific Silicon Photodiodes and Light Emitting Diodes (LED) systems.  Our optical encoders offer numerous configurations to meet the wide demands of the motion control industry.  Utilizing our silicon foundry we partner with our customers to manufacture small to medium batch custom photodiodes for numerous industries and applications.
Our History
Devices, Inc. (QDI) Barneveld, WI, was established as a Wisconsin corporation in October 1989, as an outgrowth of activities in the general area of optoelectronics. Ron Ignatius, the founder of Devices, was a forward thinker in the industry of silicon manufacturing and light emitting diodes (LED) technologies.  Ron’s passion for photovoltaic technology started in the early 1970’s in the solar cell industry in the greater Chicago area.  This lead Ron to managing a silicon foundry in Central Wisconsin, before venturing out on his own at the age of 50.  With the support of his family and his life savings Ron started Devices, Inc.  In the early days, focused on technologies and packaging them into systems for the medical industry.  With early success established it headquarters in Barneveld,  With the new facility came the addition of a class 1,000 clean room and multiple patents on photovoltaic technologies.  One of these breakthroughs was an encoder photodiode technology.  This technology was not widely accepted in the industry at first.  So in true Ron fashion, “if encoder companies don’t want to use our superior sensing technology, we will.”  In 1999 became an encoder manufacturer.  Early growth was contributed to the industries 1st fundamental read 5000 line count encoder in a 1.5″ package. Since these early days has developed a full compliment of incremental optical encoders to fit multiple industries and applications.
Our Facilities
Devices, Inc. is an 9001:2015 facility.  Our vertically integrated manufacturing allows us to control the quality of our product by relying on our expertise in the areas of photodiode fabrication, electrical assembly, injection molding plastics and machined components.  These areas of expertise allow our based manufacturing to be globally competitive.
