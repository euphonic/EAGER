Future      development will provide a series of Enviroelectric generators covering larger micro-grid single units,      modular power plant applications and smaller use systems      approaching residential needs.  Solar power farms along      with solar desalinization will follow the generator market.       Throughout commercialization and beginning manufacturing both      abatement and CO2 conversion and capture products will be      pursued through reinvestment in R&D.
