AcceptWhat is Biotechnology?
At its simplest, biotechnology is technology based on biology – biotechnology harnesses cellular and biomolecular processes to develop technologies and products that help improve our lives and the health of our planet. We have used the biological processes of microorganisms for more than 6,000 years to make useful food products, such as bread and cheese, and to preserve dairy products.
Modern biotechnology provides breakthrough products and technologies to combat debilitating and rare diseases, reduce our environmental footprint, feed the hungry, use less and cleaner energy, and have safer, cleaner and more efficient industrial manufacturing processes.
Currently, there are more than 250 biotechnology health care products and vaccines available to patients, many for previously untreatable diseases. More than 13.3 million farmers around the world use agricultural biotechnology to increase yields, prevent damage from insects and pests and reduce farming’s impact on the environment. And more than 50 biorefineries are being built across North America to test and refine technologies to produce biofuels and chemicals from renewable biomass, which can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
In this section, we will provide periodic updates on key issues facing the advancement of science and the ability of researcher and entrepreneurs to deliver the latest medical and biological breakthroughs to people who need them around the world.
Introducing DrugCostFacts.org
Ensuring that our families and loved ones have access to the medicines and treatments they need is one of the most important issues we face as individuals and as a society. Yet, understanding the complexities and various entities that make up our nation’s health care system can be a daunting and extremely frustrating endeavor.
To make it a bit easier, there is a new interactive tool called drugcostfacts.org
The site features a series of commonly asked questions—ranging from “Why are some drugs expensive?” to “What role do PBMs, insurance companies and wholesalers play in determining what patients pay for their drugs?”—and then answers these questions using infographics, videos and interactive tools. The site also has additional research and reading materials if you want to dive deeper into these issues. The tool is mobile responsive, allowing you to access information on your phone or tablet.
Drugcostfacts.org also features a “Follow the Debate” section, where you can get more information on topics ranging from drug importation to government negotiations in Medicare that are making headlines and that are part of the current policy and public debate.
The goal of the site is to be a one-stop shop for information and answers to some of the most hotly debated questions regarding the role of prescription drugs in our nation’s health care system.
Become an advocate for biotechnology…join Bioaction
As breakthroughs in science and medicine transform the way we treat patients for a wide range of diseases and ailments, it is critical that we educate and inform public policy makers and elected officials about how their actions can impact medical advancements and the development of new medicines. Make your voice heard! It’s easy to do – check out BIO’s new online tool to contact your federal or state public officials with your views via e-mail, phone or social media. The site also features background and information on key issues impacting the development of new medicines and patient access to the medicines they need. Go ahead and try it out!

Please confirm you are a healthcare professional.Welcome to Therapeutics.
We are a global biotechnology company at the forefront of advancing therapies for a range of rare and devastating diseases and our excellent team has a very big and a very bold vision. Each program that we invest in has to have three key characteristics. It has to be in the rare diseases for a devastating disorder, the technology has to have the potential to be first in class or best in class, and the clinical data must be able to provide meaningful benefit for patients. As we pursue treatments for rare metabolic disorders, we maintain a personal and compassionate focus on patients, their caregivers, and families.
This personal and direct relationship with patients embodies the culture of our organization and drives what we do very passionately every day. Every biotech company says it’s focused on patients, but at we do it in a different way. You see it when you go to our offices around the world where we have pictures of patients with the diseases we treat accompanied by narratives about their struggles, identities, and lives.
How do we take that perspective and build it into every part of the business? All the way from team meetings to the board of directors, we try to make all our decisions as if we were living with these diseases or were a mom or dad or kid caring for someone with this disorder. What would be important to me as a patient? What would be a meaningful advancement or a risk would take? We do more than say that we are patient focused – we live it.
That dedication to patients goes hand-in-hand with our dedication to ethics and compliance. You can’t have one without the other. Acting with integrity and complying with law ensures that everything we do for patients meets the highest standards of safety and professionalism.
What am most proud of at is the resilience and persistence of our team. The ability to look to the future for our vision of what we want the company to be then engage in a journey of learning, adjustment, and focus takes a special type of person. My role is to set the vision and make sure that day to day it is achieved through extraordinary science, aligning priorities, and hiring the greatest people in the world to be here. Our passion unites us as we remain committed to helping those in need.
All the best,
John Crowley
