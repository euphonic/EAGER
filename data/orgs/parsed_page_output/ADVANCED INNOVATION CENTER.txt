SYSTEM
The Plasma Water Sanitation System (PWSS) is an innovative water treatment system that eliminates 100% of virus and bacteria through the transformation of a continuous flow of contaminated water into plasma. Through a sharp pressure drop inside the reaction chamber, the water is transformed into biphasic liquid-gas stream.
SYSTEM
technology is the application of mechanical sound waves to stimulate production and recovery of hydrocarbons. With a global production of 90 million barrels of oil per day and proven reserves exceeding 1,500 billion barrels, promotes quicker monetization and more resources to monetize.
