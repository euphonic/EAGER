About SICK's company history
When used in combination with precise optics and intelligent electronics, light can provide the answer to a wide range of issues. This potential was recognized quite some time ago by Dr. E.h. Erwin Sick, who set up his own company back in 1946. In the years that followed, developed his company into a global provider of intelligent sensors and solutions for industrial automation technology.

1946
The company known today as is born:
Erwin obtains a license from the American military government in Munich to set up his own engineering firm.
1952
Presentation of the first marketable accident prevention light curtain at the International Machine Tool Trade Fair in Hanover. The orders that followed led to the initial serial production and the economic breakthrough.
1956
The company moves to Waldkirch, Germany with its 25 employees.
1972
The first subsidiary is founded in France.
1975
The company expands overseas with the founding of a subsidiary in the USA.
1988
Erwin dies at the age of 79. Gisela takes over from her husband and leads the company as its primary shareholder.
1996

2017
now has more than 50 subsidiaries and equity investments as well as numerous agencies around the globe. achieved Group sales of about 1.5 bn. in the 2017 fiscal year with almost 9,000 employees worldwide.
1909
Erwin was born on November 3 to a train driver in Heilbronn, Germany.
1924 - 1928
Apprenticeship in the field of optics.
1932
Start of career at Siemens & Halske, Berlin, as an optical arithmetician; however, the department was closed after six months. He was moved to the laboratory and was given experimental, arithmetic, and constructive tasks, particularly in the area of color film.
1934 – 1939
Employment – initially as a constructor, later as an engineer – at Siemens, Bosch and Askania working on demanding development projects on color film, cinematics, and astronomical and physical devices.
1939 - 1945
Laboratory manager at the optical works of Steinheil & Söhne, Munich.
1944
Married Gisela Neumann.
1945
Became self-employed: In an old barracks in Vaterstetten near Munich, where Erwin lived with his wife, he single-mindedly followed his technological development aims to produce opto-electronic devices. He used the earnings from selling radios he made himself to support his family.
1946
Founded what was later to become on September 26: The apolitical Erwin received a permit from the American military government to practice his profession as an engineer.
1949
First orders received at the “Achema” fair in Frankfurt after a long hiatus. This was an exhibition meeting for chemical apparatus organized by suppliers to the chemical industry.
1951
At the “German Inventor and New Development Trade Fair” in Munich in July, presents the first wooden model he had made of his light curtain and receives a certificate for exceptional creative performance. On October 20, the patent registration for the light curtain invented by Erwin based on the autocollimation principle is the technical breakthrough and forms the basis of an entire range of devices.
1952
presents the first marketable accident prevention light curtain at the Second International Machine Tool Trade Fair in Hanover. The orders that followed led to the initial serial production and eventually to the company's economic breakthrough.
1954
Erwin tries in vain to obtain a loan from the Free State of Bavaria to build up the company. When Baden-Württemberg offers to lend him the money he needs, he moves from Munich to Oberkirch in Baden.
1956
Relocation of the company – along with its 25 employees – from Oberkirch to Waldkirch into the building of August Faller KG, located at An der Allee 7-9. 
In October, is granted the patent for a new type of photoelectric retro-reflective sensor that will later become the product with one of the company's strongest sales.
1960
Founding of the “Institute for Automation” in Munich for developing optoelectronic devices for industrial applications. Sick's main argument for founding the organization in Bavaria's state capital is the shortage of qualified engineers in Waldkirch.
1971
Erwin is presented with the Bundesverdienstkreuz 1. Klasse (Order of the Federal Republic of Germany, Ist Class) by Justice Minister Rudolf Schieler on November 26 to commemorate the company's 25th anniversary.

 Moved into the new factory on Sebastian-Kneipp-Strasse, which remains the company's headquarters to this day.
1980
On November 19, the Faculty for Machines at the Technical University of Munich awards Erwin his honorary doctorate in engineering in recognition of his contribution to the scientific and constructive development of optical devices with electronic signal evaluation.
1982
On December 2, Erwin receives the gold Diesel Medal for his numerous inventions in the field of opto-electronics.
1988
Erwin dies on December 3 after suffering a fatal heart attack at the age of 79.
