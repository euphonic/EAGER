About SICK's company history
When used in combination with precise optics and intelligent electronics, light can provide the answer to a wide range of issues. This potential was recognized quite some time ago by Dr. E.h. Erwin Sick, who set up his own company back in 1946. In the years that followed, developed his company into a global provider of intelligent sensors and solutions for industrial automation technology.

1909
Erwin was born on November 3 to a train driver in Heilbronn, Germany.
1924 - 1928
Apprenticeship in the field of optics.
1932
Start of career at Siemens & Halske, Berlin, as an optical arithmetician; however, the department was closed after six months. He was moved to the laboratory and was given experimental, arithmetic, and constructive tasks, particularly in the area of color film.
1934 – 1939
Employment – initially as a constructor, later as an engineer – at Siemens, Bosch and Askania working on demanding development projects on color film, cinematics, and astronomical and physical devices.
1939 - 1945
Laboratory manager at the optical works of Steinheil & Söhne, Munich.
1944
Married Gisela Neumann.
1945
Became self-employed: In an old barracks in Vaterstetten near Munich, where Erwin lived with his wife, he single-mindedly followed his technological development aims to produce opto-electronic devices. He used the earnings from selling radios he made himself to support his family.
1946
Founded what was later to become on September 26: The apolitical Erwin received a permit from the American military government to practice his profession as an engineer.
1949
First orders received at the “Achema” fair in Frankfurt after a long hiatus. This was an exhibition meeting for chemical apparatus organized by suppliers to the chemical industry.
1951

About Research and development
SICK's history is rife with successful innovations, and we intend to continue this success story well into the future.
Customer focus: The key to our success
Innovative products on their own are not enough to ensure a company's success. Rather, it is a matter of making sure that these innovations provide outstanding customer benefits, because the ultimate measure of the newly developed products is how successful they are on the market. Our success relies on us implementing these thought processes consistently, and it is our knowledge and understanding of what our customers need that allows us to anticipate future developments. In this way, our customers reap the benefits of more compact designs with the same level of performance, increased sensor ruggedness, and faster, more efficient workflow processes.
– Sensor Intelligence.
Developing intelligent solutions for customer applications is at the forefront of what we do. To make this a reality, we are constantly on the lookout for new technologies that allow sensors to not only perceive objects, but also offer intelligent process control and communicate with other components in complex networks.
Research and development activities
We are constantly increasing our research and development activities to allow us to retain our status as a technological and market leader.
Research and development staff
At SICK, we don't simply rely on our central research departments and remote development teams of more than 1100 employees worldwide to carry out our research and development activities. To ensure that our sensors are accessible to all system environments and our customers can benefit from synergies in the development process, we also cooperate with industry partners, universities, and institutes.
Patents and knowledge
Innovations are what set us apart, and this is something we want to continue in the long term. This is why we use patents to protect our knowledge. With about 3,000 patents filed, it is clear just how many ideas our staff have developed.

About Corporate Social Responsibility
Conflict minerals
In the Democratic Republic of Congo and neighboring states in particular, the ongoing armed conflict is financed by the mining of certain natural resources. In these locations, militia commit the most grievous human rights violations in their efforts to control the mines and sell the extracted “conflict minerals” (predominantly gold, tantalum, tungsten, and tin – “3minerals”) across the globe.
In the USA, a number of companies are obliged by law to issue reports indicating whether and to what extent 3minerals have been procured from the conflict region. The aim of this is to ensure that, in future, only conflict-free 3minerals are bought and traded. In particular, this is to be achieved by means of a system of certified smelting. The respective Conflict Minerals Directive also stipulates a reporting and certification obligation for smelting operations and refineries and large importers of raw materials.
is affected neither by the nor the reporting obligation. Nevertheless, respects the underlying objective of this rule – to prevent the financing of militant groups who commit human rights violations – and pledges its commitment to achieving this objective. is working towards only using conflict-free 3minerals in its own products and, within this context, explicitly endorses the establishment of the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP) of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI).

About Corporate social responsibility
Sustainable commitments based on solid growth and financial independence
operates as part of the local community across all of its sites. Solid growth and financial independence are the basis for making sustainable commitments in many areas within the company.
makes a significant contribution to promoting research and developing state-of-the-art technology through its close cooperation with universities, technical colleges, and institutes. It also creates employment outside of the company, with external subcontractors involved in the development, procurement, and service processes from the outset. This loyalty to its suppliers is just one of the factors that makes a reliable partner to companies all over the world.
We are acutely aware of our responsibility toward future generations. For this reason, one of our key objectives is to become a leading force in the areas of climate and environmental protection.
Our responsibility to be a reliable employer is something we take very seriously. After all, this is something that specialists and managers are only too aware of when deciding where to work in the current climate. For this reason, the way we deal with human resources is so important to us, as it allows us to maintain our level of expertise in the future.

About Sensor Intelligence.
Industrial automation is changing at an extremely rapid pace. As an innovation leader on the vanguard of developing cutting-edge sensor technology, offers solutions today that are ready for the challenges of the future – with intelligent sensors that collect data, evaluate it in real time, adapt to their environment, and communicate in the network.
“Sensor Intelligence.”: Tailored Solution
With all our solutions, we bear the individual requirements of your processes in mind. “Sensor Intelligence.” draws on all of SICK’s system expertise, supplemented by our experience in a variety of sectors. We combine our detailed application knowledge with reliable software architecture to optimally integrate our sensors into your system – because intelligent is the only way.
“Sensor Intelligence.” refers to the ability of our sensors to use decentralized computing power to complete tasks more reliably, more comprehensively, or more efficiently, for example. To achieve this, we take the intelligence required to perform these tasks from the central control system, and place it in our sensors.
Intelligent sensors benefit from the availability of ever-smaller, ever-cheaper microcontrollers. These controllers enable our sensors to process increasing volumes of data directly, using ever more complex algorithms. And this technology helps you to optimize your production and control networks.
“Sensor Intelligence.” to Organize the Factory of the Future
Networked production and control processes in complex machine environments will determine the industrial future. Our smart sensor solutions already support dynamic, real-time-optimized, and self-organized industry processes... Our sensors record real operational statuses, turn these into digital data, and share them automatically with your process controller.
The degree of digitization, intelligence, and networking is set to increase continually in production and logistics systems, until these systems can eventually control and optimize themselves autonomously. The cyber-physical production systems in the smart factories of the future will organize themselves, using huge amounts of up-to-date information to make independent decisions. This information is provided by our sensors.
With “Sensor Intelligence.”, we are making Industry 4.0 a reality – and we are doing it today.

About Corporate Social Responsibility
Environmental protection
Many processing steps are required before raw materials are turned into finished products. For each of these steps there are starting points whereby can shape the production process to be more sustainable.
Adhering closely to the tradition of the company founder, Dr. Erwin – who showed a passionate concern for the environment as early as 60 years ago – has therefore made a conscious decision to develop the company in a sustainable way. In order to minimize the negative environmental impact during the production process to the greatest degree possible, follows a three-tiered climate and environmental protection strategy:
We avoid what we can.
We reduce, what we cannot avoid.
We optimize what we cannot reduce.
The basis for SICK's strategy is formed by an environmental and energy management system that has been firmly established within the company for a number of years. publishes an annual environmental statement in accordance with the standard, which uses core indicators to provide information about all relevant environmental impacts and the environmental objectives derived from them. achieves these environmental objectives by implementing projects in a wide range of divisions within the three tiers that are defined in the climate and environmental protection strategy. The focus here is placed on four areas of activity:
CO² emissions
Refuse and waste water
Material usage and hazardous substances
Through products 
Certification:
All sites in Germany and the manufacturing subsidiaries in Hungary, the and Malaysia are certified according to the 14001 environmental management system. In addition to this, the headquarters in Waldkirch, the site in Reute, and Vertriebs-Gmbin Düsseldorf have an environmental management system in accordance with (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) and a certified energy management system according to 50001
selection of real-life examples
Solar-powered electricity
In 2011, a total of 975 m² of photovoltaics were installed and operated by external investors on the roofs at Reute and Waldkirch. has provided a total area of 1375 m². An installed capacity of almost 170 kWp generates approx. 160,000 kWh of power on roofs every year.
Looking good – even for the environment!
For quite some time now, companies in many different sectors have been using sensors to streamline their production processes and thereby conserve resources. Even in its own processes, takes care to ensure that the materials and equipment it uses are as environmentally friendly as possible. The gradual switch to water-based painting systems is saving up to 3.5 tons of solvent emissions every year!
All is well in the electronics manufacturing department
Reliable and efficient electronics are at the heart of all sensors. But even this demanding manufacturing process makes use of environmentally friendly methods. Lead-free soldering has been in place at since 2006 and is available for use in new developments.
