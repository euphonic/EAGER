Technology for a better world.
Scientists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who were concentrating their research on improving the manufacture and use of enzymes, founded in 2003. Since then, our expanding team of professionals have worked on projects ranging from discovering ways to improve the production of biofuels to solving challenges associated with the use of enzymes in consumer products. Our innovative solutions have earned several research grants from both the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Energy.
Our scientists are experts in biochemistry, plant biology, molecular biology, agriculture, and nutrition. Our management team has over a hundred years’ experience tackling tough problems in commercial agriculture. All of our employees, partners, and investors share a common vision, that of using the power of technology to build a better future.
is committed to using technology to produce wholesome, affordable food in an efficient and sustainable way. We believe technology can make the world a better place, which is why our researchers and scientists are constantly working on innovative technology like GRAINZYME® enzymes. 
While we are focused today on enzymes that improve poultry and swine nutrition, we also expect to make significant contributions to nutrition in dairy and beef cattle, as well as aquaculture. Eventually, we will be moving beyond enzymes because there is so much more that can be done with our core technology platform.
At Agrivida, we’re embracing the future today.
