Overview
Founded in the mid-1970s as a collective of scientists committed to developing innovative products for the life sciences industry, is now a recognized world leader in the discovery and production of enzymes for molecular biology applications.
– putting science first
Created "by scientists for scientists", is renowned for consistently providing exceptional product quality and unsurpassed technical support. For over four decades, has been shaping the landscape of bioscience research by discovering, developing and supporting superior research reagents. From our founding principles – placing the advancement of science and the stewardship of the environment as our highest priorities – to our unique corporate culture, NEB’s philosophy can be distilled down to three core values: passion, humility and being genuine. 
supplier-of-choice for scientists across the globe, offers the largest selection of recombinant and native enzymes for genomic research. While restriction enzymes remain part of our core product portfolio, our ever-expanding catalog also includes products related to PCR, gene expression, sample preparation for next generation sequencing, synthetic biology, glycobiology, epigenetics and analysis. Additionally, is focused on strengthening alliances that enable technologies to reach key market sectors, including molecular diagnostics development.
Learn more about NEB’s commitment to environmental stewardship, scientific advancement and education, humanitarian efforts and employee well-being in our Social and Environmental Sustainability Brochure .
is registered as a small business with the United States Small Business Administration.
Biolabs’ laboratories more closely resemble those of a research institute than a biotech company, and with good reason; the over 100 scientists at are engaged in research in areas that include enzyme analysis and engineering, epigenetics, biology and parasitology. As a result, scientists have published over 1100 papers to date. In an effort to foster science education, scientists also supervise post-doctoral associates, student interns and Ph.students engaged in research projects. With this dual focus on both basic and applied research, NEB’s culture is collaborative and academic. We have relationships with a number of outside laboratories and host weekly seminars that bring together leading researchers with our community to facilitate the exchange of ideas.
Technical Support
From its inception, has always placed a strong emphasis on providing timely and relevant support for its products, often by the very scientists that develop and validate the product. Product queries are directed to bench scientists – at the bench! We strive to offer the highest level of customer service with a personalized approach. You will find the same dedication to customer satisfaction in our administrative staff; whether entering an order, setting up your accounts, or delivering focused and engaging material on the website, we continue to provide our customers with the quality, dependability and value that they have come to expect from us.
Environmental Focus
Driven by a strong sense of corporate responsibility, has committed to minimizing the environmental impact of its operations, with the ultimate goal of leaving the world a greener/bluer and healthier planet. Towards this end, has made a strong commitment to company-wide “greening” projects. The first and most visible of these steps was the building of the campus in Ipswich, The main laboratory building is LEED® (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certified and was designed to make efficient use of external light. Solar Aquatics® water reclamation plant treats and cleans the campus’ wastewater, making it suitable for reuse or groundwater recharge. An early step towards a healthier planet was taken by NEB, over 30 years ago, when we started the first shipping box recycling program. That program, still in operation, has been a model for environmentally-minded companies across the nation.
NEB’s commitment to the preservation of the planet’s resources is a real and driving force in the company’s founding of the Ocean Genome Legacy Center (OGL), a not-for-profit, private research foundation. OGL’s mandate is to promote the conservation of marine genomic diversity by creating a permanent library of genomic from as many marine species as possible. The library will preserve and maintain the samples, as well as provide to collaborating researchers. Making these samples widely available will ensure that the secrets stored in a species’ genome will not be irretrievably lost, even once the species is.
Good Citizen Programs
Making the world a better place is a cornerstone of NEB’s mission. Being a good neighbor, locally and globally, is just one way that ensures the betterment of the people it touches. For example, contributes to the community through the Foundation , which supports environmental awareness, education, health and the arts. By funding grants and programs to encourage engagement in the community, as with the Creative Action Institute , is able to reach out and change lives. In combination with the Ocean Genome Legacy Center, is an example of NEB’s enduring promise to improve the communities that it influences.
* The Foundation is a private independent foundation whose mission is to foster community-based conservation of landscapes and seascapes, and the bio-cultural diversity found in these places.
* The Creative Action Institute (formerly known as ArtCorps) works at the intersection of creativity and social change. They work to build the capacity of leaders and organizations for innovation, collaboration and resilience to advance conservation, health and human rights globally.
*The Ocean Genome Legacy Center of is a non-profit research center dedicated to conservation of marine genome diversity and maintaining a repository of genomic from marine organisms around the world.

Quality at NEB
Biolabs® is committed to supporting the worldwide scientific research community, as well as our industrial customers’ technology platforms, by supplying the highest quality reagents, backed by unmatched product and customer support.
NEB’s Quality Unit is responsible for developing and executing stringent quality standards for NEB’s entire portfolio of products. The structure of the Quality Unit enables a two-tiered approach to evaluating and ensuring product quality. At the compliance level, is guided by the quality certifications that it has been awarded. These standards require a transparent and traceable process, from beginning to end. Certificates of Origin and Change Management are two such processes. At the analytical level, relies on its assortment of cutting-edge quality controls, designed for assessing a product’s physical attributes and confirming the physical purity of finished products.
Below, you’ll find additional details on NEB’s Quality Unit, including:
Product lifecycle tracking practices (expiration dating and barcoding)
Industry-leading quality controls
Examples of product quality across multiple vendors
NEB’s Quality Policy details NEB’s commitment to achieving and maintaining the highest possible product quality. The Life Science Industry Awards (LSIA) recognized NEB’s molecular biology products as having exceptional purity and performance. Learn more in our press releases .
For questions about NEB’s quality processes for standard and custom products, please contact info@neb.com .
Quality Assurance
NEB’s Quality Assurance team maintains strict quality standards and recordkeeping, ensuring the traceability and accuracy of NEB’s product data. Below are just a few of the ways in which ensures that its processes are beyond reproach. If you have any questions, please contact info@neb.com .
holds both 13485: 2016 and 9001: 2015 certifications at its headquarters in Ipswich, (USA). Learn more about our certifications on our Certifications page.
In response to customer need, is moving into the manufacturing space. manufacturing facility is under construction, and the first products are expected to be available in 2017. For more details about NEB's products and its facility, please visit the press release .
Product Certificates of Origin are available upon request.
Established validation programs for:
– Automated filling lines
– Product storage chambers
– Critical process equipment
Use of a validated 21Part 11-compliant electronic Quality Management Software (eQMS) for Quality records and document control
has been recognized for the quality of its products; most recently, was awarded a Life Science Industry Award® (LSIA) for its “Molecular Biology Products”, citing both product purity and performance. Additional details can be found in our press release .
Case studies (>40 available upon request) of the use of products in regulated applications are available. reagents are currently used in the following regulated applications:
         – Molecular Diagnostics
Expiration Dating Policy
now has a policy of assigning expiration dates to many of our enzymes and reagents. This policy is designed to satisfy the needs of a growing number of our customers who require such information to meet their regulatory requirements. For such customers, the expiration date indicates the period of time over which will guarantee 100% activity of the enzyme if stored under the recommended storage conditions.*
Our expiration dates have been developed as a result of many years of experience with our products and represent a minimum guaranteed life expectancy for full activity of a given product. It is not the intent of this dating policy to imply that a product will necessarily lose activity after the expiration date. In fact, many of our enzymes will retain significant, if not full, activity for many months or even years after the expiration date. For many basic research applications, enzyme vials may be suitable for use well past their stated expiration date. Disposal and or continued use of enzymes past their expiration dates should be at the discretion of the end user.
* Enzymes should be stored long-term at the recommended temperature (most often -20°C; some enzymes have alternate recommended storage temperatures, such as -80°C). During use, enzymes should be stored on ice, and then returned to their long term storage conditions promptly after use.
Barcoding System
uses a barcoding system that allows enhanced tracking of product within NEB, increases the accuracy of our shipping operations and also provides expanded product information for each shipped item.
The barcode (see image below) is based on Code 128 symbology, consists of a six-digit catalog number (eg., R0650S), an eight-digit lot number (eg., 10008628), a four-digit assay date (eg., 1803), and a four-digit expiration date (eg., 2003). For the four pieces of coded information (cat #, lot #, assay date, exp. date), the details are as follows:
catalog # - the standard six-digit system is our standard catalog number.
lot # - utilizes a system-assigned, non-intelligent lot number to identify every unique packaging run. This lot number is printed on the outside of the package and embedded in the package barcode.
assay date - this is a four-digit sequence, YYMM; for example, 1803 would indicate an assay date of March 2018.
expiration date - this is a four-digit sequence, YYMM; for example, 2003 would indicate an expiration date of March 2020.
Quality Control
NEB’s Quality Control team is at the heart of what sets NEB’s products apart from competitors’ – their outstanding purity and performance. Below are just a few of the ways in which ensures its product quality. If you have any questions, please contact info@neb.com .
range of standard Quality Controls are run for each product.
Stability testing methodology includes:
– Accelerated testing
– Freeze/thaw testing
– Rotational stress
– Real-time testing
product shelf life is set based on accelerated testing, performance of similar products, and verified by real-time testing.
Fully packaged retains are stored under controlled conditions for one year past expiration date.
Proprietary methods are developed by Research, Applications and Product Development scientists, and verified by Product Managers and the Quality Control lab.
Availability of Certificates of Analysis and Product Specifications for custom or catalog products
Lot-to-lot reproducibility is maintained by concentration measurement, activity measurement and functional testing.

Our Facility
Believing it possible to conduct cutting-edge research and production in a greener, less-environmentally impactful way, commissioned the building of a modern, LEED® certified (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) 140,000 square foot laboratory building.  certification is a distinction awarded based on a suite of environmentally focused standards that include site sustainability, water efficiency, energy conservation and atmospheric protection, choice of building materials and resources, indoor environmental quality, innovation and building design. In 2009, also received a “sustainable design” award from the Boston Society of Architects for this state-of-the-art facility, which was designed by Mart Ojamaa of Jung Brannen Associates.
Learn more about NEB’s commitment to environmental stewardship, scientific advancement and education, humanitarian efforts and employee well-being in our Social and Environmental Responsibility Brochure .
How the building optimizes energy usage:
lighting control system that shuts off lighting when building is unoccupied
heat recovery system in which the heat that is exhausted from the building is recycled to help heat incoming fresh air
Chillers that use Free Cooling when outside temperature is below 50°F, which allows chillers to shut off and still keep the building cool
true pioneer in sustainable business practices, established the first shipping box recycling program over thirty-five years ago.  Still in practice today in the and internationally, the program diverts cardboard and polystyrene from landfills.  In 1987, as part of an effort to minimize fuel consumption and shipping costs, introduced its freezer program, consolidating shipments and freezer utilization costs and providing on-demand molecular biology reagents in academic and research centers across the globe.  All publications, including manuals, datacards and marketing materials, are printed on recycled paper.  In addition, the Catalog & Technical Reference is printed on Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC) certified, 30% post-consumer recycled paper, reducing the need for trees, decreasing energy consumption and saving landfill space.  The Catalog is also the first CarbonNeutral® certified catalog produced in the United States (view the press release ).  The mail list is carefully monitored for returned mail to help reduce the volume of printed materials; the use of e-invoices also helps to decrease paper usage.  The extensive in-house recycling program includes paper, plastics, expanded polystyrene, glass, aluminum, batteries and electronics.
operates the longest-running shipping box recycling program, which diverts cardboard and polystyrene away from landfills.
The food service purchases local produce whenever possible. Composting in the cafe diverts as much as 75% of the cafe waste away from landfills. 
The janitorial staff uses environmentally friendly cleaning reagents 
In the warm-weather months, employees can take advantage of a farm stand brought to the campus, offering organically grown produce 
Since it was first published in 1975, the Catalog & Technical Reference has been a trusted resource for scientists around the world.  In addition to the extensive scientific information, each edition of the catalog contains minireviews that address various environmental topics of interest.  These articles endeavor to raise awareness about the impact we have on the environment and our need to act as stewards of the planet.  With the release of each catalog, pledges support to non-profit organizations that promote environmental awareness.
Read articles highlighting these important environmental topics: 
Ecologic, a group dedicated to empowering rural and indigenous peoples to restore tropical ecosystems in Central America and Mexico
Energy Access Foundation, an organization that increases access to clean and renewable energy through rural energy enterprises 
Aqua Para La Vida, an organization that works in rural Nicaragua to build safe drinking water and sanitation systems 
Trees, Water, People, a group dedicated to helping communities protect, conserve and manage natural resources 
WILD, a group dedicated to helping preserve the earth’s biodiversity 
Non-Profit Organizations
As part of our commitment to raising environmental awareness, has played a role in the establishment of two non-profit organizations: Foundation and the Ocean Genome Legacy Center of Biolabs.
The Foundation ( ), a private foundation established in 1982, fosters community-based conservation of landscapes and seascapes, and the bio-cultural diversity found in these places. For more information, please visit www.nebf.org .
The Ocean Genome Legacy Center of Biolabs, located at Northeastern University's Marine Science Center in Nahant, MA, promotes conservation of marine genomic diversity by creating and maintaining a repository of genomic from marine organisms from around the world. For more information, please visit the website at https://www.northeastern.edu/ogl/ .
also supports local environmental initiatives through our corporate donations program, which contributes to non-profit organizations.

Passion in Science Awards®
At Biolabs®, we believe that the pursuit of science is one path to building a greener and more compassionate world. We are motivated by a set of core, foundational values that are still as true today as they were when we founded the company over 40 years ago: the belief that science should be used to expand our understanding of the world around us; the belief that scientists can also act as humanitarians; the belief that all species, great and small, benefit when we care for the environment; and the belief that great science is fundamentally creative and artistic, and changes the way we see and experience our world.
In 2014, NEB® introduced its Passion in Science Awards, to recognize those within the scientific community working to solve many of today’s challenges. This was our chance to recognize the accomplishments of the “unsung heroes” of the laboratory, who are dedicated to their cause.  We are pleased to have offered the Passion in Science Awards again in 2016, in the following four award categories:

2016 Science Mentorship and Advocacy Winners
“Nothing inspires me more than nature and the notion that we are still learning things about the natural world everyday. became an educator to share this with anyone can reach; and my lab group comes in each day knowing they will be part of the discovery process.
“It's no secret that we are experiencing a global biodiversity crisis. At the same time, our young people are more inclined to interact with a touch screen than the forest on the other side of it. We can't afford not to find ways to show them that they are surrounded by a world of wonder.”
Chris Martine
Outreach and Mentoring in Botany
Chris works to reinvigorate student’s interest in botany through non-traditional methods in order to reveal the rich biodiversity that often goes unappreciated. self-identified Botanist, Chris is also interested in multiple subdisciplines of organismal plant biology, including: ecology, evolution/systematics, reproductive biology, and biodiversity/taxonomy. This has manifested in a holistic approach to discovery - where students can receive training in everything from field- and greenhouse-based methods to genetic and computer-based analyses. Chris embraces methods to reach out the public - including social media and creating, producing, and hosting the YouTube series, "Plants are Cool, Too!"
“Gender and racial diversity in are important for future endeavors. Creating young women who are passionate about and dedicated to science will help build a strong and well-rounded workforce in the future. The girls’ enthusiasm and ‘ah-ha’ moments remind us of why we love science and fulfill our desire to help others.”
Amanda Munson
Inspiring Young Women in STEM
(Genomic Opportunities for Girls In Research Labs) is an educational outreach program for high school girls designed to demystify genomics, a discipline notoriously intimidating to young scientists, thus empowering them to consider a career in the biomedical sciences. Participants learn the principles behind the science and techniques commonly used in forensic and research laboratories, and also gain hands-on experience using state-of-the-art equipment. By utilizing their own to explore scientific questions, participants become personally invested in the experiments. The participants self-identify for this all-female genomics program, creating a low pressure, energized and fun atmosphere. The program also provides participants with multiple levels of female mentorship and exposure to career possibilities in the biomedical field.
“provides authentic science experiences, while creating comfort with interdisciplinary notions, such that those disinterested in science see gateways towards better public understanding.”
David Ng

is the educational unit of the Michael Smith Laboratories (MSL) at and carries out the vision of the founding Director, Dr. Michael Smith (1993 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry) by providing teaching, outreach and science advocacy with local, national and international impact. As the Director, David works to provide hands-on science field trip experiences to students from grades 5 to 12, lead science and engineering workshops and conferences, and drives development of science education tools and their creative use of social media to promote science literacy. is also active in researching the effectiveness of various facets of its programming. This includes looking at the divide between children’s impressions of science versus creativity; gender equity challenges in uptake of careers in innovations; and the effectiveness of using games in STEM.
“If two species can work in a manner that's mutually beneficial and evolutionarily advantageous to one another, why can't people do the same thing? decided to take on Biota and try it out. want students, scientists, artists, and community members to know that we all have the power to thrive.”
Sabah Ul-Hasan
Biota
Biota is a scientific documentary series with the aim of improving engagement between scientists, artists, and the general public. The series draws parallels between symbiotic relationships (mutualism, parasitism, commensalism) and how people interact with each other and their environment. Biota employs young professionals from all different backgrounds across the globe, whose skill sets range from videography and science to social media. They also take in and mentor undergraduate students so that they can gain valuable work experience for the job market. The first season of Biota centers on the 10 bioregions in California, creating accessibility to science for viewers.
2016 Humanitarian Duty Winners
“My vision is to be able to expand to a global scale and enable individuals to realise the importance of clean water, and also be able to provide themselves with the means to access this.”
Karishma Bhagani
Matone de Chiwit
Matone de Chiwit is an aspiring social enterprise that aims to provide access to clean drinking water through a locally–sourced, all–natural water purification unit, for communities around the city of Mombasa in Kenya and eventually the world. The name Matone de Chiwit means drops of life, and is derived from three languages, from the continents that suffer most from water scarcity in the world; Africa (Kiswahili), Latin America (Spanish) and Asia (Thai), respectively. The name of the project provides an insight into the aspirations of creating a venture to provide clean drinking water to rural communities around the world.
“Instrumental Access represents opportunity: the opportunity for talented people, no matter where they are in the world, to pursue their scientific ambitions and put their talents to work. Disease pandemics, hunger and malnutrition, natural disasters - these are threats to the whole world. To meet them, we must ensure the scientific workforce that tackles them is also global, that it can collaborate regardless of geographic distance and has the right tools everywhere that they are needed.”
Nina Dudnik
Instrumental Access
The goal of Instrumental Access is to remove a key barrier to scientific discovery and education in the developing world: lack of access to modern equipment. By making affordable, high-quality lab equipment available to scientists in developing countries, those scientists are able to participate fully in the global scientific community, competing successfully for funding and other resources, and generating real results in research and education. Strong science is ultimately self-sustaining, with virtually limitless potential to impact health, economic development, environmental protection, food security, and many other areas. Equipment is also necessary to provide hands-on training for the next generation of researchers, healthcare professionals, engineers, and teachers.
“African scientists are eager to participate in the local and global generation of scientific knowledge, but they are lagging behind, finding it difficult to interact with the western scientific community in many cases. My project is helping to bridge this gap by empowering through mentorship of African scientists and by opening communication channels with their colleagues worldwide.”
Lucia Prieto Godino
TRein Africa
In 2011, Lucia founded the not-for-profit organization TRein Africa with the goal to promote science research and education in the African continent. This is accomplished through intensive, hands-on science courses for African scientists, equipment donations, development of inexpensive scientific equipment and tools, and encouraging international collaboration and educational outreach throughout Africa. These activities have already benefitted over 200 scientists in 21 African countries.
“This project has developed out of the basic science that my lab has driven for over 25 years. We are now seeing the evolution of that work into an application that could have enormous benefit for people that have no alternatives. This desire to have real world impact drives me and all of the people that work together on this project.”
Scott O’Neill
Eliminate Dengue
Scott works to develop approaches to controlling Aedes transmitted arbovirus infections of humans (e.g., dengue, Zika, chikungunya, yellow fever) by introducing Wolbachia infections into mosquito vector populations in disease endemic areas of the world. The program is committed to transferring the technology to disease endemic countries through partnerships with locally led project teams. Scott believes the impact on disease should be very large and could potentially eliminate transmission of these viruses.
2016 Environmental Stewardship Winners
“sustainable future is not only about developing biofuels or renewable products, it is equally about education in sustainable practice. Importantly, there is an education and engagement factor, bringing in students to learn about the life cycle of products, and creating an environment of good practice in the lab.”
Lisa Anderson
Greening the Lab
An advocate for educating scientists on sustainable practices in the lab, Lisa was responsible for recruiting a team in the Chemical Engineering Department to launch a laboratory glove-recycling program. This program was stimulated by her previous experiences and the Green Lab initiative. In a lab waste audit at the University of Washington, 22% of laboratory waste stemmed from laboratory gloves. Based on a pilot study in the Brushett Lab, 200 Chemical Engineering researchers could divert up to 600 lbs of gloves from landfills in as little as 4 months. Lisa’s program aligns well with the department’s overall sustainability initiatives. Collected uncontaminated gloves are “upcycled” into materials such as outdoor chairs and park benches.
“Some countries have so much plastic waste, but they still import oil. Imagine if they have know-how to obtain energy from their waste. The world will change!”
Lucy Lahrita
Hokkaido University, Sapporo, Japan
From Waste to Energy
Annually about 50,000–75,000 tons of non-recycled plastic waste in Japan cannot be recovered by existing mechanical recycling techniques. With high demand for fossil fuel in Japan, there is incentive to recover and recycle plastic waste into crude oil. Lisa’s project aims to generate synthetic diesel fuel from unused, non-recycled plastic waste using pyrolysis. This represents an economical and eco-friendly way to solve plastics waste problem in Japan, while producing cost-effective liquid fuel with properties similar to fossil fuel.
“Having clean and safe water sources is one of the greatest challenges facing the world today. Through my experiences, have discovered the magnificent array of microorganisms that unleash amazing enzymes to biodegrade harmful compounds in our environment. Although these microbes are only micron in size, they hold great potential to advance modern technology.”
Alexandra Polasko
Bugs to the Rescue
One in two people in the United States use groundwater as their primary source of drinking water; however, 22% of this water is severely contaminated. Many of the contaminants found in groundwater are probable or known carcinogens. Bioremediation employs microbes to degrade a wide variety of emerging contaminants, such as 1,4-dioxane, chlorinated solvents, and oils, using cost effective and environmentally sustainable techniques. There is limited kinetic and mechanistic understanding of the effects of these pollutants on the success of native/engineered microbes to clean the water. Alexandra’s research involves development of a low cost, rapid indicator test to select and quantify the bacteria responsible for degrading hazardous organic contaminants in the presence of toxic metals. These tools will aid in the development of a microbial community that can quickly biodegrade water contaminants.
2016 Arts and Creativity Winners
“decided to take on this project when visited the in 2013 and saw only one picture of bacteria, as a very small part within the Woods exhibit. This led to an intense brainstorm as thought to myself, “How can this be? The natural history of Earth is almost all microbes!”
Scott Chimileski
Microbiophilia
Scott works to unite photography, writing and microbiology to communicate science to general audiences. He is currently spearheading an exhibit on microbes to open at the Harvard Museum of Natural History (HMNH). Scott is also writing a book with Roberto Kolter for Harvard Univ. Press entitled Life at the Edge of Sight, that uses photography to capture the beauty, natural history and value of microbes. Lastly, Scott engages in multiple forms of media to spread the message that microbes are beautiful creatures that do far more good than harm.
“The way that people of all ages, ethnicities, gender identities pick up our zines and their eyes widen as they read them drives us to succeed. have found confidence in this method of science communication and know firsthand the difference that one small, but riveting booklet can make for a science enthusiast.”
Christine Liu
Two Photon Art
Two Photon microscopy is a technique that allows deeper brain imaging compared to traditional single photon imaging. Christine co-founded the Two Photon Art collective in order to bring together science and art, and to allow a greater understanding of science for wider audiences. The primary focus has been on creating zines which are independently published booklets. The zine community is extremely diverse and emphasizes creating safe spaces for people who have traditionally been marginalized. Science enthusiasts of all ages have picked up her zines and learned something new.
“Through the process of making and showing the films, have had the great joy of working with many equally passionate people, many of whom also grappled with choosing between their loves of art and science. For all of the people involved, it was a fantastic labor of love.”
Will Ryan
Animating Ecology
In an effort to encourage college students and the general public to engage with primary scientific literature, Will led a small group of animators in making four films. Each film focused on one foundational scientific paper in the field of Ecology and served to introduce the scientist(s), the findings in the paper and its importance to the field. They used a 'school house rock' sense of style and humor to make the videos as fun and engaging, as they were accurate and informative. The videos have since been shown at two scientific conferences to delighted crowds, but more importantly have been used in both K-12 and university classrooms across the country (all are freely available online) to both introduce concepts and to help students see that science is a very human endeavor, built upon the imagination and labor of individual people, each pursuing the threads of their own curiosity.
“Science and art are sometimes thought of as opposing disciplines that attract opposite personalities. use my project to demonstrate that people who view themselves as scientists can learn to appreciate and get involved with the arts, and people who view themselves as creative and artistic can appreciate the beautiful patterns created by nature and science.”
Dana Simmons
The Purkinje Pattern
Dana creates art that features images of live neurons, photographed during her research experiments. These neurons, called Purkinje cells, reside in the cerebellum at the back of the brain. Purkinje cells are the most complexly branched neurons in the nervous system. In fact, the shape of a Purkinje cell is strikingly similar to the branches of a tree. To create art with these neurons, she fill one single neuron with fluorescent dye using patch-clamp electrophysiology and calcium imaging. Dana then shine lasers on the dye and observes how it moves through the neuron. By watching the dye move, she can visualize the electrical currents moving through the neuron. Once the dye has diffused into all the tiny neuronal branches, she takes a three-dimensional image of the neuron using a confocal microscope and applies color filters to the neuron and the background brain tissue.
2014 Inspiration in Science Award Winners
“Passion in Science is a desire, a want to do well in science and do something that will benefit society, benefit health in the long term. Passion is being happy and enjoying your work and doing a good job.”
Laurie Doering
Astrocytes in Autism
“love letting my students know that at the end of the day, when you find something, you might be the only person in the universe that knows that fact!”
Jason Furrer
Inspire by Teaching
Teaching 500 undergraduates per year in a Microbiology course is no small feat, but Jason manages to do just that. Each semester, he offers opportunities for undergrads to participate in his research lab, regardless of their previous training or skill level. The undergraduate training program has never turned a student away, and accepts as many as 10 students per semester. Jason expects that the students will carry their training forward with them, and develop an understanding for how research connects with their chosen profession. At present, approximately 1 program graduate applies to and joins the Ph.program at the University – talk about a return on investment! They’re doing this without funding, so an integral part of the training is how to answer complex research questions on a budget. The lab’s research focus is on the pathogenesis of Crohn’s disease.
“It is inspirational to see how hard they [teachers] work and how much they care. It is so exciting to be able to help them with equipment funds, work with them on curriculum and share our work with their students. am driven to succeed, because know our program makes a difference in the education and life of young people.”
Whitney Hagins
200 and Counting
MassBioEd supports science and biotechnology education in Massachusetts through educational programs, workforce development, and lifelong learning. BioTeach has provided educational programs to over 200 high schools. Through equipment grants, teacher professional development, college and career exploration opportunities BioTeach strives to encourage student interest in life sciences. As the BioTeach mentor, Whitney is responsible for developing the biotechnology curriculum, planning and leading the professional development workshops and going into schools to do the on site mentoring. The mentoring includes lab preparation, use of equipment, co-teaching classes and labs, and course development. Her passion is for the teaching of science, and through this program she has discovered a way to really make a difference.
"Passion in science will move our understanding forward because it's the passionate people who achieve things, who make discoveries. It's what got us to the moon. It's what makes people discover things all the time.”
Ite Laird-Offringa
Norris Cancer Center, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA
Fighting Lung Cancer
Tackling lung cancer in many ways, Ite’s lab studies the epigenetic changes underlying lung cancer development and progression, focusing on methylation. Methylated (a.k.a., epigenetically-modified DNA) has the potential to yield targets for treatment and potential molecular markers that could enable early diagnosis, therapy response monitoring and recurrence detection. recent finding, which improves the sensitivity of detecting methylated in patient blood (patent pending), will soon be developed into a commercially-available technology. Ite’s laboratory is also studying the epigenomes of alveolar epithelial cells, the putative progenitors of the most common lung cancer subtype, adenocarcinoma. Meanwhile, the cancer-associated immune response to small cell lung cancer, the most aggressive form of lung cancer, is also being studied to leverage patient immune response for the development for tools.
“My students are [the] source of my energy and enthusiasm. They remind me everyday why chose this profession. am always so grateful that they chose to spend part of their life journey with me. want to make sure that leave a lasting and positive impact on them and hope that they would pay it forward.”
Kalai Mathee
Florida International University, Miami, FL
Mathee Lab for 65 Roses
The name of Kalai’s laboratory might make you think that they specialize in horticulture, but the name is actually a mondegreen for cystic fibrosis, coined by 5-year old patient, Richard Weiss. The laboratory’s primary focus is the pathogenicity of certain bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and their resistance to antibiotic treatment. Ultimately, these bacteria lead to the demise of patients with CF, making a better understanding of their pathogenicity critical to the effective treatment of patients. In an effort to find a better way to treat patients with these infections, the lab searches for botanicals for treatment and alternative drug targets.
2014 Humanitarian Duty Award Winners
“Mothers often tell me ‘Now have a place to go and pray’ or ‘Now have a place to be with my son or daughter.’ It seems invaluable to provide resolution for a family and to restore dignity to each individual by giving them back their identity.”
Lori Baker
Reuniting Families
The more than 6,000 deaths of unauthorized immigrants on the southern border in the last 15 years, were a story that Lori wasn’t able to ignore. In Texas, remains are often buried in unmarked graves without any forensic analysis. She founded the Reuniting Families Project (RFP) in 2003 to identify and return these international migrants to their families. Each summer she takes forensic teams to exhume pauper graves in towns along the border. In the last two years alone, her team has recovered 164 individuals. They perform a forensic analysis to determine biological profile, look for signs of trauma, take samples for DNA, stable isotope and elemental analyses, and enter the case into missing person’s databases. Lori has created the Repository of Unidentified Remains to ensure that no one is buried and forgotten. To date, her efforts have repatriated nearly 70 individuals.
"Serving as chair of the Committee on Chemists with Disabilities and on the Committee on Equal Opportunities in Science and Engineering helped me realize the lack of resources and active leadership directed to students with disabilities.”
Karl Booksh
Disabilities in STEM
Karl works to prepare students with disabilities for leadership positions in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM). He leads a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program for students with disabilities at the University of Delaware. The goal is to better prepare the students to pursue a graduate degree in Each student is matched with a faculty and a graduate student mentor, and the students work for 8 weeks on their own project in a team-oriented environment. Career development seminars cover topics such as graduate school/advisor selection, strategies for disability disclosure, and presentation of research in public forums among other topics. The students present their research at the annual conference and at the American Chemical Society (ACS) National Conference where the students also attend networking sessions for undergraduate researchers.
"It’s incredibly inspiring how many scientists step outside the lab to do brilliant, creative things in the arts or for humanitarian causes."
Peter Hotez
NTDs
Peter helped establish the concept of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), a group of 17 parasitic and bacterial infections that infect more than one billion people around the world, most of whom live on less than $1.25 per day. Without treatment, NTDs can lead to malnutrition, blindness, physical disabilities and even death. Recognizing the need to effectively address NTDs, he co-developed the “rapid impact package” of essential medicines that simultaneously targeted seven of the most common NTDs. Peter also led the Sabin Vaccine Institute Product Development Partnership (Sabin PDP) – a non-profit business model that brings together partners from across the globe to develop new, low-cost vaccines for NTDs. In this role, he led the development of the first human hookworm vaccine, now in clinical trials -- a project he launched as an MD/Phstudent in the 1980s!
"Immense possibilities for good lie within each of us. As scientists, we often have unique opportunities to apply what we know to shine a light on local and global issues. We only need to find the energy and courage to make a difference.”
Paul McDonald
Army Suicide
Paul acted as one of three primary authors and the only scientific advisor to the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army to provide insight into Army policy and practices that were resulting in high-risk behavior, including suicide. This work resulted in two separate Army publications, the first of which made national news. By accessing diverse Army databases, and identifying metrics that could indicate tractable data to identify high-risk individuals, the Task Force was able to make over 280 specific policy recommendations for the improvement of surveillance and detection of high-risk behavior, and for the first time, identify specific trends in high-risk populations.
2014 Environmental Stewardship Award Winners
“am interested [in being an] environmentalist because see the environment where live, where the environment is polluted by pollution; by water pollution; by waste, excessive waste generation around my home. So when did my graduate study think…what can do in my research to contribute to the society.”
Tonni Kurniawan
Novel Method
Recently, Surabaya (Indonesia) has successfully confronted a municipal solid waste (MSW) problem through its partnership with Kitakyushu (Japan). Under Tonni’s leadership, the innovative Takakura Home Composting (THC) method was adapted to reduce waste generation at home. Normally, conventional composters need three months to decompose organic waste. With the device, organic waste from the kitchen is transformed into compost within 72 hours, without releasing unpleasant odors, and attracting flies or encouraging the development of fungi. By turning waste into compost, could be decoupled from economic growth. Since the implementation of the method, Surabaya has reduced about 30% of organic waste annually at the city level and about 7,000 tons of CO2 eq. emissions could be avoided. The resulting compost is used for beautifying the local environment. As one of the environmental facilitators, Tonni was involved in educating housewives.
“have always been uncomfortable with the large volume of trash generate while carrying out my research. This project has allowed me to reverse some of the environmental damage my profession creates, while also inspiring undergraduates to look at waste streams as a potential asset.”
Andrew Markley
Styrofoam Box Reuse
Expanded polystyrene (EPS, also known as Styrofoam®) has a low consumer-recycling rate due to its high transportation costs. In 2012, Andrew had the idea of collecting boxes on campus and reusing them locally. Together, with the Office of Sustainability, they applied for and received over $100,000 in funding for an undergraduate team to set up this system. In a year went from no campus recycling to collection sites in 26 buildings, reusing or recycling close to a semi truck load monthly. Now, the university resells boxes (as well as packing peanuts and gel packs) through the campus surplus store, and provides boxes to biotech companies for reshipment. The rest is delivered to a local recycler. The hope is to use funds received by selling boxes to make campus collection financially self-sustainable. Success with the program has led to Andrew replicating this program at 2 other universities.
2014 Arts and Creativity Award Winners
“Cancer is one of the worst words we can think of. The word draws a strong emotional reaction, since many of us know someone who has or had cancer. But as scientists working with cancer cells, we find them fascinating…Making these images allowed me to create something beautiful to share my experiences with others in a positive way.”
Tal Danino
Colonies
In collaboration with artist Vik Muniz, known for his garbage-art project in the academy-award nominated film Waste Land, Tal’s piece “ Colonies ” offers a way to think about cancer research. While at MIT, Tal developed a technology to micropattern living bacteria and cancer cells, transforming them into living artwork. Vik captured images, which Tal then patterned and captured in high resolution on a microscope. They would then print these images at a wall-sized scale, where one could see both the individual cells as well the image as a whole. Interesting pairings between material and image were made into a series named ‘Colonies’ that has been used to raise awareness on bacteria-based cancer technologies, and generate proceeds that are donated back to cancer research.
“always see arts and science as being two sides of the same coin. You have to look at the world from different perspectives, and what you're trying to do is describe the world to other people. Whether that's in peer reviewed publications or whether it's in an expression of art, it's going to be your interpretation of a particular topic.”
Louise Hughes
3printed Electron Microscopy
personal interest in 3printing and making jewelry items out of microscopy data led Louise to consider the value of 3printing in bringing microscopy to a group of people not normally able to access it -- those who are visually impaired. Being able to see microscopic structure is a fundamental aspect of understanding biology and, without it, our understanding of cells and tissues would be far behind what we know today. Using 3electron microscopy techniques she imaged and modeled miniature structures, from viruses to cell organelles to parasitic organisms that cause human disease. She then converted these models into printing plans for 3printers. She has generated sculptures of these structures that are several million times their normal size. Louise has exhibited the 3prints, to share these fascinating miniature worlds with those with visual impairments.
“My creativity in and out of the lab has inspired many young scientists to look at science with an uncommon lens, resulting in an engagement and connection they never kscience could offer.”
Alia Qatarneh
Science Raps & More
Alia’s work as a Research Assistant for the Life Sciences Outreach Program at Harvard has allowed her to interact with hundreds of high school students and their science teachers in the area. Although there is no formal project at hand, her artistic ways have connected with her academic science focus, resulting in a cross-disciplinary approach to better learning. Alia has created science-themed shirts to raise money for the Children's School of Science in Woods Hole. She has also created science songs/raps that take foundational biology topics (like and mitosis) out of a standard textbook and onto iPods across England. Her creativity in and out of the lab has inspired many young scientists to look at science with an uncommon lens, resulting in an engagement and connection they never kscience could offer.
“An art project or a science project all start with a curiosity, a question, and we all go through the same process of fun and excitement and sometimes frustration, and then ultimately we reach that product that we're looking for.”
Shelly Xie
Neglected Parasites
Shelly’s project combined art and science to tell stories about people who are affected by neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Through touching sand-art performances , she exposed the daily struggle of people living in endemic areas, and the toll that NTDs take on the infected and their families. Her work on Schistosomiasis tells a story of a mother and her daughter in Ghana, and how the disease affects their daily lives. The hookworm story describes the influence of hookworm infection on the quality of life, education and earning potential of the family in an eastern Brazilian village, causing an endless cycle of poverty and disease. The piece based on Chagas disease emphasizes the importance of preventive measures, such as bed nets and vaccine development, in saving millions of lives, as well as helping the local economies in the Americas. The project shines a light on the struggle of those who live in the endemic areas, expanding public knowledge of the diseases, and encouraging people to take action toward eliminating the diseases.
