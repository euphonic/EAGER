There's an optimism that comes with looking five or ten years ahead—to the ideas that signal the                       future. Our deep partnerships with innovative technology companies keep tomorrow’s innovations                       on track.
How We Do It
We inhabit two worlds: one that's nanometers in scale and one that's global. This micro                       and macro view gives us a unique perspective. We see electrons wave and industries transform.                       When you put deep science together with optimism, big things happen.
Expertise
Last year we invested over $600 million in R&That's a measure of our commitment to                           solving the most daunting technical challenges. From our ground-breaking mask inspection                           tool in 1975 that signaled the dawn of semiconductor process control, to today's broadband                           plasma technology that discovers defects at the speed of light, we like to arrive first.
Collaboration
Active collaboration multiplies agile thinking. We put this approach into practice at                           strategic, technical and operational levels with our partners. Working side-by-side both                           geographically and intellectually, we maximize discovery and solutions.
Operations
We have a proven ability to go from concept to global marketplace. We invent in-house, make                           strategic acquisitions and share technology across systems to diversify our perspectives                           and widen the range of our solutions. Comprehensive service programs keep it all optimized.
Foundation
We support a range of community and charitable initiatives with funding and volunteer                       opportunities: education, health and wellness programs, local aid and international                       disaster relief. We sponsor the Second Harvest Food Bank in Santa Clara County and fight river                       blindness in Africa. Not for profit, just for humanity.

你想访问KLA中国吗？Our stylus and optical profilers offer a complete range of surface metrology capabilities to meet the needs of the engineering and research communities. The profilers take measurement to the next level, starting with step height, texture and stress analysis.
Alpha-Step D-500 Stylus Profiler
Alpha-Step D-500 Stylus Profiler
The Alpha-Step D-500 stylus profiler is capable of measuring 2step heights from a few nanometers to 1200µm. It also supports 2measurements of roughness, bow and stress for R&and production environments.
Alpha-Step D-600 Stylus Profiler
Alpha-Step D-600 Stylus Profiler
The Alpha-Step D-600 stylus profiler is capable of measuring 2and 3step heights from a few nanometers to 1200µm. It also supports 2and 3measurements of roughness, plus 2bow and stress for R&and production environments.
P-7 Stylus Profiler
P-7 Stylus Profiler
The P-7 builds on the success of the market leading P-17 benchtop stylus profiling system. It includes the superior measurement performance of the P-17 technology in a platform that offers a great price-to-features ratio for a benchtop stylus profiler. The P-7 offers step height measurement capability for steps from a few nanometers to one millimeter, for production and R&environments.
P-17 Stylus Profiler

The P-170 is a cassette-to-cassette stylus profiler combining the P-17's industry leading benchtop system measurement performance with the HRP®-260's production proven handler. This combination offers a great price-to-performance ratio for a handler-based system serving the semiconductor, compound semiconductor and related industries.
The MicroXAM-800 optical profiler is a non-contact, 3surface topography measurement system. The MicroXAM’s white light interferometer supports phase and vertical scanning interferometry to measure features from nanometers to millimeters.
Zeta-20 Optical Profiler
Zeta-20 Optical Profiler
The Zeta-20 benchtop optical profiler is a non-contact, 3surface topography measurement system. The system is powered by patented ZDot™ technology and Multi-Mode optics, enabling measurement of a variety of samples: transparent and opaque, low to high reflectance, smooth to rough texture, and step heights from nanometers to millimeters.
The Zeta-300 optical profiler is a non-contact, 3surface topography measurement system. The system incorporates integrated isolation options and configuration flexibility to handle larger samples. The Zeta-300 is powered by patented ZDot™ technology and Multi-Mode optics, enabling measurement of a variety of samples: transparent and opaque, low to high reflectance, smooth to rough texture, and step heights from nanometers to millimeters.
Zeta-388 Optical Profiler
Zeta-388 Optical Profiler
The Zeta-388 benchtop optical profiler is a non-contact, 3surface topography measurement system. The system is powered by patented ZDot™ technology and Multi-Mode optics, enabling measurement of a variety of samples: transparent and opaque, low to high reflectance, smooth to rough texture, and step heights from nanometers to millimeters.
