Low Profile Flood Lights
Low Profile Flood Lights

Low profile flood lights provide the same advantages as regular flood lights but in a more compact design. With a lifespan over 50,000 hours and unmatched efficiency, low profile flood lights have become a very popular replacement for halogen and flood lights. The use of specialized optics and reflectors also allows more control over the lights which means light can be more easily directed where it’s needed most!Low profile flood lights are made to operate in harsh conditions and consequently have good protection against fine dust and water particles with an IP65+ protection rating. We supply a broad range of top quality floodlights from reputable brands so with us, you’re guaranteed to find the ideal floodlight for your budget and requirements!
