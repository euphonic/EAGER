Board
Research, Inc. (AR) is a leading independent developer and manufacturer of pressure-sensitive (PSAs), polymers, tapes, films, coatings, laminates, 
release liners
 and drug delivery systems.
We are committed to being the most effective company in our field by:
Partnering with our customers
Developing and manufacturing the specialized products our customers seek for improving their product.
Established in 1961, AR’s humble beginnings originated in a converted garage to develop and supply specialty adhesive-coated materials and processing equipment to meet the evolving needs of the graphics arts label market.
Through several moves and expansions, grew steadily, developing new capabilities and technologies that enabled the company to address the unmet needs of new markets. Rapid growth led to facility expansions to include the U.S., South America (1980), Europe (1999) and Asia (2000). With headquarters in Glen Rock, and Limerick, Ireland, today the company’s facilities span over 250 acres, cover over 300,000+ square feet of development and manufacturing space and employ approximately 300 associates.
Research, Inc. is organized into two unique businesses:
 supplies high-performance specialty films, PSAs, tapes, coatings, films, laminates and components to the medical, pharmaceutical, electronics, industrial, and splicing markets
ARx, LLC
, a wholly-owned subsidiary, develops and manufactures client-specific transdermal and thin film drug delivery systems with pharmaceutical and biotech partners.
During the past 50+ years, has emerged as a leader in our field through the continuous development of core technologies and capabilities. Today we remain an independent company, committed to working with customers as our partners in the development of application-specific products that fill their unmet material needs.
