Perfect Partnership
Our sponsorship of the team has already seen great success in an event that made its Games debut in the winter of 1964. Erin Hamlin was the first American to win a medal in the Luge Singles in Sochi in 2014, taking home a bronze. The success of the team and our partnership was further reinforced in PyeongChang when Chris Mazdzer broke another record, becoming the first man to win a silver medal in the Luge Men’s Singles.
But it wasn’t the team’s success that convinced us to extend our sponsorship. As the action and medal winning performances in PyeongChang drew to a close, we had already demonstrated our commitment to the team, having signed a contract to prolong our partnership with the Luge team by another four years. We will continue to back the team as the main sponsor through to the Beijing Games in February 2022.
Norton Expertise
Our collaboration began almost 40 years ago in Watervliet (New York, USA) when we donated coated abrasives  to the athletes and coaches for use in finishing the luges’ runners. We gradually increased our support over the years until in 2009 we became the team’s primary sponsor. 
For us it’s not just a question of financial support, however that does of course help! We also bring our expertise and technical assistance to work together with the team to cut fractions of seconds from the competitors’ time to improve their performance. Our experts work to enhance the sleds by reducing friction on the ice and thus increasing speed – culminating in medal wins in Sochi in 2014 and PyeongChang in 2018.
“This partnership galvanizes our teams in the who are proud to work with the national luge team. We’re pleased to continue this engagement and support them in picking up more medals in Beijing in 2022,” declared Brad Johnson, Vice President, Abrasives North America.
Norton Abrasives has been delivering premium abrasive solutions for over 130 years. We develop products that are part of your daily life whether at work or in your home as part of our dedication to Reshaping Your World. Our wealth of experience allows us to bring you powerful, precise and user-friendly solutions, whatever your application.

Abrasives has won a major contract to supply small specialty abrasive belts to Darex of Ashland, Oregon, a manufacturer of custom tool sharpening machines.
Darex is using the abrasives in its new “Work Sharp Culinary” machine, a first-of-its-kind knife sharpener targeted at the high-end residential small kitchen appliance market.  The new sharpener is scheduled for launch later this year.
“This win for was the culmination of more than 12 months of cross functional teamwork between us and Darex,” says Pete Perzan, account manager.  “This included R&and application engineering teams working on belt design, the production team on custom back printing, and the sales team on contract negotiation.”
“We won the business through the dedicated effort of their R&team and our engineering group,” adds Pat Baliva, area sales director.  “Work Sharp Culinary is unique because the belt runs very slow and we had to engineer the joint and sandpaper backing so that the knife edge didn’t catch on it.  We created a custom product which fit their application well. The only place consumers can get the replacement belt is from Darex, so we not only lock up the orders for the new machines but all the replenishment tooling as well.”
manufactures materials for Darex from sandpaper jumbo rolls made in Watervliet, New York, which are then converted (cut to size) in Tijuana, Mexico.
Darex is a manufacturer of industrial bit sharpeners and in addition to the Darex brand owns Work Sharp Tools, which creates knife and tool sharpeners, and Drill Doctor, which creates hobbyist drill bit sharpeners.
