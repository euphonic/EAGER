"Most side effects of radiotherapy, including radiotherapy delivered with systems, are mild and temporary, often involving fatigue, nausea, and skin irritation. Side effects can be severe, however, leading to pain, alterations in normal body functions (for example, urinary or salivary function), deterioration of quality of life, permanent injury and even death. Side effects can occur during or shortly after radiation treatment or in the months and years following radiation. The nature and severity of side effects depend on many factors, including the size and location of the treated tumor, the treatment technique (for example, the radiation dose), the patient‚Äôs general medical condition, to name a few.

The Department of Energy explored this concept through the Aquatic Species Program (ASP) from the late 1970s until 1996.  When the program ended, oil was ~$20/barrel, making renewable energy generally, and algae-derived fuels in particular, uneconomic.  The concluded that producing biofuels from microalgae was feasible; however technology at that time did not allow for economic viability.",1
