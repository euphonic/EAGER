Collaboration
Partners of Partners of Creating innovations is a matter of working together, and that requires partners. That is why, every year, we team up with some 3,000 large multinationals, SMEs, universities and public-sector organisations within and outside the Netherlands to tackle challenges.
For us, working in partnerships is the obvious choice. Each individual partner has a particular focus, and their qualities complement those of Universities create new knowledge, for example. We focus on the application of that knowledge, and companies implement the innovations that are realised with it.
Our sister organisations
Our sister organisations that specialise in knowledge application are important partners. In the Netherlands, they are:
in the field of food and biobased research,
in the field of defence and safety,
in the field of energy,
Deltares in the field of building and urban development in delta areas
Marin in the field of maritime research.
In Europe we frequently work with
Fraunhofer in the field of industry,
in the field of technology,
in the field of industry
We help these organisations to realise their ambitions, and they help us to realise ours.
Are you looking for an innovation partner? Can you help us with innovations? To find out more about the subjects we focus on, you can explore our website or contact us directly.

About Mission and strategy
Mission and strategy
connects people and knowledge to create innovations that boost the competitive strength of industry and the well-being of society in a sustainable way. This is our mission and it is what drives us, the over 3,200 professionals at TNO, in our work every day. We work in collaboration with partners and focus on nine domains.
About is an independent research organisation. We believe in the joint creation of economic and social value. We focus on transitions or changes in nine social themes:
Buildings, Infrastructure & Maritime : 'Robust constructions, sustainable use'
The Circular Economy and the Environment: 'Directing and accelerating sustainability'
Defence, Safety and Security: ‘We’re putting our knowledge and technology to work for safety and security’
Energy: ‘Faster towards a sustainable energy supply'
Healthy living: ‘Focussing on participation, not on the disease’
Industry: ‘Innovating for employment, welfare and well-being’
Information & Communication Technology: 'Interpreting and accelerating digital transformation'
Strategic Analysis & Policy: 'Turning complex issues into concrete innovations'
Traffic and Transport: 'Helping to create liveable, sustainable cities'
Innovation with purpose is what stands for. We develop knowledge not for its own sake, but for practical application.
Our mission
connects people and knowledge to create innovations that boost the competitive strength of industry and the well-being of society in a sustainable way.
Our strategy
Every four years, in close collaboration with our stakeholders, we draw up a strategic plan that describes how we will pursue our mission. This plan is our proposal to society. Our strategy is a reflection of the trends we observe in society and technology. In close coordination with our stakeholders we have defined five domains on which we will focus. These are in line with the challenges and ambitions of the Top Sector policy and social themes in the Netherlands and the rest of Europe.
Further information
If you would like further information about a domain or a specific subject, select a relevant focus area, then select a subject and you will receive information about which a researcher can tell you more about it. 
If your area of interest cannot be easily delineated, then look under areas current subjects or use the search engine on our homepage.
If you would like to know how works, take a look at ‘
How We Work
’.

Caribbean is based in Aruba and has been operating in the Caribbean since 2011, with a specific focus on sustainable energy and clean technology. Caribbean employs a local workforce that understands the Caribbean island setting and culture. Caribbean is supported by its Dutch mother organization TNO, a top tier European independent R&and knowledge institute with a track record of over 75 years. employs some 2500 highly qualified professionals to provide in depth expertise to develop and implement innovations and provide independent expert advice on all aspects of sustainable development. sets itself apart with its multi-disciplinary expertise which covers the entire spectrum of technology, economic analysis, policy and regulation.
Caribbean Services
We recognize that each island and rural region has its own unique set of circumstances and constraints within which a solution needs to be created. Caribbean’s service offerings were created with this in mind. We aim to work with the local stakeholders and decision makers to assess the problem and determine a desired outcome. From there we draft a strategy, identify which information we need in order to make informed decisions and help convene stakeholders to build the required support and buy-in for implementation. We can serve you in a number of ways:
Independent strategy advice & techno-economic evaluations
Process facilitation & project and program management services
Capacity building through (custom) training and seminars.
Market research and social adoption
Environmental and Social Economic Assessment
Caribbean-Aruba Partnership
In 2011 Aruba and established a long-term partnership to assist Aruba in its sustainable island transition and establish the island as a regional and Small islands Developing States (SIDS) knowledge hub. Since then has worked with the government of Aruba and its stakeholders on the development of its sustainable energy transition strategy and the development of the Smart Community, the Caribbean’s first sustainable community. This community serves as a living lab and sustainable development demonstration project.
The Sustainable Energy Transition Summit has proven to be a critical step in helping Aruba move forward. It enabled us to take a strategic approach to our energy transition, ensuring all efforts are aligned and working towards a shared goal. – Mr. Mike Eman, Prime Minister Aruba

About International
Middle East
Middle East

                        is a Dutch company and one of Europe’s largest independent organizations in the area of new technology development and technical consultancy. In 2011 opened its Middle East office in the Qatar Science and Technology Park (QSTP) with a focus on the oil & gas industry. TNO's Middle East office serves as a regional hub to develop and execute projects in the Middle East.
                    
With a Qatar branch office we are working in close interaction with local energy parties, and to support and expand our long-term relations with companies and universities in the Middle East. Our current focus in the Middle East region is the Oil & Gas sector, however we are also expanding into to other core markets of such as Water Treatment, Small Scale LNG, Critical Infrastructure Security and Greenhouses. With ongoing projects in many gulf countries we are especially active in the following areas:
Production Optimization: maximizing the production and recovery of upstream oil & gas assets
Carbon Capture and Storage: full chain of technologies to address the CO2 challenge
Gas treatment: safe and economical production of sour gas
Asset Integrity: Reliability and safety of assets focused on mechanical integrity and safe process operation conditions
Middle-East track record
Within the Middle East region we currently work together with various industrial partners, such as Saudi Aramco, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) and Kuwait Oil Company (KOC). We also work together with Universities and research centers such as Qatar University and the Petroleum Institute (Abu Dhabi). In Qatar we have a long-term collaboration with Maersk Oil Qatar, producer of the Al-Shaheen field, Qatar’s largest oil field, on increased oil recovery (IOR) for horizontal wells.

After years of cuts, the government is once again planning extra investments in applied research and with a new robust organisation and strategy, the foundation has been laid for to respond fast and effectively to new developments. This coming year will see an accent on putting this into action.
Impact
The core of what does is the realisation of impact: applying the knowledge has developed. “The multidisciplinarity of is one of our key added values in helping to solve societal challenges.” Innovation mainly occurs at the interfaces between different scientific disciplines, in long-term partnerships with underlying funding. “In 2021 wants to be the flywheel of innovation in the Netherlands. Based on the demand from society, works together with the best partners to find comprehensive solutions,” says TNO’s chief executive in the 
strategic plan

The Impact of The Impact of Effective innovation is what stands for. We don’t do that alone but with companies, governments and a whole range of organisations. Through collaboration we create innovations that sustainably strengthen the competitiveness of companies and the wellbeing of society. We develop knowledge not for its own sake but for real application.
We work on issues that concern our environment, safety and security, the energy transition, innovations in industry and how to keep the ageing population actively engaged. These are the challenges that researchers take up every day in their drive to produce impactful innovations.
Every four years we set out our vision of the future and our ambitions in a strategic plan. At the end of this period it is good to look back at the results our work has generated, largely in collaboration with partners and stakeholders. In “The Impact of TNO” we present an overview of what we have achieved in the past few years. Looking back at the period 2011-2014, you will see how relevant these topics still are today.
We hope that these examples will inspire you and we invite you to collaborate with us on tackling the transitions that face our society.
Do you want to know more about who we are, what we do, how we work and the impact of TNO? Meet in our publication '

Resilient Ship Design Course
Event
Resilient Ship Design Course 2019
Although warships have several layers of defence, history has shown a multitude of incidents where these have all failed resulting in battle damage of the ship. Much can be done in the design of the ship to provide an adequate level of resilience against anti-ship missiles, threats, shaped charges, gunfire or asymmetric threats. You can learn all about it in this course organised by Defence Research from the Netherlands.
Underwater shock trial
The course is aimed at:
- Navy personnel
- Survivability experts
- Shipyards
- Designers of naval vessels
- Naval ship manufacturing industry
- Managers of new naval projects
- Project engineers who make specifications of 
    naval equipment and installations
- Engineers who monitor naval building or

Animal testing policy
Animal testing policy
Our studies in the fields of health, food, defence, consumer safety, safety at work and environmental issues cannot always exclude the need for animal testing. This is partly as a result of legislation and partly because no viable alternatives exist. In the context of corporate social responsibility has drafted a conscientious testing policy.
The principles of TNO’s animal testing policy are: 
only carries out tests on animals if this is prescribed by law and if there are no reliable alternatives available;
makes an active contribution to the development and application of alternatives to animal testing (the three R’s: Refine, Reduce, Replace);
adheres strictly to the legal regulations and requirements.
attaches considerable importance to the intrinsic value of test animals. Ethical control is central to all experiments and proper treatment of the animal is a priority. is also an active participant in the social debate on the use of animal testing. Given its leading position in many fields of research, remains fully informed of developments in the field of animal testing that can reduce the number of animals used or contribute to improving their living conditions; is dedicated to applying these developments in its own proceedings.

Innovation for development
Innovation for development
Globally, 4 billion people live below poverty-level, mainly in developing countries. This offers a tremendous opportunity in terms of consumer markets and production capacity. In addition, it provides an opportunity to develop local entrepreneurship and poverty alleviation. creates impact at low-income groups. In public-private partnerships we develop and launch innovations with social and financial impact: ‘Inclusive Business’.
Creating Impact
Important global challenges are the growing world population, approaching 9 billion people, and increased prosperity and related living standard. This will results in a global scarcity of food, energy and resources. People with lowest incomes will be the first impacted by these issues. It’s our responsibility to develop new solutions which lead to poverty alleviation and create wealth and income generation. Business that has social and financial impact. This improves the stability and safety throughout the world.
Inclusive business
Successful innovation at low-income groups in developing countries is not a straight forward business. Innovation is required to develop successful business propositions in these low-income markets. On the one hand technical innovation for sustainable solutions in energy, ICT, nutritious food, etc. and on the other hand, innovation in business models and scaling strategies. is the innovation partner here. With technical knowhow as well as experience on business modelling and transition management we launch inclusive businesses. These inclusive businesses are market driven, social and financial sustainable for all partners.
Public private partnerships
Inclusive businesses are always developed in close collaboration with the private sector, civil society organizations, public partners, knowledge institutes and end-users. We have a good network in Africa and Asia. Currently, at least 20 projects are running ranging across the following topics:
Access to nutritious food: alternative protein sources and post-harvest technologies
Clean drinking water: purification
Health: mother and child care
Sustainable energy: decentralized electrification with solar and biogas
Mobile services: communication solutions
Sustainable production: clean and safe industrial production
Resilience: disaster risk reduction and building strong communities

Real-world vehicle emissions
Real-world vehicle emissions
Road vehicles are a major source of air pollutant emissions. This involves substances such as nitrogen oxides (NO
x
) and particulate matter (including PM10), both of which are harmful to health. Vehicle emissions must be reduced to meet European requirements for local air quality and for emissions at national level. In addition, road vehicles that run on fossil fuels emit carbon dioxide (CO
2
). CO
2
 is a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming. European legislation is setting increasingly stringent requirements on road vehicle emissions. 
The Dutch government is committed to making vehicles cleaner and more fuel-efficient. To do this, and to do this as soon as possible, the Netherlands is bringing additional instruments to bear, such as tax incentives, temporary subsidies, and environmental zones. Also, there is active Dutch involvement in Brussels, aiming to achieve effective European legislation that brings down the real-world vehicle emissions.
Objective information for supporting and monitoring policies
In designing effective emission legislation, the government has to be able to rely on objective data on emissions and other car performance parameters. has, therefore, been commissioned by the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment to measure the real-world emission performance of road vehicles. Measurements are made on a dynamometer in the lab and when driving on the road using mobile emission measuring equipment. There are two separate measurement programmes: one for passenger cars and vans and one for trucks and buses.
The aim of TNO’s measurements is twofold. Based on an average picture of real-world emissions, national road vehicle emission factors are established each year. These emission factors are used to calculate air quality, to determine total emissions, and to calculate the effectiveness of policy measures. Emission factors are always based on measurements of real-world emissions, not on the emissions reported in type-approval testing.
brings its knowledge of vehicle emissions to bear in the context of several national and international working groups that are involved in determining emission factors. In the Netherlands, that would be the Task Force on Traffic and Transportation, while at international level it is (European Research for Mobile Emission Sources) and (European In-Service Emission Conformity).
In addition, TNO’s results are an important basis for input from the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment and the Netherlands Vehicle Authority in the development of new European emission standards and related testing procedures. Accordingly, has been working with these parties in Brussels for several years, to develop legislation for real-world emissions, also known as Real Driving Emissions or This new legislation should ensure that vehicles are clean, not only on the dynamometer, but when they are out on the road as well. Legislation of this kind has already been introduced for trucks, and the beneficial results are clearly visible.
has no enforcement function. The measurement results are published, and are always discussed extensively and in depth with the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment, the car importers concerned, manufacturers, and other stakeholders such as the Association and (the Association of Car Dealers and Garage Holders).
Diesel vehicles: marked reduction in particulate matter emissions, but the NOx emissions of diesel cars and vans continues to be a point of concern
With regard to air pollutant emissions, petrol vehicles are now fitted with catalytic converters, so they have been relatively clean for quite some time. Modern cars, vans, trucks and buses that run on diesel are all equipped with closed diesel particulate filters. These provide a very significant reduction in particulate emissions from diesel vehicles.
In the case of trucks and buses, the introduction of more stringent standards, together with the addition of a real-world test to the type-approval testing procedure, has also led to substantial reductions in real-world emissions of NOx. On average, in everyday use, modern heavy Euro trucks emit just one tenth of the NOx emitted by previous generations of trucks (Euro and V).
For some years, however, has identified major and growing differences between the NOx emissions of diesel cars and vans measured during type-approval testing, and the corresponding emissions under real-world conditions. European emission limits are becoming increasingly stringent. Since 2010, these vehicles have been subject to NOx reduction measures such as exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR). Despite this, however, the real-world emissions of NOx by diesel cars and vans over the past two decades have remained virtually unchanged. As a result, the real-world emissions of modern cars and vans are substantially higher than the limits set for type-approval testing in emissions legislation.
TNO’s contribution
is helping to reduce road vehicle emissions in a variety of ways. As an independent institute, is working to generate reliable insights into real-world emissions. supports government bodies, businesses and other stakeholders in their efforts to achieve effective reductions in such emissions.
On the one hand, this involves carrying out measurement programmes, developing new measurement methods, testing new technologies, and providing objective, fact-based advice to all of the parties concerned. This work involves advising local authorities on the design of effective policies to meet current European air quality standards and on how to achieve more far-reaching targets for clean and healthy air.
In addition, is developing various technical and non-technical solutions to help reduce the environmental impact of road vehicles in real-world situations.

Animal testing policy
Policy
Our Policy
Experimental animals deserve to be optimally cared for throughout their lives. has a formal policy regarding the use of laboratory animals and the application of the 3Rs to ensure the animals receive the best possible treatment. This policy is part of TNO's 
Corporate Social Responsibility policy
 and acts as a formal guideline for management and employees. committee Animal experiments & Alternatives evaluates this policy on an annual basis and reports directly to the Board of Management.
Mission and Vision
accepts that individual animals have an intrinsic value. also endorses the view that there are circumstances that justify the use of laboratory animals. At the same time, realises that, by performing animal research, the researcher (Principle Investigator) and the Board of Management become responsible for ethical considerations and animal welfare. Animal experiments are only acceptable if no suitable alternative is available and the goal of the study outweighs the discomfort the animals may experience. Refinement, reduction and replacement (3Rs) in animal testing are leading principles. operates within the boundaries of relevant legislation and, when applicable, in compliance with quality criteria of the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care (AAALAC). dedicated, independent Animal Ethics Committee evaluates all projects involving animals. Furthermore, together with dedicated animal care staff, the Animal Welfare Body ensures an appropriate culture of care.
Although animal experiments have made progress in science and human health and welfare possible, there is a need for methods with a better substantiated predictivity for the human/patient situation. Improvement of current methodologies can be realised by implementing innovative 3methods. This thinking is anchored in our policy, research programs and communication.
Ambition
has the intention to conduct excellent biomedical research, with the aim of improving human health. To this end, various technologies are being developed and applied, both clinically and pre-clinically. Pre-clinical techniques (
in silico
, 
in vitro,
 laboratory animals) focus on the predictive value for humans.
Investment in animal-free innovation does not mean that will not carry out animal tests in the coming years. It does mean that will focus its own research resources on replacement and reduction, but certainly also on refinement. It is our ambition not only to develop new innovative 3methods, but also to accelerate acceptance and implementation of these methods. This is why we involve and collaborate with all relevant stakeholders, including academia, regulators, government and industry.
In our society, transparency and communication are essential. provides information about its actions and position in the field of animal testing in order to promote a dialogue based on mutual respect. This dialogue is strengthened by the objective exchange of information - without negatively affecting the safety of researchers and lab animals or the confidentiality of research data - and maximum transparency.
TNO's internal policy on animal testing and alternatives includes instructions on related topics such as the training of personnel, education, facilities, transparency and responsibility. In January 2018 has revised the policy on animal experiments in order to run in parallel with the strategy period (2018-2021). Click

Health
Globally, an estimated 287.000 women died during pregnancy and childbirth in 2010, a decline of 47% from levels in 1990. Causes include poor health status of women and insufficient access to skilled routine and emergency care (UN, 2012).
The maternal mortality ratio in developing regions is still 15 times higher than in the developed regions. Accelerated interventions are required in order to meet the target of the Millennium Development Goals. is focusing on mother and child care in Suriname and Africa. Beside monitoring of causes we also implement interventions. Centering Pregnancy, E-health and diagnosis on the spot are important ingredients. Extra attention is paid to the health of young woman who want to become pregnant. The basis for a healthy pregnancy is already partly in puberty, e.g. malnutrition or unhealthy lifestyles have a major impact on pregnancy. Our approach focuses also on adolescent girls. We host the secretariat for the global network

                        Europe faces complex and unremitting challenges. Climate change, cyber security and an ageing population require an innovative and radical approach with broad social support. With a focus on mission-driven policies, governments make the right choice to confront today’s challenges. This is the conclusion of in the 2018 edition of State of Dutch Innovation: Missions and ‘new’ mission-driven policy.

According to the authors of the publication, mission-driven policy is shaped by ambition and courage, and requires co-creation with stakeholders and citizens. Research and innovation also contribute to a better understanding of the challenges. This should also lead to new insights and solutions. But many of the challenges require more than just scientific and technological solutions. They encourage the modernisation of legislation and regulations, information, new standards and incentives that promote different behaviour.
Cross-border character
Many of the current challenges are cross-border by nature. According to TNO, successful mission-driven policy therefore requires further international cooperation and coordination. The European, national and often regional dimensions of the challenges must be taken into account. Scalable solutions are also a crucial factor. In the new publication offers nine rules of thumb to further shape this approach.
Focco Vijselaar (r.), Ministery of Economic Affairs, was handed the first copy
First copy
Focco Vijselaar, director-general on Companies & Innovation of the Ministry of Economic Affairs & Climate Policy, received the first copy from Paul de Krom, of De Krom emphasised that “Shaping missions and formulating effective mission-driven policy is not an easy task, but successful classic missions such as the Delta Works show that joint action by government, companies, knowledge institutions, challengers and citizens makes a lot possible.” Vijselaar underlined the relevance of the publication: “This report provides tools to synthesise mission policy in order to tackle societal challenges. In the EU, nationally and regionally.
European focus
The 2018 publication of State of Dutch Innovation also fits in TNO's recent work in preparation for the development of Horizon Europe. As partner of a European consortium, has done extensive research, which resulted in two studies, on the concept of mission-oriented research and innovation policy, its potential impact and critical success factors. The research contributed to the European Commission thinking regarding its initial proposals for Horizon Europe.

About and its social role
Animal testing policy
Collaboration
Collaboration
Many different parties are involved in regulations that govern the testing of medicines, chemicals and food ingredients for their safety and efficacy. Complex ethical and economic considerations play a role in these regulations at a national and international level. 
To change people's views on animal testing and alternatives, it's essential to consider a broader perspective. One organisation can be a catalyst for change, but the whole field needs to change its collective mind-set. That is why participates in various groups to stimulate dialogue and find ways to make the 3principles work. The following are a few examples of our network.
International platforms
The 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
 (OECD) sets international standards for areas such as safety testing. On the topic of 3Rs, the has formally recognised alternative testing methods, e.g. 
the inoculated chicken eye test
 (ICE). scientists participate in the working groups of authorities, such as the European Food Safety Authority and the European Academies Science Advisory Council. The working groups gather to discuss policies and approaches on a more detailed level.
Projects
For the 'SLIM' project (Faster from Innovation to Man), is working with several Life Sciences companies, academic researchers, the City of Utrecht, the Province of Utrecht and the regulatory governmental authorities to speed up the process of getting innovative food and medicines from the laboratory to the clinic. The pre-competitive cooperation aims to develop good practices to offer regulatory authorities and other parties involved convincing arguments and data to accelerate the acceptance of alternative testing methods.
Education
For TNO, young scientists are the key to the future of science and 3research. To support these scientists' education funds two university positions: a professorship for Alternatives to Animal Testing at the University of Applied Sciences Utrecht and a university chair in Translational Toxicology at Wageningen University and Research Centre.
Animal protection organisations
Dialogue is important when it comes to advancing the 3Rs. For this reason, takes part in various national platforms and discussion groups with other interested parties, including animal protection groups and political parties. The goal of these discussion groups is to hear and share each others opinions on animal testing, to create respect for each others views and to explore common goals.

Animal testing policy
Better Alternatives
Leading to Better Alternatives
set up a research programme to refine, reduce and replace animal testing. In this programme, collaborates with others to accelerate the process of developing better alternatives.
It is worthwhile to develop, validate and implement 3methods not only from an ethical point of view, but also for scientific reasons. These alternatives lead to better predictions of the human situation and help to reduce the number of animals involved in testing and the discomfort these animals experience.
Refine
We aim to develop and adapt test methods in such a way that the test animals are exposed to as little discomfort and stress as possible. Imaging is an example of such a technique that we apply. An advantage of imaging is that it is usually minimally invasive. This reduces stress and discomfort in test animals, which also benefits actual test results. Stress itself can cause measurable changes in the body. These effects have to be filtered out of (or taken into account in) measurements in accordance with the actual goal of the test.
Reduce
aims to reduce the number of animals involved in testing. We regularly review our testing methods and implement integrated testing strategies. This helps us to determine whether animal testing is needed or whether the same information can be obtained in other ways. Data simulations are performed to determine the optimal study design that will provide the most valuable information with the smallest number of animals in each experiment.
Less discomfort in inhalation testing
Microdosing: tracing the tracer
Imaging
Replace
We continuously seek to replace animal studies with other methods, preferably using human tissue or cells. We work with human models, where possible, since that helps us to make better predictions about how a substance, for example a drug, will affect humans. When we have discovered ways to replace animal testing, we use them ourselves and encourage others to apply these alternative tests.
Gastrointestinal research
Eye irritation
Use of non-testing techniques
Non-testing techniques, such as computer modelling, are continually being developed and improved. In the case of chemicals, this could lead to the categorisation of substances with certain characteristics. This would mean a major shift away from generating safety data, to identifying, organising and interpreting safety information. In this new approach, non-testing techniques could replace or refine animal testing.
In general we aim to develop or improve methods that fulfil the industry's need to improve the development of new products by using more predictive models which preferably can also be applied in regulatory testing. When we find ways to improve our 3research methods, we make it a special priority to gain broader acceptance and implementation of these improvements.

Food & nutrition
Food & nutrition
This food sector in low-income groups represent a market value of $ 2895 billion (The Next 4 Billion, IFC/WR). In most developing countries the percentage of the total workforce employed in agriculture is more than 70%. Small scale farmers grow their own food and have some income of the surplus. Post-harvest losses at farmer level are a big issue.
Agricultural processing is sometimes used to increase shelf life, or for transformations into higher value added products. Urbanization increases the need for processed food. There is a need to improve the handling, grading and processing of crops at farmer (cooperative) level. Opportunities for product innovation can be found in off-grid cooling and storage, multipurpose processing equipment, autarkic energy or waste-to-energy conversion. The dominant view is that the issue is not the (un)availability of appropriate technology, but the (dis)organization of the value chain from farm to fork. Many NGO’s are working on organizing value chains, business oriented towards markets and customers. Mobile phone technology increases transparency in the agricultural value chain, for producers and consumers alike.
The main impacts of agricultural processing are food security, food safety and health, economic and environmental. Globally, nearly one billion people go hungry and 2 billion people are micronutrient malnourished (FAO). Diets of people living in poverty are more carbohydrate-based (e.g. maize, rice, sweet potatoes) because of price considerations. There is a lack of affordable proteins, vitamins and minerals. The food demand will grow in the future with 70% by 2050.

Access to water
Access to water
Water is crucial for improving farming, health and life quality. More than 1 billion people do not have access to safe drinking water and almost 3 billion people lack adequate sanitation.
This water sector in low-income groups represent a market value of $ 20 billion (The Next 4 Billion, IFC/WR). Demand for safe and affordable drinking water in developing countries is expected to increase significantly, especially in urban environments. Household level solutions use filters and disinfectants to treat bacteriological pollution, while community level solutions apply more complex technologies to purify water polluted with chemicals, heavy metals or brakish water. These solutions require more skill to operate, and often need access to electricity. Decentralized water purification solutions are developing-country specific technologies, as virtually all Western drinking water is centrally purified. Typically, NGO’s provide water or purification devices to the needy for free. This is often argued to disrupt the market for financially sustainable solutions. Especially in kiosks, new business models are emerging.
The focus of is on creating access to clean drinking water by developing applied purification technologies on household level and community level. Solutions are affordable, functional and accessible for the poor.

Real world fuel consumption of passenger cars
Real-world fuel consumption of passenger cars
In recent years, the fuel consumption of passenger cars has gone down. The decrease in fuel consumption when driving the car on the road is, however, less marked than the decrease in fuel consumption as measured during type approval testing. In fact, the difference between real-world consumption and that stated in brochures has widened in recent years. This is shown in studies in which has been monitoring the real-world fuel consumption of passenger cars. The reports from these studies can be found on this page.
According to the type approval test values, the average fuel consumption of new passenger cars in the Netherlands has fallen by 30% since 2000. However, consumption in practice is higher than what car manufacturers claim in their brochures. On average, new cars use around 30 to 50% more fuel than they do during tests. This means consumers purchasing a fuel-efficient vehicle save less than expected on fuel costs.
There is a direct link between fuel consumption and CO2 emissions; cars that use more fuel emit more CO2. The difference between real-world and type approval levels of fuel consumption means that new cars emit 50 grams more CO2 on average that they do during tests, for every kilometre they cover. This undermines the effectiveness of European and Dutch policies regarding the reduction of CO2 emissions in traffic.
is monitoring actual levels of consumption
Since 2008, has been investigating, on behalf of Travelcard Nederland and the Ministry of Infrastructure and the Environment, the real-world fuel consumption of passenger cars. An analysis of fuel pass data of a large and varied group of road-users, made available by Travelcard Nederland BV, has revealed trends in the average amount of fuel consumption.
Causes of the growing difference between nominal and real-world levels
Real-world levels of fuel consumption by a car depend very much on how it is used, such as the loads it carries and the types of journey it makes, as well as the driving style of the driver. Weather and traffic conditions also play an important part. Driving patterns during the tests on a roller dynamometer in a lab are not exactly the same as the average driving pattern in practice, and the environmental conditions vary too. In addition, tests of cars on a roller dynamometer do not include energy consumed by auxiliaries, such as lighting or air-conditioning. This means that, in practice, fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are greater than those measured in the tests.
The widening gap between the results from the laboratory tests and real life is caused primarily by the use of various consumption-reducing techniques (such as stop-start systems) that produce greater benefits during the tests than in reality, and by the more prevalent use by manufacturers of so-called flexibilities in the test procedure. By applying margins and ambiguities in the prescribed procedure and test conditions, it is possible to reduce the levels of consumption measured in tests without making technical modifications to the vehicle.
Real-world consumption of plug-in hybrid vehicles
Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles can run on fuel and electricity, which is obtained from the electricity network. When running on fuel, the causes mentioned above lead to a comparable difference between type-approval and real-world fuel consumption in the case of plug-in hybrid vehicles. However, there is an additional factor here - the number of kilometres covered by the vehicles when running on electricity. In practice, this proportion is, on average, significantly lower than during the tests, because many users do not regularly charge up their batteries. This results in a greater difference in fuel consumption and CO2 emissions between the tests and reality than is the case with conventional vehicles. In 2013, under the direction of the Formula Team, the ‘Plan van Aanpak verbeteren gebruik Plug-In hybride auto’s’ (‘plan of action for improving the fuel consumption of plug-in hybrid cars’) was devised. To support this, is monitoring real-world fuel  consumption levels and the proportion of kilometres covered using electric power on the basis of data supplied by Travelcard Nederland and MTC.
Objective information for substantiating and monitoring policy
In Brussels, the Dutch government is lobbying for effective legislation at European level to make road vehicles cleaner and more fuel efficient. In order to get these cleaner and more fuel efficient vehicles on the road more quickly, the Netherlands is taking additional measures, such as tax incentives. The research being carried out by is producing some important insights for the shaping and direction of European and Dutch policy. This includes efforts at bringing the tests more in line with actual practice, by making modifications to the testing procedure.
is measuring and monitoring the emissions by road vehicles in various measuring programmes. Emission factors are derived from these emission measurements. Information about vehicle emissions, about the measurements of these carried out by TNO, and about emission factors, can be found using the links below.

Animal testing policy
Facts and Figures 2017
Facts and Figures 2017
attaches great value to responsible animal testing and so animal testing is undertaken with the greatest possible care. Over the past 35 years the need for animal testing has more than halved in the Netherlands. Also within the number of animals used for testing was reduced in 2017 compared to 2016.
wants to reduce animal testing even further and therefore applies an active policy on developing and implementing the three Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement of animal testing) and the development of animal-free innovation. In 2010 committed to the Transparency Code on Animal Testing whereby and its subsidiaries enter into dialogue with the different stakeholders on every aspect of animal testing. Transparency on animal testing is one of the key elements of the 
policy
. undertakes a common 
policy on animal testing
 and work closely with other parties on the 3Rs.
provides information about the animal tests they carried out during 2017 under their own responsibility, indicating which animal tests were carried out for which purpose and the reasons underlying the cost-benefit analysis between the usefulness for society and animal welfare.
The annual report for 2017 on animal testing by covers the following topics:

Animal-Free Innovations
Animal-Free Innovations
The Netherlands aspires to be a leader in the international transition to research and innovation that makes use of no laboratory animals. is working on this transition with companies, governments, academic institutions and civil society organizations by developing and implementing new technologies to make it possible.
Laboratory animals are still needed in 
research
 into drug efficacy and safety, for example, partly due to regulations and partly because no reliable alternatives are yet available. New technologies are making it possible to accelerate the transition to animal-free drug testing. is developing practical innovations for both pre-clinical and clinical research.
Transition
There is plenty of dynamism both at home and abroad in the areas of science, health and people’s perception of safety and risks. This offers scope for new approaches to biomedical research and novel methods that better predict human responses to medical innovations. is working with its partners on the Animal-free Innovation Transition Programme (TPI), initiated by the Dutch national government, with the aim of accelerating the transition to research that no longer makes use of laboratory animals. ‘Renewal networks’ are the backbone of TPI: provisional networks with front-runners and interested parties in the chain who want to stick their necks out and collaborate intensively on animal-free innovations. is one of these front-runners.
“Our role at is to look beyond the hype by getting to the essence of new scientific research and by maintaining contacts in the business community so that we can match the supply of innovative research to demand coming from industry,” explains Han van de Sandt, head of Metabolic Health Research at TNO.
Technologies that make a difference
is also contributing to accelerating the transition to animal-free research by working on a number of technologies that will make a real difference, including organ-on-a-chip, microtracing, 
in silico systems
 and research with ex-vivo human 
tissue
. Human stem cells can be grown on 
organs-on-a-chip
 that can then be used to mimic a specific human organ function. These organs-on-a-chip will improve our ability to predict which drugs will work in whom, and which will be ineffective. 
Microtracing
 (also called microdosing) is a highly specialized technique that involves administering minute quantities of safe medications to human test subjects to study their effects.
TNO’s animal testing policy
As part of our efforts, has formulated a diligent 
animal testing policy
, which focuses on the 3principle (Replacement, Reduction, Refinement) and on animal-free innovations.
Collaboration in programmes
is involved in extensive national and international networks of organizations and individuals who, like us, stand for excellent biomedical research and animal-free innovations.

Sustainable energy
Energy is the second largest market at low-income groups, after food. Poor families spend >500 billion per year on energy solutions that are often polluting, inefficient and inappropriate. Nearly 3 billion people use open fires or rudimentary stoves for cooking or heating, mostly using wood or charcoal as a fuel .
1.2 billion people have no access to the electricity grid . These families use inefficient off-grid lighting points, such as kerosene lamps, candles or flashlights with disposable batteries.
 Indoor air pollution, caused by poor energy solutions, is recently recognized as one of the largest global killers . Especially women and children suffer from lung cancer, respiratory tract infections and low birth-weight, but also from severe injuries due to house fires and poisoning . The growing need for energy also leads to massive environmental damage, both on a local and a global scale (e.g. deforestation and climate change). New innovative solutions are required to address these challenges. is focussing on sustainable energy solutions for decentralized electrification.

Somni and conclude licence agreement for use of patents

                        Somni Corporation and research institute today signed an agreement that allows Somni to use patents for new, innovative fibre-optic sensors. Somni is a manufacturer of optical sensors that need to deliver outstanding performance in exceptional conditions. The field of application of these sensors includes aerospace and wind energy. The use of fibre optics makes Somni’s sensors insensitive to all kinds of electromagnetic disturbances, and they can be read over distances of several kilometres. The new licence agreement with enables Somni to further strengthen its fibre-optic sensor activities worldwide.
                    
For more information about this cooperation get in touch with Rogier Verberk

Wider monitoring solutions
Somni specialises in providing sensor solutions using telecommunication fibre optics and light to reliably collect information from the surroundings. Some of the specific applications where these sensors are used include the monitoring of offshore structures above or below sea level and the measuring of vibrations in a high vacuum with a fluctuating magnetic field and temperatures of several hundred degrees. These conditions demand the maximum and sensors based on conventional (electrical) techniques tend not to be up to the task.
Jac. Gofers, of Somni Corporation B.V.: “This is an important agreement for Somni, enabling us to further expand our existing product portfolio with innovations from This allows us to offer our customers an even wider spectrum of monitoring solutions, where the condition of assets can be determined even better on a daily basis. Better identification of safety and maintenance aspects means that safety risks are covered and unnecessary maintenance avoided.”
Since 1985 has been involved in the development of fibre-optic sensors. The first applications were aimed at underwater noise for the Dutch ministry of Defence. few years later, partly due to technical developments abroad, this technology became the topic of greater attention and an increasing number of possible applications emerged. is currently applying fibre-optic sensor technology to monitor bridges and roads, and there are developments in the field of very small fibre-optic sensors for diagnostics in the human body.
“This licence agreement underlines TNO's position as a supportive research institute, especially for Dutch companies, by creating innovations that boost their global competitiveness. TNO, in turn, needs high-tech companies like Somni that recognise the commercial potential of a certain technology and have the entrepreneurship to successfully market the patent portfolio,.” says Arnold Stokking, managing director of Industry.

Mobile services and ICT
Until recently, the poor had very limited access to information. Within the last decade, this has changed dramatically, due to two major changes.
Today, even in the most remote areas of Africa, even the poorest people use a mobile phone. The number of mobile phone connections in Africa is growing at an astonishing 18% per year, with total penetration now at over 500 million subscriptions . Over 6% of the total in Africa is originating from the mobile phone industry. Mobile phones are not just used for communication, but many services delivered over the mobile network are empowering people, or are directly linked to socio-economic development. Examples are educational games, disease monitoring services, market price information services or mobile financial services, all aimed at underserved populations and low-income groups.
second trend is the availability of data. Until recently, the amount of data coming from the African continent was very limited. Today, this is changing, as African economies and consumers are digitizing, they too are starting to create large quantities of big data, that can be used for many purposes, including development goals. Simultaneously, multilateral organisations and NGO’s are opening up their previously closed treasure chambers of project data and country statistics.
The combination of increased data availability, and a mobile network to deliver services, leads to great opportunities. Attention has to be paid to the long term value propositions of these innovations, to come to financially sustainable services. has long-lasting knowledge and experience in the application of innovative mobile services with socio-economic impact and a sound business model.

Animal testing policy
Animals in Life Sciences Research
Animals in Life Sciences Research
We want the food, medicines, personal care products and the household chemicals we use at home and in our workplaces to be safe and to keep us healthy. Life science research at helps to develop these products and predict whether substances are safe and work as they should.
In some cases animal testing is a necessary part of this research. Sometimes alternative methods are better at predicting how a substance will affect humans. As part of our healthy living program, is looking for the best methods to support innovative product development while seeking better alternatives.
Intrinsic value of animals
Recognising the intrinsic value of individual animals is a priority in TNO’s policy regarding animal experimentation. Animal testing is only acceptable if no suitable alternative is available and the goal of the study outweighs the discomfort the animals may experience. The decision to perform animal testing is made on a case-by-case basis. For each research proposal, the need to conduct animal testing and efforts to ensure animal welfare are evaluated according to strict legislation by an independent Animal Ethics Committee.
Refine, Reduce and Replace animal testing
Animal experiments have generated progress in science and human health and welfare. Nevertheless, we realise that the current tests on animals are not in all cases reliable enough to predict effects on humans. By implementing innovative “3methods” to Replace, Reduce and Refine animal testing, we propagate our ethical view on the intrinsic value of animals and, at the same time, contribute to better predictions for use in humans. has been applying the 3principles for years. To create greater synergy in this area, we have bundled our 3expertise in one of our new focus areas. We are dedicating more resources to make significant strides in the 3Rs while conducting excellent research. This ethical view is anchored in our policy, research programs and communication. This website allows us to provide more information about our 3goals and the ways we are working to develop alternatives and make them available for broader use.

Searching for alternatives
Animal research helps ensure that the food, medicines and chemicals we come in contact with are safe and keep us healthy. The newest insights and technologies make it possible to develop and apply alternatives to animal testing. At TNO, we seek better research alternatives that respect the value of animals and help improve the lives of humans.

), 
Viktoria
 of Sweden and 
IDIADA
 of Spain – are working together to accelerate the development of cooperative and autonomous driving and the standardization of communication systems and channels. On 14 April the transport ministers of the 28 member states reached agreement on the ‘
Declaration of Amsterdam
’, dealing with the required steps and rules for the development of self-driving technology in Europe. 2016 is part of an integrated plan to strengthen the position of the 
Brainport region
 and the Netherlands in the field of cooperative automated driving. Brainport is one of Europe’s most prominent and innovative high-tech centers.

uses Urban Strategy to map the effects of urban planning in Amsterdam

                        On the eve of the Smart City Expo World Congress in Barcelona, and Amsterdam presented the first results of the application of urban planning tool Urban Strategy, explaining to an international audience of innovators how this interactive tool helps them make informed decisions about the complex challenges cities face.
                    
Do you want to know more about using Urban Strategy for complex challenges?

Emission-free in 2025
The municipality of Amsterdam aims to be emission-free in 2025. The city is facing challenges around making the air clean, expanding the city and roads with associated road works. The expansion of environmental zones, the application of smart logistics and further stimulation of cycling are possible measures that can be applied specific to any area. In addition, the strong growth of the city is exerting further pressure on the use of space and the accessibility of the city. The municipality wants to become the green frontrunner of the Netherlands and Europe, and is using innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship to take this joint step.
Decision support for urban challenges
The city of Amsterdam uses Urban Strategy to find solutions to the complex challenge of tackling CO2 emissions, air quality, noise and traffic nuisance caused by road works, and to keep the growing city liveable.
Urban Strategy, an interactive instrument for spatial planning, shows the current situation in the city on a map. It quickly and interactively shows what happens when you introduce a scenario. For example, it can be seen in advance what impact the growth of a city district can have on accessibility and what noise pollution it can cause. And what effects can be expected from various variants of environmental zones on air quality and CO2 emissions. When planning large-scale road works, such as the Zuidas (South Axis), Urban Strategy also helps to determine the extent to which the measures chosen (such as shuttle buses and a Park and Ride) contribute to accessibility. This allows well-considered choices to be made.
Identifying the effects of measures
If a measure is actually implemented, Urban Strategy also identifies its effects by monitoring data. The scenarios are calculated and compared on the basis of the various KPIs (e.g. air quality, noise, traffic nuisance). This teaches which measure has which effect. Modelled and actual effects can be compared.
Amsterdam and have made the first Urban Strategy application to examine urban issues. Watch the film clip below.
