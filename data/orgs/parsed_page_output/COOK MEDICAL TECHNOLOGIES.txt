There are common themes across every specialty we support: patients want to get better and doctors want simpler, more effective options. That’s why we work hard to improve our minimally invasive devices and the way they’re delivered to hospitals and doctors around the world. Being a family-owned business allows us to do what’s best for the patient. It gives us the freedom to work through a problem for as long as it takes to find the simplest solution. We also have companies that work in areas outside of device manufacturing. To learn about them, visit:

1960s : How got its start
"For me to make my product, all needed was a blowtorch, a soldering iron, and a few little tools and fixtures could make myself."

Bill speaks about the company's early days at our 40th anniversary celebration.
Bill met Dr. Charles Dotter at a Radiological Society meeting in Chicago. This chance meeting started a relationship based on a shared vision—one that kicked off the field of minimally invasive medicine. was the first company to package the three primary components for percutaneous catheterization— needles, wire guides, and catheters — in one convenient set.  No one tells the story of our company’s humble beginnings than our founder, Bill Cook.
1970s : time of intense expansion
"We purchased an extra whistling kettle, and just like that, we were able to double production."

The growth of the company surprised many people, including us.
When the company started in the 60’s, Bill thought his business might eventually be able to support his family and maybe two or three other people. He was quickly forced to revise that estimate. The 1970’s was the decade when expanded to Europe and Asia. (Not bad for a company that started in the spare bedroom of an apartment.) By the end of the ’70s, the volume of products that shipped allowed doctors to perform 2,000 cardiovascular catheterizations per day.
1980s: Getting products to physicians faster
"We're expanding so fast, it's hard to keep track."

We have a very specific way of developing our products and devices.
In the 1980’s doctors needed new and better equipment to help their patients, especially patients in underserved specialties like gastrointestinal endoscopy, urology and women’s health. These doctors often approached because of our reputation for customizing products. Cook’s research and development facility, Institute, was founded in the ’80s in response to this demand for new products. Med Institute helped us more quickly take products from concept to production.
1990s: time of tremendous growth
"We must change our approach to doing business and assume our global role as a single organization—not as an assortment of individual companies."
Bill Cook, Founder, We introduced the world’s first intravascular coronary stent in the ’90s. The rest of the decade we did business on a steadily increasing scale. We added more companies, specialties and employees and we got better at obtaining and defending patents. It was also during this time that Canada, Inc, formed a small manufacturing company to supply lead aprons and Australia began a division to develop, manufacture, and distribute programmable pumps and infusion devices outside the United States. These and other efforts showed that further expansion of the global market for products was underway.
2000s: Improving healthcare delivery
"There are still a lot of good things going on. There are still a lot of areas that we have yet to scratch the surface on."
Scott Eells — Vice President, Operations
lot has changed in the 50 years has been in business, but we have always worked with physicians to develop new ways to improve minimally invasive medicine. The future won’t change that focus, but it will require more than just innovative devices. It will require us to develop new treatments for chronic disease, like drug- or cell-based therapies, for chronic disease. It will also require working with the entire healthcare supply chain to find better and faster ways to get products to patients.
2010s: The Future of Minimally Invasive Medicine
"We have the rare privilege of being able to really help people. When you can make a favorable impact on someone's health, someone's real health, that's a pretty special thing."
Bruce Gingles, Vice President, Global Technology Assessment and Healthcare Policy

Former President Kem Hawkins explains one of the concepts that drives everything we do: Tomorrow can always be better than today.
In the early 2000s, the healthcare industry came under increasing pressure to treat a growing number of patients with less funding. This pressure led to look beyond the devices we made and to look at the ways we deliver those devices to customers. We created our Healthcare Business Solutions division to work with our customers to improve the supply chain.
About our Founder
Many things have been said about Bill Cook. Steve Ferguson, Chairman of Group, wrote some thoughts about his friend in an e-mail shortly after Bill died.

The Way We Do Business
Our Ethics & Compliance program grew from founder Bill Cook’s strong opinion that you should treat others the way you’d like to be treated. In fact, everything has done since day one has been based on one simple thought: Do the right thing.
When the company got too big for Bill to explain his philosophy in person to everyone, he wrote it down. These days, we have an active Ethics & Compliance team and program that will carry the company culture on to future generations of employees.

How We Approach Our Most Valuable Relationships
Patients
The doctor-patient relationship is sacred. This relationship should be supported but not interfered with. We have a responsibility to protect the patient’s right to quality care, access to information, and privacy.
Customers
We believe customers deserve a strong partner who treats them fairly and honestly. This also applies to clinicians as well as our distribution partners and supply chain customers.
Government
We work openly, honestly, and transparently with government agencies. We’re not afraid to speak up when we think something should be done differently in the interest of patients and progress.
Communities
Being a strong community partner is good for the local community, good for local business, and good for our own employees. We contribute more than money; we give time, leadership, thoughts, and ideas.
Each Other
We’re driven by personalities and passion, not egos. We treat our employees like adults and ask that everyone at accept responsibility for their own successes and failures.
