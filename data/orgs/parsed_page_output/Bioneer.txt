Bioneer, an innovative biotech company since 1992


is Korea’s leading biotech company. was the first Korean biotechnology company when it was established in 1992. The company has developed state of art molecular biology products and technologies including oligonucleotides, thermostable polymerases, and instruments of gene manipulation (automatic nucleic acid extractor, thermal cycler, real-time qinstruments and sequencer). From its inception, has invested in the integration of recombinant technology, fermentation, biochemistry and nucleic acid chemistry in addition to mechanics, photonics and electronics. The company is positioned to fully-integrate its capability to develop next generation technologies in the post-genome era through the invention of new biochemistry and instruments. now runs two production and research facilities in Korea which are a total of 226,000 square feet. Equipped with proprietary 384 synthesizers, these facilities contain a full production line for oligonucleotide synthesis and siproducts. In addition to DNA/manufacturing, makes novel molecular biology products and recombinant proteins including systems and reagents. 
After a successful Initial Public Offering a few years ago, launched Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary. The American subsidiary is located in Alameda, CA, in the heart of the San Francisco Bay Area. The company is devoted to providing state of art solutions to the global life science community in academia, biotech, clinical labs and pharmaceutical companies. We have expertise in a wide range of areas.
