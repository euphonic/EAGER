Orthopaedic Reconstruction
is a world leader in joint replacement systems for knees, hips and shoulders.
Whether through extending the life and functionality of implants, improving operating room efficiency, or promoting faster healing and other clinical outcomes, our innovations differentiate us and provide solutions to active patients seeking to regain their quality of life while enhancing economic value for all of our customers.
Knee implants
offers an innovative range of products for specialised knee replacement procedures. It is a routine operation for knee pain most commonly caused by arthritis. Every year more than two million patients receive total, partial or revision knee replacements.
Our knee systems include the LEGION◊/GENESIS◊ Total Knee System   a comprehensive system designed to allow surgeons to address a wide range of knee procedures from primary to revision and our  JOURNEY◊ Active Knee Solutions . has been engineered to empower patients with a renewed active lifestyle by breaking through traditional knee replacement barriers and delivering function, motion and durability through MATCHING◊.
These systems also feature VERILAST◊ Technology, our advanced bearing surface . The Primary Knee with Technology has been laboratory-tested to 30 years of simulated wear.
Our knee systems also use our VISIONAIRE◊Patient-Matched Instrumentation . With Instrumentation, a patient's and X-rays are used to create customised cutting guides that allow the surgeon to achieve optimal mechanical axis alignment of the new implant. cutting guides also help to save time by reducing the number of procedural steps and instruments used in the operating room.
During 2015, we acquired the Zimmer® Unicompartmental High Flex Knee ('ZUK') system in the market. is a clinically proven uni knee replacement introduced globally in 2004, and expands our access to the attractive area of partial knee joint reconstruction.
Hip implants
Our hip implant franchise offers a range of specialist products for reconstruction of the hip joint. This may be necessary due to conditions such as arthritis, causing persistent pain, and/ or as a result of hip fracture. Every year more than two million patients undergo total, resurfacing and revision hip replacement procedures.
For hip implants, has developed a range of primary hip systems. Core systems include the ANTHOLOGY◊ Hip System , SYNERGY◊ Hip System, the SMF◊ Femoral Hip System , POLARSTEM◊ Femoral Hip System , the R3◊ Acetabular System and the POLARCUP◊ Dual Mobility Hip System.
This diversity exemplifies our commitment to providing surgeons with implant and instrumentation options that meet the specific demands of their preferred surgical approach, most notably the direct anterior or posterolateral approach.
Nephew's portfolio includes the REDAPT◊ Revision Femoral System . The need to perform a revision can occur for a variety of reasons including infection, dislocation, or failure of the implants to achieve biologic fixation. turns such complex hip revisions into efficient, reproducible surgeries, allowing surgeons to effectively recreate a patient's unique functionality, while quickly and easily addressing issues such as poor bone quality.
Bearing surfaces
The Orthopaedics business uses a range of bearing surfaces in its implant systems, including its proprietary OXINIUM◊ Technology. Oxidized Zirconium, branded , combines the enhanced wear resistance of a ceramic bearing with the superior durability of a metallic bearing to provide a surface that is 4,900 times more wear resistant than cobalt chrome. When Technology is combined with highly cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) to create Technology, the results are even greater. In fact, the Primary Knee with Technology, is the only knee system with a 30-year wear performance claim approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - more than double the performance expectation for wear compared to conventional technologies.
