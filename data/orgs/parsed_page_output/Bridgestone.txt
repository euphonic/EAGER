Global Dream 
Founder Shojiro Ishibashi
At Bridgestone, our dream is to become a truly global enterprise and to establish the brand as the undisputed world No. 1 brand in both name and substance. Across the globe, our entire team is focused on achieving this goal.
The roots of our dream date back to the establishment of Tire Co., Ltd. in 1931. Anticipating the future potential of tires for passenger cars and the international development of the business, founder Shojiro Ishibashi used an English translation of his surname for the name of the company. Even then he may indeed have been dreaming of the future of the Group.
As Japan's automobile industry grew, The Group expanded its business to become Japan's largest tire manufacturer. The company also actively expanded overseas, particularly in Asia. In 1988, the company acquired The Firestone Tire & Rubber Company, a well respected global with a venerable history of its own. This transformed into one of the world's largest tire and rubber companies and created a global team dedicated to serving customers worldwide with the highest level of quality, service and technology.
We hope this introduction to our company will provide you with a deeper understanding of the Group's strengths, as well as our future direction.

                                    Lifelong friends, Harvey Firestone (right), founder of The Firestone Tire & Rubber Company, Thomas Edison (center) and Henry Ford (left)
                                  

                                    The “Firestone Boys” proudly show off the new gum-dipped balloon tires that first appeared at the 1925 Indianapolis 500. Firestone brand remains the exclusive tire of the Indianapolis 500 and the IndyCar Series.

Copyright© Copyright© CloseThe Essence (Corporate Philosophy)
The Group's mission is based on the words of its founder: “Serving Society with Superior Quality.” To fulfill this mission, Group has used the concept of “foundation” to demonstrate the sustained commitment of employees to provide its customers with world class products and services and to serve the communities where does business. “The Essence” is composed of the above words, integrated corporate culture, and diversity that today's company has inherited and a shared sense of values that can be embraced by employees around the world.
Mission
“Serving Society with Superior Quality”
We aspire to offer the best for our customers and to society, not only in terms of our products, services and technology, but in all of our corporate activities.
Our commitment to quality stems not from want of profit, but out of a passion for improving the safety and lives of people everywhere.
Through our Mission, we strive to be a company trusted by the world - a company in which all of us can take great pride.
Foundation
“Seijitsu-Kyocho” [Integrity and Teamwork]
Seijitsu-Kyocho is about adhering to principles of good faith as you carry out your work, in the way you treat others, and as you participate in and engage with society. It is about producing positive outcomes by respecting a diversity of skills, values, experiences, genders, and races and fostering teamwork.
“Shinshu-Dokuso” [Creative Pioneering]
Shinshu-Dokuso is about envisioning the future and proactively challenging ourselves to identify and develop innovations that will further benefit society and respond to customer needs -- from the customer's point of view. It is about unleashing creativity and innovation to develop new business domains and creating demand for new and beneficial products through our own unique methods.
“Genbutsu-Genba” [Decision-Making Based on Verified, On-Site Observations]
Genbutsu-Genba is about taking the time to go on-site and personally verify the facts, then using those observations to make informed decisions. It is about not being satisfied with the current situation, and making informed decisions that will lead us ever closer to ideal products and solutions.
“Jukuryo-Danko” [Decisive Action after Thorough Planning]
Jukuryo-Danko is about investigating all options and the full range of possibilities, giving careful thought as to how to execute the decided course of action. It is about identifying what is necessary and deciding on a vision. And once a decision and course of action is determined, it is about moving forward with a sense of urgency.
The Essence Framework
In 2011, the Group refined the Essence (corporate philosophy), and the Environmental Mission Statement and the Safety Mission Statement were also refined consecutively. In 2015, we completed the Essence Framework with these two statements and formulation of the Quality Mission Statement. Going forward, we will further develop and advance the Group’s global activities based on the Essence Framework.
About About The Group is eternally committed to serving society with superior quality.
The group will fulfill our responsibilities decisively. As you reach for the future, the Group will remain by your side.Global
