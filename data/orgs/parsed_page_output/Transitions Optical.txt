WE'ADAPTING
We are pioneers in light management and home to many firsts.  Since we were founded in 1990, we have expanded from a cramped office with one portable computer in the Tampa Bay area to an eyecare industry leader that is now home to more than 1,500 committed employees globally.
We were the first to successfully commercialize a plastic photochromic lens in 1990.  Our research and development professionals are continuously innovating our everyday adaptive lenses, improving darkness, fade back speed, color, responsiveness and indoor clarity.  In the last few years we’ve continued to make significant advances in color science and lens materials, creating a better photochromic experience that’s available to more people.  We’ve also expanded our family of brands and now have a product for anyone who wants more than a basic lens.  And we’re adapting to new markets through partnerships with brands like Nike
®
, Oakley

 and Bell
