History
Our history
Today we operate in most of the world's countries and are best known by our familiar brand names: Exxon, Esso and Mobil. We make the products that drive modern transportation, power cities, lubricate industry and provide petrochemical building blocks that lead to thousands of consumer goods.
1859
Colonel Edwin Drake and Uncle Billy Smith drill the first successful oil well in Titusville, Pennsylvania. The colonel's discovery triggers an oil boom that parallels the gold rush of a decade earlier.
1870
Rockefeller and his associates form the Standard Oil (Ohio), with combined facilities constituting the largest refining capacity of any single firm in the world. The name Standard is chosen to signify high, uniform quality.
1879
Standard Oil Co. purchases a three-quarters interest in Vacuum Oil for $200,000. As a lubricants pioneer, Vacuum Oil introduces a number of popular products, including the revolutionary Gargoyle 600-Steam Cylinder Oil.
1882
Standard Oil lubricates Thomas Edison's first central generating system. Also in this year, Standard Oil Trust forms to include the Standard Oil of New Jersey (Jersey Standard) and the Standard Oil of New York (Socony).
1885
The Standard Oil Trust moves its headquarters to 26 Broadway, New York City. The nine-story office building becomes a landmark. The same year, Vacuum develops Gargoyle Arctic engine oils for newly designed generators and motors that operate at speeds of up to 1,000 rpm.
1903
The Wright brothers, Wilbur and Orvillle, use both Jersey Standard fuel and Mobiloil (Vacuum) lubricants for their historic first flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.
1906
Socony gains a strong foothold in the vast market for kerosene in China by developing small lamps that burned kerosene efficiently. The lamps become known as Mei-Foo, from the Chinese symbols for Socony, meaning "beautiful confidence".
1911
Following a landmark Supreme Court decision, Standard Oil breaks up into 34 unrelated companies, including Jersey Standard, Socony and Vacuum Oil.  The year also marks the first time Jersey Standard's sales of kerosene are surpassed by gasoline, a product that in the early days had often been discarded as a nuisance.
1915
Ralph De Palma, winner of the Indianapolis 500, is the first of many Indy winners to use Mobil products. His average speed: 89.84 mph.
1919
Jersey Standard acquires a 50 percent interest in Humble Oil & Refining of Texas. It was during this year that Humble, led by its pioneering Chief Geologist Wallace Pratt, employed micropaleontology, the study of microscopic fossils contained in cuttings and core samples from drilling, as an aid in finding oil.
1920
Jersey Standard researchers produce rubbing alcohol, or isopropyl alcohol — the first commercial petrochemical.
1926
Embodying the phonetic rendition of the initials ‘S’ and ‘O’ in Standard Oil, Jersey Standard brings out a new blend of fuel under the trade name Esso.
1927
Humble geophysicists use a refraction seismograph and discover an oil field in Sugarland, Texas.
1928
Amelia Earhart uses Mobiloil to protect Friendship when she makes her historic solo flight across the Atlantic. The previous year, Charles Lindbergh used Mobiloil in the Spirit of St. Louis on the first solo flight across the Atlantic.
1936
First commercial unit in a cat-cracking refinery begins operation at Socony-Vacuum’s Paulsboro, New Jersey, refinery. The unit used a process developed by French scientist Eugene Houdry with the financial backing of Socony-Vacuum. The process added a clay-like catalyst to the cracking process to boost gasoline yields and octane rating.
1937
Jersey Standard researchers produce an artificial rubber, butyl. Today, butyl is used in the creation of tires, surgical tapes, protective coatings and more.
1938
The world's first commercial production of alkylate begins at a Humble plant in Baytown, Texas. Alkylation made possible the manufacturing of iso-octane, used as a blending agent to produce 100-octane aviation gasoline.
1942
The world’s first fluid catalytic cracker goes onstream at Louisiana Standard’s Baton Rouge refinery. The process, developed by four Jersey Standard researchers known as the “four horsemen,” improved on the Houdry method for cat cracking and eventually became the industry standard for producing gasoline. Fortune magazine called it “the most revolutionary chemical-engineering achievement of the last 50 years.”
1952
Jersey Standard introduces Uniflo motor oil, the first multigrade motor oil recommended for both summer and winter use.
1955
Jersey Standard establishes the Esso Education Foundation, a program that gives financial aid to private colleges and universities.
1958
Pan American Airways flies its first trans-Atlantic Boeing 707 flight from New York to London. The flight is fueled by Mobil aviation fuel.
1959
An advertising copywriter in Chicago comes up with the advertising slogan “Put a tiger in your tank.”
1963
Humble invents 3-seismic technology, a revolution that completely changes the way the industry searches for oil and gas resources. (This breakthrough technology, coupled with the use of massive parallel computers in seismic imaging, has helped our geologists sharply reduce finding costs since the 1980s while increasing new field resource additions.)
1966
Mobil celebrates 100 years since the founding of the Vacuum Oil in 1866 and changes its name to Mobil Oil Corporation. The launches a wide-reaching identity program to emphasize the Mobil trade name.
1972
Jersey Standard officially changes its name to Exxon Corporation. The name change is approved by Jersey Standard shareholders in a special shareholders’ meeting.
1974
Mobil introduces a synthetic automotive engine lubricant — Mobil 1. Today, Mobil 1 is the world’s leading synthetic motor oil.
1975
Mobil participates in completion of Beryl A, the world's first concrete production platform. The 50-story-high structure was the prototype for other concrete deepwater facilities operating in the North Sea.
1976
Mobil invents a process for converting methanol into high-octane gasoline through the use of the company’s versatile ZSM-5 catalyst.
1980
Exxon opens its own facility for environmental health at East Millstone, New Jersey. Exxon Biomedical Sciences, Inc. conducts to further assure the safety of Exxon operations and products.
1982
Exxon celebrates 100 years since the formation of the Standard Oil Trust in 1882. In its first hundred years, the evolved from a domestic refiner and distributor of kerosene to a large multinational corporation, involved at every level of oil and gas exploration, production, refining and marketing, and petrochemicals manufacturing.
1986
Exxon and Engineering invents a powerful new imaging technique called 3-microtomography to study the internal structure of opaque objects without damaging them.

The took immediate responsibility for the spill, cleaned it up and voluntarily compensated those who claimed direct damages. Learn more about the Exxon Valdez.
1989
Exxon introduces Exxpol, a single-site metallocene catalyst used to produce consistent, controllable molecular structures that make plastic and rubber products tougher and impact-resistant, with less haze and with excellent organoleptics (low off-taste and odor).
1995
Exxon establishes the Save The Tiger Fund in partnership with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation. The Save The Tiger Fund is dedicated to supporting the conservation of Asia’s remaining wild tigers. Since its establishment, has provided $1 million annually in support of the Save The Tiger Fund.

Business solicitation and recruiting scams
Business solicitation and recruiting scams
Business Solicitation Scams
does not use social media and unsolicited email or written correspondence to request that individuals or businesses pay an advance fee of any kind in order to conduct business with ExxonMobil.
It has come to our attention that unauthorized individuals have attempted to use the name and logo, as well as the names of directors, executives and employees, in emails and on web sites to solicit up-front fees from interested individuals and businesses.  If you are contacted by an individual or business seeking up-front fees, be aware that offers or proposals communicated through social media, email or written correspondence and purporting to be on behalf of may be fraudulent.
Unauthorized individuals have also used third party websites to conduct business solicitation scams.  does not control any third party websites, and makes no warranty or representation regarding, and is not responsible for, any third party websites or the content of such websites.  Inclusion of links or sharing tools to third party sites is not an endorsement of the content of such sites.  Should you suspect that you have received a business solicitation scam, you are advised to report the suspected behavior to the third party website.
Recruiting scams
does not use recruiting or placement agencies that charge candidates an advance fee of any kind (e.g., placement fees, immigration processing fees, etc.). Unfortunately, we've been made aware of unauthorized individuals using the name and logo in emails and on web sites in an attempt to solicit up-front fees from interested job-seekers.  The fraudulent job offers are typically sent via email and inform the targeted victim they either have been hired by the or may obtain employment with the company, and for a fee (the amount varies from $100 to as much as several thousand dollars).  Victims are often asked to provide personal information, send fees via wire transfer, personal check or money, and to make travel arrangements for a fictitious prospective interview.  Such offers and solicitations for candidates to pay fees and incur prospective employee costs are not made by and are fraudulent.
Periodically, engages recruiting and/or placement agencies to help us identify potential candidates for specific positions. If you are contacted by a legitimate recruiting or placement agency, there should be no cost to you, the job-seeker.
Do’s & Don’ts
Understand that unsolicited communications can be used to conduct “phishing” attacks that try to trick you into disclosing personal, financial or otherwise valuable information.
Fraudulent solicitations may include suspicious hints (e.g., non-email addresses, gross exaggerations, misspellings, poor grammar, and requests for money)
Do not respond to unsolicited business offers from people, email addresses or social media that you do not know or trust
Do not open attachments or click on links in suspicious emails from individuals or websites you do not know or trust
Do not disclose personal or financial information to individuals you do not know or trust or on a website that you do not trust.  Should you do so, consider reporting the incident to your local law enforcement.

How many people around the world rely on biomass energy like wood or dung for cooking?
3 million 
INCORRECT
150 million 
INCORRECT
1 billion 
INCORRECT
2.6 billion 
CORRECT
2.6 billion
The International Energy Agency and other global organizations estimate approximately 2.6 billion people in developing countries – more than one-third of the world’s population – rely on biomass for cooking. An additional 200-300 million people rely on coal for cooking and heating purposes.  All this has serious consequences for human health; about 3.5 million people die prematurely each year from exposure to indoor air pollution from these practices. Access to modern energy sources and advanced technologies could cut this loss of life significantly.

Which product is not made from petrochemicals derived from oil or natural gas?
Aspirin 
INCORRECT
Lipstick 
INCORRECT

Rubber 
CORRECT
Soft contact lenses 
INCORRECT
Rubber
This is somewhat of a trick question. Rubber is a naturally occurring product derived from trees and plants, mostly in South America and Southeast Asia. In the 19th century, the realization that rubber had many useful applications set off a global rubber boom. However, synthetic rubber made from oil and natural gas began to be developed early in the 20th century and now accounts for the lion’s share of global rubber use, particularly in tires for automotive vehicles.

By 2040, the world’s population is expected to rise to approximately 9 billion, up from about 7 billion today. Close to 95 percent of this population growth is likely to occur in countries that are not members of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, particularly in Africa and Asia Pacific. By 2040, nine of the world’s most populous cities – and one of every three people on the planet – will be in China or India.

With the global economy expected to grow 130 percent from 2010 to 2040, and population expected to increase to 9 billion, how much more energy will be required?
35 percent more 
CORRECT
50 percent more 
INCORRECT
100 percent more 
INCORRECT
130 percent more 
INCORRECT
About 35 percent more
Energy and prosperity are closely linked. Despite nearly 2 billion more people and substantial economic growth, global energy demand is expected to rise just 35 percent from 2010 to 2040. This is thanks to expected gains in energy efficiency around the world – advanced cars with better fuel economy entering the market are just one example. Without such efficiency improvements, global energy demand in 2040 could be about twice what it is today.

In nations all over the world, people are moving from the country into cities, particularly in developing regions. Only 25 percent of Chinese citizens lived in urban areas as recently as 1990. What percentage of the Chinese population will be living in cities in 2040?

INCORRECT
75 percent
By 2040, about three-quarters of Chinese will live in urban areas. Over the next several decades, urbanization in China and other nations will drive demand for energy not just for basic needs but also modern uses such as air conditioning, appliances and electronics. In rural China today, for example, there are only about 16 air conditioners for every 100 households; in China's urban areas, that ratio is 112 per 100.

More than 100 million Americans gathered around big-screen televisions to watch the Super Bowl. What happened to home electricity usage during the Big Game?
Home electricity usage went up 
INCORRECT
Home electricity usage went down 
CORRECT
Electricity use went down
In 2011, estimated the electricity used by TVs showing the Super Bowl was enough to power all the homes in Dallas, Green Bay and Pittsburgh for 10 hours. It’s a lot of electricity. However, subsequent analysis showed that home electricity usage actually decreased during the game, three times more than the amount of energy consumed by all the TVs watching it. That’s because many households don't use other appliances during the game, and because many people watch at other people’s homes.

What is the most cost-effective method for cooking in the kitchen?
Convection oven 
INCORRECT
Conventional oven 
INCORRECT
Microwave oven 
CORRECT
Stovetop burner 
INCORRECT
Microwave oven
The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy calls the microwave the most efficient method for cooking. Microwaves use a lot of energy when operating, but thanks to reduced cooking times, using a microwave oven will use two-thirds as much energy as a conventional oven. That’s because microwaves’ heat waves focus on what’s in the container, and don’t waste energy on heating the air or container around it.

Transportation is the main customer of aluminum, according to the Aluminum Association. It is light – cutting down on weight and fuel consumption – as well as strong, particularly when alloyed with other metals to increase strength. “Aluminum can reduce the weight of many key car components by up to 40 percent compared to only 11 percent for high-strength steel,” notes energy expert Vaclav Smil. “That is why the car industry now consumes about a third of the country’s aluminum.”   The fuel economy benefits from aluminum apply in the skies as well as on the roads. Aluminum and advanced composites now accounts for about 70 percent of the weight of an unloaded airplane.

Innovating to drive our success
Technology is the foundation of ExxonMobil’s business and a key enabler to grow shareholder value. Our ongoing commitment to innovation, along with our proprietary technologies, provides a unique competitive advantage that:
Reduces costs
Improves efficiencies
Maximizes our return on projects
Our focus on innovation is not new: For more than 135 years, we have pioneered the science that enables innovative technologies such as the lithium ion battery, high-octane gasoline, 3seismic imaging, and many others. These transformational discoveries changed our industry and the world, helping make modern society possible.
Every day, come to work and have the opportunity to new ideas that one day could make a real difference. Innovation is who we are and what we do.

Reducing costs
Enhancing output
Minimizing environmental impacts
Photo: Since 2008, scientists and engineers have received more than 3,300 patents in the United States alone.
For example, we have developed technologies that reduce corrosion by enabling the dehydration of natural gas inside pipes rather than in costly towers. These technologies are expected to reduce near-term offshore project costs by more than $750 million.
We also recently developed a high-manganese “super steel” for our Kearl mining operations that will likely save hundreds of millions of dollars over the life of the asset.
In partnership with the Georgia Institute of Technology, we are exploring the use of reverse osmosis through synthetic molecular membranes to reduce the amount of energy required in our manufacturing operations.
If brought to scale, this breakthrough could reduce:
Annual industry CO2 emissions by a level equivalent to the annual energy-related emissions of about 5 million homes
Global energy costs by up to $2 billion a year
$1 billion invested annually in our worldwide and development programs
175+ university partnerships over the past 10 years
19,000+ employs more than 19,000 scientists and engineers
Advancing energy sources and products
In the Upstream, our capabilities in subsurface definition and development are enabling us to find more oil and natural gas, and then recover more from the reservoirs we find. For example, we developed proprietary software with the National Center for Supercomputing Applications that quadruples the number of processors used to model complex oil and natural gas reservoirs, improving exploration and production results. Thanks to this innovation, we can simulate how hydrocarbons flow through the subsurface and plan where to drill new production wells in record time. Analysis that took weeks can now be completed in a single day.
Our proprietary seismic imaging technology helps us see opportunities in the subsurface that others cannot. We successfully applied this on discoveries in the Black Sea and offshore Guyana.
In the Downstream, technology is enabling us to expand our product offerings to meet today’s market demands. In Rotterdam, we are building a new, best-in-class hydrocracking unit that will use proprietary technology to create high-value, ultra-low-sulfur fuels and lube basestocks. This is just one example of our investments in new proprietary technologies – roughly $12 billion of projects that are expected to yield returns of more than 20 percent.
Our Chemical business also benefits from and development, particularly in the area of innovative product development. We developed and commercialized a polypropylene product that enables packaging manufacturers to produce rigid packages (such as plastic food containers) that result in:
Thinner walls, without sacrificing toughness
Reduced package weight
Less material usage
We are also working to identify advanced biofuels – a promising technology with the potential to increase energy supplies and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We announced a breakthrough in our with Synthetic Genomics, Inc., involving modification of an algae strain that doubled its oil content without significantly inhibiting the strain’s growth – a key milestone in potential scalability of the technology.
Every day, come to work and have the opportunity to new ideas that one day could make a real difference. Innovation is who we are and what we do.

Highlight
Since 40 percent of global energy-related carbon emissions come from power generation, we are researching scalable and affordable carbon capture technologies that can benefit power plants and other large industrial facilities.
Capturing carbon dioxide using today’s technology is complex, costly, and can reduce the power output by up to 20 percent. is working with FuelCell Energy, Inc. to reduce CO₂ emissions from natural gas power plants by as much as 90 percent using fuel cells, which create power instead of using it.

High-impact new opportunities
In the Upstream, is pursuing high-quality exploration and production projects, including:
Guyana: We hold more than 11 million acres offshore, where we have made six discoveries to date. Additional leads have been identified, and exploration and development activities will continue throughout 2018.
Brazil: We acquired interest in the more-than-2-billion-barrel Carcara field. We also captured 10 exploration blocks in bid round 14, including acreage with significant potential in the pre-salt play, one of the fastest-growing deepwater plays in the world. Exploration and development activities are planned to begin in 2018.
Permian Basin: In 2017, we added nearly 275,000 net acres to our position through a series of acquisitions and acreage trades, bringing our total Permian resource base to more than 9 billion oil-equivalent barrels. Our Permian position now delivers lower-cost production, which is available as feedstock to our Gulf Coast refineries and chemical plants.
Our growth opportunities are geographically diverse and will yield attractive returns, even in a low-price environment. To achieve this, we apply industry-leading capabilities, key technologies, and proprietary practices that improve drilling performance, reduce field development costs, and deliver operational efficiencies.
Photo: Our successful exploration campaign offshore Guyana continued through 2017, with six discoveries to date.
Capitalizing on expertise
Our global position is unmatched in the industry. We have interest in 17 trains around the world, with net interest capacity of 22 million tonnes annually.
We enhanced our leading position with two major deals in 2017:
InterOil Corporation acquisition. Provides access to multiple discovered fields and additional exploration acreage in Papua New Guinea. These high-quality assets, coupled with growing resource discoveries on existing acreage, provide a foundation for a low-cost, multi-train expansion of existing facilities.
Entry in deepwater Area 4 block offshore Mozambique. Contains an estimated 85 trillion gross cubic feet of natural gas in-place. This resource will support an ExxonMobil-led, multi-train development, with potential capacity ultimately exceeding 40 million tonnes per year.
Extracting additional value
In the Downstream, we are investing in technology and facilities to produce higher-value products to meet the growing demand for enhanced fuels and premium lubricants. Capturing a larger share of these growing markets enables us to realize higher overall margins from our existing sites.
In 2018, two new units will begin operating:
coker unit at our Antwerp refinery. This will upgrade high-sulfur fuel oil into various forms of cleaner-burning diesel and distillates.
hydrocracking unit in Rotterdam. Using our proprietary technology, it will produce high-value, ultra-low-sulfur fuels and Group lube basestocks.
We announced an expansion at our Singapore refinery to produce the company’s Group basestocks, which are used across a range of industries. Completion is anticipated in 2019.
We are also enhancing our ability to handle light crude from the Permian at our refineries in Baton Rouge and Baytown.
New investments delivering:
> 100,000 barrels per day capacity for high-value fuels and lube basestocks
> 200,000 barrels per day of additional production capacity
500,000 tonnes increase in chemical manufacturing
Investing to meet chemical demand
Global demand for chemicals continues to create opportunities for value growth. To meet that demand, we are investing more than $10 billion over the next five years in both new and expanded facilities on the Gulf Coast, leveraging logistically advantaged oil and natural gas to create the chemical building blocks for end products used around the world.
At our Singapore chemical complex, we are expanding capacity with our recent acquisition of Jurong Aromatics. We are starting up new facilities that will manufacture higher-performance products. These enhancements to our complex enable us to better serve the major growth market in the Asia Pacific region.
The company’s dedication to safety, people, and the environment is so far beyond what most people think. That focus really sets us apart from our competition.

Portfolio spans the value chain
Our operations demonstrate how integration drives value.
businesses produce oil and natural gas in the Permian and other basins.
Volumes are transported via our midstream assets to our refineries and chemical complexes along the Gulf Coast and in the Midwest.
There they are upgraded to higher-value fuels, products, and feedstocks through the fuels, lubricants, and chemical value chains.
Photo: Our world-class workforce effectively manages the complexity of our advantaged manufacturing facilities.
By maximizing integration across the full value chain, we are able to capture incremental value at transfer points or when short-term market opportunities develop. We can take advantage of logistics flexibility to ensure no value is lost to third parties. Simply put, we are uniquely positioned in industry, capturing an additional $700 million of earnings per year through integration.
We also leverage our global knowledge and expertise to inform investment decisions in each business line. For example, insights from our teams helped guide expansion plans and project designs for our Gulf Coast chemical facilities – growth supported by the integration with our rapidly growing production in the Permian.
Integration at is a competitive advantage that enables us to improve returns by responding quickly to changing market conditions. This level of flexibility is difficult to replicate.
136 cross-functional sites located in 39 countries around the world
> 35,000 employees collaborate at our cross-functional sites worldwide
Growing value and capturing savings
Nearly 80 percent of our refining capacity is integrated with chemical or lubricant manufacturing facilities. At these sites, we capture savings by:
Sharing resources
Using interconnected facilities
Coordinating operating practices
Integration also increases margins by allowing us to direct feedstocks to the highest-value products. In our Baytown manufacturing complex, lubricants and chemicals integration contributes more than 70 percent of earnings.
In Singapore, we have an integrated facility with a state-of-the-art steam cracker that produces chemicals directly from crude oil – an industry first. We can also process a range of liquid and natural gas feedstocks at the site, optimizing them for maximum value. In response to growing Asian demand for premium products, we recently added world-scale Mobil 1 lubricant blending facilities.
At the LaBarge natural gas field, extensive Downstream experience has been applied to implement a multivariable control system at the Shute Creek treating facility, increasing production and improving the purity of products. Multivariable control allows the plant to run closer to capacity and specification limits by optimizing across several operational parameters simultaneously.
Shared knowledge and capabilities
At our proposed joint venture project with near Corpus Christi, Texas, we are planning to use an approach our has implemented with great success in several projects around the world. We are constructing portions of the new facility at other locations and bringing them on site fully built. This process significantly speeds up construction, while also reducing costs by more than $1 billion.
Cross-functional sharing enables our project management professionals to influence and learn from large, complex projects, while strengthening our capabilities and providing flexibility for support of future activities. It also supports standardization and efficiency, ensuring best practices are broadly shared.
Our Houston campus brings together nearly 10,000 of our employees, fostering improved collaboration, creativity, and innovation, and accelerating the discovery of new resources, technologies, and products.

Highlight
Finding opportunities to grow
One benefit of our integration strategy is the ability to capitalize on business opportunities by expanding existing sites, rather than building new ones. This results in significant cost savings and lowers our environmental impact. For example, on the Gulf Coast, we are expanding manufacturing of high-value products at our existing sites, with a savings of more than $1 billion compared to new construction.

Maximizing asset value through operational excellence
Innovation enables us to invest in high-quality opportunities to enhance our asset portfolio. Integration helps us maximize returns across the Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical businesses. Our relentless focus on operational excellence enables us to get the most out of each and every facility, every hour, every day.

Safety is good business
safe is a well-run company. Achieving safe and environmentally responsible operations across a global enterprise requires a significant commitment from everyone at all levels of the organization. Success in safety is the result of a disciplined, rigorous approach, which also helps drive more reliable operations and improves financial results.
In 2017, we had the fewest recordable injuries in our company’s history. Our focus on identifying and eliminating high-potential-consequence events is making a difference. We also continued to achieve outstanding process safety performance, driven by a cross-functional initiative that brought together expertise from all parts of our businesses to build a unique, integrated approach to process safety.
Our operational guidelines enable field personnel to better understand the most critical safeguards and focus their efforts accordingly. Thanks to this strategy, we have sustained fewer operational upsets and releases to the environment, and we continued to exhibit strong process safety performance in 2017.
Photo: Our employees’ efforts to maximize facility capacity and improve reliability have increased the capacity of the facility more than 20 percent and made it one of the most reliable plants in the world.
Maximizing capacity and minimizing downtime
We apply the same attention, focus, and commitment to reliability as we do safety. Fewer reliability upsets reduces the potential for safety incidents. Reliability is also a key driver to profitability. Maximizing asset uptime and productivity leads to improved output and higher margins.
Introducing a multivariable control system – a technology originally used in Downstream operations – and removing bottlenecks at our facilities have enabled us to increase production 20 percent above the original facility capacity.
Our Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical businesses are among the industry leaders in reliability.

Outlook for Energy
 anticipates significant changes through 2040 to boost living standards and accelerate decarbonization of the world’s energy system to help address the risks of climate change.
          

            By 2040, the world’s population is expected to reach 9.2 billion people. Over that period, the world’s economy will likely double, helping billions of people join the middle class.
          

            Energy-efficiency improvements will help curb the growth in global energy demand to about 25 percent over the period to 2040. Efficiency gains, along with changes in the energy mix, will also help reduce the carbon intensity of global by nearly 45 percent, as nuclear and renewables, led by solar and wind, contribute nearly 40 percent of incremental energy supplies to meet demand growth.
          

            Natural gas will grow the most of any energy type; oil will continue to play a leading role in the world’s energy mix, even as electric cars become more prevalent. The International Energy Agency estimates cumulative oil and natural gas investment needs may reach approximately $21 trillion between 2017 and 2040.

Energy Factor
Welcome to Energy Factor, a daily online resource covering the cutting-edge technology and innovations that are helping to meet tomorrow’s energy needs.
Sponsored by ExxonMobil, Energy Factor uncovers the untold stories that ultimately matter to all of us as we develop safer and more reliable energy sources for the future. We highlight the communities and visionaries we collaborate with both in the and abroad to bring you informed, entertaining, and unexpected content.
We invite you to explore wide-ranging topics from the development of low-emission diesel fuel from algae, to the dramatic challenges of producing energy in some of the world’s most inhospitable places.
As we forge new paths in technology and science, Energy Factor gives you the opportunity to peer into tomorrow along with us through this bold multimedia publication.

In Egypt, as in all places we operate in the world, we seek to minimize any impact our operations may have on the environment.
Egypt supplies high-quality fuels and lubricants products. Consistently meeting technical requirements allows equipment and engines to run at peak performance, minimizing waste and avoiding unnecessary emissions.
In Egypt, Mobil and Esso service stations were pioneers in adopting state-of-the-art tanks for enhanced environmental protection. We were the first to introduce underground double-skin tanks and lines, and automatic tank gauging systems to service stations in the late 1990s to improve protection against leakage. This set the benchmark for other markets and established standards for suppliers and contractors.
Since the mid-1990s, our lubricant blending plants in Alexandria and 10th of Ramadan city have been awarded international standards certifications. Specifically, our plants, Mex in Alexandria and Asher in 10th of Ramadan city, have been awarded with the 9002 international standard certification. Finally, the stringent quality assurance systems in place in our laboratories ensure that our plants consistently meet our high standards.
Egypt regularly communicates about key issues, activities and milestones

The programs include practical lessons in physics, chemistry, integrated science and information technology, as well as a three-day science camp at a local environmental facility. We also support Youth Challenge Guyana, which provides education training to teachers and science kits to primary school students.  Over the last few years, we expanded our community support to include a university exchange program for geology students at the university of Guyana, educational programs at Women Across Differences, a sports, literacy and leadership program in a traditionally Amerindian community in region two, and teacher training for a special needs school in Georgetown.

ExxonMobil’s commitment to operating in an environmentally responsible manner is highlighted through its Corporate Environment Policy; 
Protect Tomorrow. Today
. Our policy includes a set of expectations guided by a scientific understanding of the environmental impact of our operations balanced with the social and economic needs of the communities in which we operate.
Safeguarding the ability of the environment to provide ecosystem services such as food, water, shelter, clean air and cultural identity is vital. Our approach to managing biodiversity and ecosystem services considers factors such as the rarity of individual species and their roles, vulnerabilities and cultural significance in different ecosystems and habitats. For example, Shell beach revealed environmentally sensitive species including the rare leather back turtles, which contribute to the marine ecosystems, and mangroves, which provide a nursery habitat and natural sea defense. We focus on these specifics when conducting our environmental impact assessments prior to operations.
Environmental Resources Management, a third party environmental consultant, prepared a detailed draft Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for the Liza Phase 1 Development Project (
click to view the EIA
) which was submitted on February 27, 2017. The evaluated potential environmental and socioeconomic impacts, proposed a  strategy to manage or mitigate impacts, identified project benefits, and provided the factual and technical basis to make an informed decision on Esso Exploration and Production Guyana Limited’s Application for Environmental Authorization to permit the Project.
ExxonMobil’s fundamental goal everywhere we operate, including Guyana, is to reduce environmental incidents to zero through a process of continuous improvement and the delivery of superior environmental performance. Not only do we comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations and seek to go beyond these where practical, we apply international standards where laws and regulations do not exist.

About
has had a continuous business presence in the Netherlands for more than 120 years. Our activities include exploration, production, refining, marketing and petrochemicals. ExxonMobil’s producing interests in the Netherlands, through the Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij (NAM), account for a significant part of the company’s European gas production. We also operate a refinery in Rotterdam; three chemical plants located in Rotterdam and Europoort; and a lube oil-blending plant in Pernis. Fuels and Lubricants marketing activities include a network of service stations and industrial wholesale, marine fuel and lubricant sales.

has had a presence in the United States since 1870 when John Rockefeller and his associates formed the Standard Oil (Ohio), with combined facilities constituting the largest refining capacity of any single firm in the world. Today, Exxon Mobil Corporation is the largest publicly traded international oil and gas and holds an industry-leading inventory of resources. We are also the largest refiner and marketer of petroleum products, and our chemical is one of the largest in the world.

About
We have been helping to meet energy demand in Europe for over 125 years. 
We are one of Europe's largest suppliers of oil and gas, a major refiner of crude oil for fuels and lubricants, and one of Europe's leading petrochemical companies, employing over 18,000 people across 20 European countries.
Key assets include North Sea oil and natural gas production operations, as well as onshore natural gas production in the Netherlands and Germany. In 2015, European operations accounted for 14 percent of ExxonMobil's net oil and natural gas production.
Furthermore, we market products through a network service stations, and also directly to commercial segments, such as aviation, industrial and wholesale, equipment manufacturers, and marine. European refining operations at 9 refineries represent about 30 percent of ExxonMobil's global refining capacity. This includes world-scale refineries in Antwerp, Fawley, Gravenchon and Rotterdam. European Chemical operations represent more than 15 percent of ExxonMobil's global chemical capacity.

Code of Ethics and Business Conduct
Code of Ethics and Business Conduct

        The Board maintains policies and procedures (which we refer to as our Code) that represent both the code of ethics for the principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and principal accounting officer contemplated by rules and the code of business conduct and ethics for directors, officers, and employees contemplated by listing standards.
    
The Code applies to all directors, officers, and employees. Any amendment of the Code will be promptly posted on this site. 
The Board Affairs Committee will review any issues under the Code involving an executive officer or director and will report its findings to the Board. The Board does not envision that any waivers of the Code will be granted, but should a waiver occur for an executive officer or director, it will be promptly disclosed on our website.
The Code consists of the 
Ethics Policy
, the 
Conflicts of Interest Policy
, the 
Corporate Assets Policy
, the 
Directorships Policy
 and the "Procedures and Open Door Communication" section from the 
Standards of Business Conduct
. 
The Code follows:
Ethics Policy

The policy of Exxon Mobil Corporation is to comply with all governmental laws, rules, and regulations applicable to its business.
The Corporation's Ethics policy does not stop there. Even where the law is permissive, the Corporation chooses the course of highest integrity. Local customs, traditions, and mores differ from place to place, and this must be recognized. But honesty is not subject to criticism in any culture. Shades of dishonesty simply invite demoralizing and reprehensible judgments. well-founded reputation for scrupulous dealing is itself a priceless corporate asset.
The Corporation cares how results are obtained, not just that they are obtained. Directors, officers, and employees should deal fairly with each other and with the Corporation's suppliers, customers, competitors, and other third parties.
The Corporation expects compliance with its standard of integrity throughout the organization and will not tolerate employees who achieve results at the cost of violation of law or who deal unscrupulously. The Corporation's directors and officers support, and expect the Corporation's employees to support, any employee who passes up an opportunity or advantage that would sacrifice ethical standards.
It is the Corporation's policy that all transactions will be accurately reflected in its books and records. This, of course, means that falsification of books and records and the creation or maintenance of any off-the-record bank accounts are strictly prohibited. Employees are expected to record all transactions accurately in the Corporation's books and records, and to be honest and forthcoming with the Corporation's internal and independent auditors.
The Corporation expects candor from employees at all levels and adherence to its policies and internal controls. One harm which results when employees conceal information from higher management or the auditors is that other employees think they are being given a signal that the Corporation's policies and internal controls can be ignored when they are inconvenient. That can result in corruption and demoralization of an organization. The Corporation's system of management will not work without honesty, including honest bookkeeping, honest budget proposals, and honest economic evaluation of projects.
It is the Corporation's policy to make full, fair, accurate, timely, and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Corporation files with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, and in other public communications. All employees are responsible for reporting material information known to them to higher management so that the information will be available to senior executives responsible for making disclosure decisions.
Conflicts of Interest Policy

It is the policy of Exxon Mobil Corporation that directors, officers, and employees are expected to avoid any actual or apparent conflict between their own personal interests and the interests of the Corporation. conflict of interest can arise when a director, officer, or employee takes actions or has personal interests that may interfere with his or her objective and effective performance of work for the Corporation. For example, directors, officers, and employees are expected to avoid actual or apparent conflict in dealings with suppliers, customers, competitors, and other third parties. Directors, officers, and employees are expected to refrain from taking for themselves opportunities discovered through their use of corporate assets or through their positions with the Corporation. Directors, officers, and employees are expected to avoid securities transactions based on material, nonpublic information learned through their positions with the Corporation. Directors, officers, and employees are expected to refrain from competing with the Corporation.
Corporate Assets Policy

It is the policy of Exxon Mobil Corporation that directors, officers, and employees are expected to protect the assets of the Corporation and use them efficiently to advance the interests of the Corporation. Those assets include tangible assets and intangible assets, such as confidential information of the Corporation or personal information held by the Corporation. No director, officer, or employee should use or disclose at any time during or subsequent to employment or other service to the Corporation, without proper authority or mandate, personal or confidential information obtained from any source in the course of the Corporation’s business. Examples of confidential information include nonpublic information about the Corporation’s plans, earnings, financial forecasts, business forecasts, discoveries, competitive bids, technologies, and personnel. 
Directorships Policy

It is the policy of Exxon Mobil Corporation to restrict the holding by officers and employees of directorships in nonaffiliated, for-profit organizations and to prohibit the acceptance by any officer or employee of such directorships that would involve a conflict of interest with, or interfere with, the discharge of the officer's or employee's duties to the Corporation. Any officer or employee may hold directorships in nonaffiliated, nonprofit organizations, unless such directorships would involve a conflict of interest with, or interfere with, the discharge of the officer's or employee's duties to the Corporation, or obligate the Corporation to provide support to the nonaffiliated, nonprofit organizations. Officers and employees may serve as directors of affiliated companies and such service may be part of their normal work assignments.
All directorships in public companies held by directors of the Corporation are subject to review and approval by the Board of Directors of the Corporation. In all other cases, directorships in nonaffiliated, for-profit organizations are subject to review and approval by the management of the Corporation, as directed by the Chairman.
Procedures and Open Door Communication

Exxon Mobil Corporation encourages employees to ask questions, voice concerns, and make appropriate suggestions regarding the business practices of the Corporation. Employees are expected to report promptly to management suspected violations of law, the Corporation's policies, and the Corporation's internal controls, so that management can take appropriate corrective action. The Corporation promptly investigates reports of suspected violations of law, policies, and internal control procedures.
Management is ultimately responsible for the investigation of and appropriate response to reports of suspected violations of law, policies, and internal control procedures. Internal Audit has primary responsibility for investigating violations of the Corporation's internal controls, with assistance from others, depending on the subject matter of the inquiry. The persons who investigate suspected violations are expected to exercise independent and objective judgment.
Normally, an employee should discuss such matters with the employee's immediate supervisor. Each supervisor is expected to be available to subordinates for that purpose. If an employee is dissatisfied following review with the employee's immediate supervisor, that employee is encouraged to request further reviews, in the presence of the supervisor or otherwise. Reviews should continue to the level of management appropriate to resolve the issue.
Depending on the subject matter of the question, concern, or suggestion, each employee has access to alternative channels of communication, for example, the Controller's Department; Internal Audit; the Human Resources Department; the Law Department; the Safety, Health and Environment Department; the Security Department; and the Treasurer's Department.
Suspected violations of law or the Corporation's policies involving a director or executive officer, as well as any concern regarding questionable accounting or auditing matters, should be referred directly to the General Auditor of the Corporation. The Board Affairs Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation will initially review all issues involving directors or executive officers, and will then refer all such issues to the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
Employees may also address communications to individual nonemployee directors or to the nonemployee directors as a group by writing them at Exxon Mobil Corporation, 5959 Las Colinas Boulevard, Irving, Texas 75039, U.S.A., or such other addresses as the Corporation may designate and publish from time to time.
Employees wishing to make complaints without identifying themselves may do so by telephoning 1-800-963-9966 or 1-972-444-1990, or by writing the Global Security Manager, Exxon Mobil Corporation, Box 142106, Irving, Texas 75014, U.S.A., or such other telephone numbers and addresses as the Corporation may designate and publish from time to time. All complaints to those telephone numbers and addresses concerning accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing matters will be referred to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Corporation.
All persons responding to employees' questions, concerns, complaints, and suggestions are expected to use appropriate discretion regarding anonymity and confidentiality, although the preservation of anonymity and confidentiality may or may not be practical, depending on the circumstances. For example, investigations of significant complaints typically necessitate revealing to others information about the complaint and complainant. Similarly, disclosure can result from government investigations and litigation.
No action may be taken or threatened against any employee for asking questions, voicing concerns, or making complaints or suggestions in conformity with the procedures described above, unless the employee acts with willful disregard of the truth.
Failure to behave honestly, and failure to comply with law, the Corporation's policies, and the Corporation's internal controls may result in disciplinary action, up to and including separation.
No one in the Corporation has the authority to make exceptions or grant waivers to the Corporation's foundation policies. It is recognized that there will be questions about the application of the policies to specific activities and situations. In cases of doubt, directors, officers, and employees are expected to seek clarification and guidance. In those instances where the Corporation, after review, approves an activity or situation, the Corporation is not granting an exception or waiver but is determining that there is no policy violation. If the Corporation determines that there is or would be a policy violation, appropriate action is taken.

Innovating energy solutions: and development highlights
and development highlights
has remained a leader in energy technology throughout its 135-year history. With a commitment to fundamental science and innovation unmatched in our industry, we invest about $1 billion a year in R&D.
We continue to advance a range of technologies to help meet growing demand for energy while also reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with energy use. Our in-house portfolio includes biofuels, carbon capture and storage, breakthrough energy-efficiency processes, natural gas technologies, advanced energy-saving materials and environmental life cycle assessments. We also work with leading and technology companies, national labs and universities.
Our commitment to reducing emissions doesn’t stop in the laboratory. Since 2000, has spent approximately $8 billion to develop and deploy lower-emission energy solutions across our operations.
Algae and other advanced biofuels
is actively researching biofuels made from algae. Algae naturally produce lipids that can be turned into a renewable, lower-emission fuel for transportation. The challenge is doing so economically and at scale, moving this technology from the petri dish to the fuel tank. and Synthetic Genomics Inc. continue to make progress in identifying and enhancing algae strains capable of high lipid production while maintaining desirable growth rates. And because the manufacturing processes for algae biofuels and today’s transportation fuels are similar, algae biofuels could be processed in existing refineries to supplement supplies of conventional gasoline, diesel and other fuels.
Our broad portfolio of advanced biofuels also includes biofuels derived from cellulosic biomass. We have an agreement with Renewable Energy Group Inc. to study the production of biodiesel by fermenting cellulosic sugars from sources such as agricultural waste.
Advanced, or second-generation, biofuels offer the possibility of achieving significant reductions while also minimizing the impact on land, fresh water and food supplies compared with first-generation biofuels.
Can algae biofuels be the lower-emission fuel of tomorrow?
The biofuels used around the world today are largely derived from agricultural crops; sugar cane and corn are used to make ethanol, while biodiesel is made from vegetable oils like soy. Unlike these first-generation biofuels, algae could provide a renewable fuel source that does not compete with supplies of food or fresh water. Algae also can consume carbon dioxide (CO
2
) and have the potential to be produced on a large scale.
From production to combustion, here are seven important reasons why we think the answer could be yes. Find out why this renewable energy source, which can be grown at scale on a limited amount of land, is so promising.
Algae consumes CO
2
In addition to producing algae, production sites could also act as carbon capture projects.
Lower-emission fuel
On a life cycle basis, algae biofuels emit about half as much GHGs as petroleum-derived fuel.   
High yield
Each acre of algae yields more than 2,000 gallons (7,570 liters) of fuel. Compare that to 650 gallons (2,460 liters) per acre for palm oil and 50 gallons (190 liters) per acre for soybean oil.  
Year-round harvest
Unlike other feedstocks, such as corn, which is harvested only once a year, algae can be harvested repeatedly throughout the year.
Food production
Algae can be cultivated on land unsuitable for other purposes with water that can’t be used for food production.
Water purifier
Algae can be grown in wastewater and industrial effluent, and can actually purify polluted water while simultaneously producing energy-rich biofuels.
Engine ready
Algae-derived diesel can be pumped into existing diesel automobiles without making major changes to car engines and infrastructure.

Natural gas technology
Natural gas emits up to 60 percent fewer GHGs than coal for power generation, and is an ideal source of reliable power while also supplementing intermittent renewable energy sources such as solar or wind. It also is an abundant and versatile fuel, capable of powering utilities, homes and transportation. Recent advances in production technologies – many developed by – have unlocked vast new supplies of gas in North America that previously were uneconomic to produce. is the largest natural gas producer in the U.S.
Increased use of natural gas is a major reason why energy-related CO

 emissions from the power sector are down 15 percent since 2010, and at levels not seen since the early 1990s.
also is a leader in liquefied natural gas (LNG) technology that is bringing more of this cleaner-burning fuel to countries that need it.

Carbon capture and storage
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the process by which CO
2
 that otherwise would be emitted into the atmosphere is captured, compressed and injected underground for permanent storage. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has recognized as essential to meeting global emissions-reduction goals.
remains a leader in technology. Our capacity is among the industry’s largest, with a working interest in about one-fourth of the world’s capacity. In 2016, we captured 6.3 million tonnes of CO
2
 for storage – equivalent to switching from coal to gas to meet the electricity needs of about 1 million homes.
We are conducting proprietary, fundamental to develop breakthrough technologies, with an aim to reduce the complexity and cost of this important technology, while increasing its efficiency.

Developing cutting edge technology
Fuel cell technology
is working with FuelCell Energy Inc. to explore an exciting new possibility: using carbonate fuel cells to more economically capture CO
2
 emissions from gas-fired power plants. Existing processes for capturing CO
2
 emissions consume energy, which increases costs; but carbonate fuel cells can produce electricity while they capture and concentrate CO
2
 streams. As a result, these fuel cells could significantly lower the cost of CCS, thereby bringing this breakthrough technology closer to widespread use.
Carbonate fuel cell technology could make more affordable for power plants, which according to the Environmental Protection Agency are the single largest source of emissions.
In 2016, FuelCell Energy and signed a joint agreement that will allow scientists from both companies to work collaboratively and further develop this emissions-saving technology.
How do fuel cells capture CO
2
?
Energy innovators and FuelCell Energy are collaborating on solving a big problem: how to capture CO
2
 more efficiently on a large scale. The technology we're working on uses fuel cells to separate CO
2
 from the exhaust stream of a power plant, making the CO
2
 easier to capture and pipe underground. While still in early development, this process could vastly reduce the amount of CO
2
 released into the atmosphere. It also has the potential to dramatically reduce the costs of CCS, creating a pathway for its widespread use around the world.

Chemicals process breakthrough
and Georgia Tech have developed a potentially revolutionary “reverse osmosis” technology that could significantly reduce GHGs associated with plastics manufacturing by using a molecular filter – rather than energy and heat – to perform a key step in the plastic-making process. If brought to an industrial scale, this breakthrough could reduce the industry’s global annual CO₂ emissions by up to 45 million tonnes.
Demand for auto parts, housing materials, electronics and other products made from plastics and other petrochemicals continues to grow. Rising natural gas production has boosted supplies of ethane, a natural gas liquid raw material used to make plastics, enabling investment in chemical manufacturing and exports.
Improving industrial energy efficiency and reducing emissions are part of ExxonMobil’s mission to meet the world’s needs while minimizing environmental impacts.
How does this breakthrough work?
Reverse osmosis has the potential to dramatically reduce the amount of energy required in plastics manufacturing. The technology employs a molecular-level filter – the molecules needed to produce plastics pass through; the others are recycled back into the process. This separation of molecules is a critical step in the production of plastics, but one that currently requires a lot of thermal energy. Because reverse osmosis works at room temperature, it may one day replace existing separation technology with a much less energy-intensive option.

Advanced products
develops and produces a range of advanced products that reduce emissions and improve sustainability. These include resilient, lightweight automotive plastics that reduce overall vehicle weight and advanced tire technologies that help maintain optimal tire pressure – both of which make vehicles more fuel-efficient.
also produces lightweight plastic packaging materials for everything from food to electronics. Lighter packaging means less transportation-related energy use and GHGs. Plastic packaging also helps extend the shelf life of fresh food by days or even weeks, improving safety and reducing food waste.
Our high-performance lubricants – used not just in cars and trucks, but in more than 40,000 wind turbines worldwide – improve sustainability because they need replacing less frequently, reducing the volume of used oil that needs to be disposed of or recycled.

has an impressive record of completing successful developments
High-impact drilling and completion technologies

                            Advances in technologies used for well drilling and completion have enabled the energy industry to reach new sources of oil and natural gas to meet rising demand around the world. New technologies have also helped reduce the environmental impact of energy production by allowing more oil and gas to be produced with fewer wells.

2017 Sustainability Report
Introduction
has a long-standing commitment to high ethical standards.

      Good corporate governance creates a business environment conducive to long-term growth. All our directors are required to stand for election each year at our annual meeting of shareholders. Independent directors also chair key board committees – audit, compensation, board affairs and public issues and contributions – that consist entirely of independent directors.
    
ExxonMobil’s board of directors provides a key oversight role, including review of risk management efforts and long-term strategic plans. Ensuring that we have diversity of background, experiences and thought represented on the board remains critical to succeeding in a global market.

Water management
Freshwater management
Protecting and preserving freshwater resources involves understanding supply and demand trends at the local level and implementing appropriate measures to address any potential impacts on water quality and quantity. Throughout our projects and operations, works to prudently utilize freshwater resources.
Our Water Management Standard applies to our and Downstream businesses and helps manage water quality and quantity issues. From an perspective, the Standard requires a risk assessment, including an assessment of local water resources and potential mitigation actions at the project development stage. For the Downstream business, the Standard helps ensure that we meet internal discharge standards, in the case that the country has no standards or less stringent standards than our internal specifications.
We continuously work to improve our understanding of water consumption, including when and how much. Using the latest version of a water tool developed by IPIECA, the global oil and gas industry association for environmental and social issues, we identified that 37 percent of our major operating sites are in areas with the potential for water scarcity. Therefore, we pursue site-specific management strategies such as the deployment of water conservation technologies, the use of alternative water sources, recycling of municipal and industrial wastewater, substitution with lower-quality water sources and harvesting of rainwater.
In our onshore operations, water consumption is primarily associated with hydraulic fracturing which uses water pressure to create small cracks or fissures in rocks deep underground so that oil or natural gas can flow to the well. The industry has more than 60 years of experience with the technique and safety remains a top focus. Water use by basin differs due to geologic and reservoir characteristics and optimization of drilling and completion designs.

Performance and initiatives
In 2017, the net freshwater consumption at our operations was 300 million cubic meters, an increase of about 4 percent from the 2016 consumption of 290 million cubic meters and about a 20 percent decline since 2011. ExxonMobil’s total freshwater consumption includes use by refineries and chemical plants, oil and gas production, and onshore shale resources development in the United States.
Freshwater intensity is the ratio of net freshwater consumption to the amount of throughput or production.
Chart
 — ExxonMobil's global freshwater consumption in 2017 was 300 million cubic meters. This represents roughly a 10 million cubic meter increase when compared to our 2016 global freshwater consumption. 
*We report freshwater intensity alongside consumption data in our performance data. Data include Energy data beginning in 2011. 
In 2017, affiliate Energy joined five oil and gas companies in a partnership with the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation to support conservation projects in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. The Pecos Watershed Conservation Initiative aims to identify significant conservation opportunities that address terrestrial and aquatic habitat restoration, water scarcity and water quality, as well as other issues related to long-term conservation. The participating companies have committed a combined $3.5 million over three years in initial funding for on-the-ground conservation projects.
Wastewater management
Produced water from onshore oil and gas operations is typically managed by injection into deep underground reservoirs. For offshore production facilities, produced water is managed by reinjection into an associated reservoir or by treatment and discharge into the marine environment in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.

For our projects, our Water Management Standard outlines minimum expected environmental performance and mitigation measures. This Standard establishes the planning and design basis for reducing impacts to surface waters, ground waters and estuarine and marine waters, as well as to the associated habitats and users, related to discharge quality of produced water. For our Downstream and Chemical operations, we work to ensure new facilities are designed to control quality of discharged effluents.
Performance and initiatives
Spotlight: Reducing nitrate flow to the Mississippi River
In recent years, there have been substantial efforts to regulate the amount of nitrates released into the Mississippi River because of the increase in “dead zones” occurring in the Gulf of Mexico. Dead zones, or areas in the ocean with low oxygen concentration, can cause negative impacts to marine life.
ExxonMobil’s Baton Rouge refinery, situated along the Mississippi River, is the third-largest refinery in the United States. Starting in 2014, we invested approximately $10 million in capital infrastructure development to reduce nitrates sent to the Mississippi River from the Baton Rouge wastewater treatment plant. ExxonMobil’s voluntary investment goes well beyond any regulatory requirements.
In response to these efforts, in 2017 the Environmental Protection Agency’s Gulf of Mexico Program announced the Baton Rouge refinery won a second-place Gulf Guardian Award for innovation in reducing nitrogen pollution in its wastewater. This award recognizes businesses that are taking positive steps to keep the Gulf healthy and productive.
We have plans to expand this focus on nitrogen pollution reduction to the Billings refinery in Montana by upgrading the local wastewater treatment plant to have the capacity to remove nitrates from water that passes through the facility.
Seismicity
Seismicity refers to the occurrence or frequency of earthquakes in a region. Earthquakes are caused mostly by natural processes.  
has a comprehensive risk management approach in place to limit induced seismicity from our operations by evaluating the relative risks associated with the specific geological and geographic context  of a site. We employ a team of experts that assess factors such as fluid volume, formation character, tectonic setting, operating experience and local building construction approaches. We use computer modeling and other advanced tools to best understand local conditions and minimize potential impacts of our operations.  
Performance and initiatives 
We work with academic and government researchers and regulatory agencies to share our knowledge and advanced approaches. For example, and Stanford University jointly developed a  software modeling tool to assess the potential risk of induced seismicity and made it freely available to government and industry. The tool is being used by regulatory agencies and energy companies to help reduce the risk of human-induced seismicity.
We authored and co-authored more than 20 presentations and publications in this field in 2016 and 2017. As an example, contributed information and expertise to update a 
comprehensive technical and regulatory report
 with the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission and the Ground Water Protection Council. The report provides knowledge and practices for managing the risk of induced seismicity.
is also proactively pursuing ongoing collaborative on this topic through funding consortiums at Stanford University, University of Texas and the Universities of Alberta and Calgary. In 2017, started a three-year collaboration with Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The goal of this program is to improve our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms responsible for induced seismicity.
