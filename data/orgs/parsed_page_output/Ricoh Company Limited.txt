Its printers, copiers and fax machines spearheaded the era of office automation and revolutionized business operations. More recently, managed document services have established Ricoh's reputation as a global document expert.

With Ricoh's technical ability and knowledge on their team, these companies can reduce costs, eliminate waste and streamline processes—yielding tangible benefits for their own customers.

It is creating solutions that answer local needs and breathing new life into established forms of knowledge sharing. Through cloud computing, remote monitoring, and other innovations, is making information more mobile, and more personal. Its consumer products are also enhancing the way people interact with the world around them, whether through an award-winning line of digital cameras, or online data storage services.

Founder Kiyoshi Ichimura
Ricoh’s origins date back to a decision by the Institute of Physical and Chemical Research to commercialize the              fruits of its R&by setting up Rikagaku Kogyo. Since its formation in 1927, the business venture has placed              on the market numerous products developed by the research institute, including sensitized paper. On February              6, 1936, the sensitized paper division was split off to be established as Riken Kankoshi Co., Ltd., a precursor              of Ricoh, under the directorship of Kiyoshi Ichimura (1900-1968). As the founder of Ricoh, Ichimura led the              successful development of the business that started with 350,000 yen in capital and a staff of 33.
Kiyoshi Ichimura formulated The Spirit of Three Loves: “ Love your neighbor,” “ Love your country,” “Love your              work,” and ever since, they have been respected as the Group’s Founding Principles, which provide every              employee with a guide for business and encourage individuals to constantly improve and contribute to the wellbeing              of all stakeholders, including families, customers, and society at large.

was awarded the Okochi Memorial Production Prize for the successful establishment of a mass production               system (1957)
was the first in Japan to introduce a belt-conveyor system for manufacturing cameras, achieving              a production capacity of 10,000 units/month—more than ten times the capacity of the then standard level of less              than 1,000 units/month from the conventional handicraft industry. Successfully adopting this method of camera              mass production, offered the Ricohflex Model at an affordable price, which was remarkably low for              an iconic luxury item in those days. This model became highly popular among Japanese consumers, reportedly representing              more than 50% of total national camera production during its sales peak.

The new DT1200 was developed to satisfy the ever-higher expectations of users for plain-paper copiers              (PPCs) at that time. We offered this model with confidence as a reflection of its strong features, namely, a              single touch switch between two different paper size feeders, marking the first time that such a function had              ever been employed for popular model PPCs; a liquid development method employed to consume the entire supply              of toner loaded in the machine; and stable functionality for quality results, proven even with one million pages              running consecutively, thus reducing the amount of required maintenance work. These superior specifications              were highly regarded by many users, particularly in the USA, where in general, availability of maintenance service              was geographically limited. In 1991, the DT1200 was enshrined in the nation’s Copier Hall of Fame to              acknowledge the significant role the product played in the history of wet-type copier development.

Research and Development Center was founded as one of the commemorative events of the company’s 50th anniversary.              It was set up to become the core function of the company’s multi-lab project to enhance its system for comprehensive              R&activities from the long-term perspective. The center opened on April 23, 1986 within the Kohoku New Town              district in Yokohama. The facilities cover a total area of 16,700㎡ and include not only a range of laboratories              for precision measurement and analysis as well as clean rooms, but also spaces designed to encourage researchers’              inventive efforts and interactions. The establishment serves as Ricoh’s key R&base that undertakes a full              range of activities, from basic and applied studies to commercial use research.
320 (1987)
Before the 320 was launched, the commercial photocopier market was dominated by monochrome analog models,              with digital models marginalized due to unaffordable unit prices (exceeding 2 million yen on average) and extremely              large sizes that prevented their installation in standard offices. To overcome these challenges, developed              the 320, a more compact and affordable digital copier for office use. We reduced the body dimensions              to a practical size and brought the price down to below 1 million yen. In addition, we incorporated multiple              advanced features into the model, including functions to reproduce unprecedented image quality, an extensive              image editor selection, automatic control, and multifunctionality to enable operational interaction with other              office equipment. Being more practical, sophisticated and less costly, the product sold well over 20,000 units              in its first 12 months, making it a massive hit.

Based on this agreement, the constructed the Olympic Fax Network to connect the              International Olympic Committee (IOC) to around 40 related sports associations in 167 countries. This worldwide              network greatly enhanced international communication among the organizations involved, which previously had              to rely on postal and telex systems to exchange messages. Through this project, we were able to contribute considerably              to a more accurate, speedy and smoother Olympic Games.
Introduces 8000, Ricoh’s first digital color copier
Foursome drive developed by Ricoh, adopting a “one-scan, four-beam, four drum tandem” system
8000 (1990)
The standard technology adopted for color copiers around 1990 required repeated imaging processing for four colors              (cyan, magenta, yellow, and black) loaded on a single drum to reproduce one color copy. This was a time-consuming              process, taking about five minutes on average to make one A4-page copy. Identifying an opportunity in this limitation,              developed a four-drum photoreceptor system that could process the four colors in tandem, which was a vital              function built into the new digital color model. The resulting 8000 boasted the capability of an outstanding              high-speed color printing output of 15 ppm, which was the world’s fastest at that time. The product was also              designed to accept various paper types. The introduction of 8000 increased the availability of the color              duplication option in routine office operations.

Spirio 2700, recyclable design model that has adopted a number of measures to improve efficiency in the recycling               process, such as a reduced number of screws, unified plastic materials, and compatible decal labels developed               to eliminate the need for removal
Recycling centers were built in the Kanto and Kyushu regions for disassembling and sorting components of collected               used copiers as a part of efforts for energy reduction and recycling
In the early 1990s, began to promote sustainable environmental management on a full scale, implementing              a variety of activities. One of the key initiatives was the introduction of a recyclable product design. For              copy machines, around 20% of the weight of an entire unit is composed of plastic parts, which previously did              not undergo disassembly and sorting for reuse since used units were wholly destroyed and disposed of. In 1993,              in order to reduce this waste by improving the parts recycling rate, we formulated a recyclable design policy              and product assessment system. Our first recyclable design copier was released in 1994. These efforts won public              recognition, including the highest prize from the Minister of International Trade and Industry for environmental              activities for product assessment and recyclable design in the recycling project award hosted by the Clean Japan              Center in 1995. The recyclable design initiative took root in as a continual driver of its sustainable
DC-1 (1995)
Compact and lightweight body achieved through functional integration
DC-1, which employed Ricoh’s proprietary image processing technology that had been developed primarily              for office automation systems to achieve integrated processing of image and non-image data, pioneered a new              front in the digital camera market. This pioneering model featured a handy pocket-size body that housed a set              of then leading-edge functions (that have now become standard) such as zoom, data communication, and video recording              with sound. Also, to offer the option of data transfer to PCs, necessary applications and image recording media were developed to specifically serve the purpose of this model.
imagio MF200, a global digital copier success story (1996)
The imagio MF200 realized the turning point in the history of copy machines by sparking the dramatic transition              from analog to digital models. It featured digital-enabled high-definition quality, memory for storing data              to be copied, a compact body (for an A3-paper support model) with the world’s smallest width at that time as              well as lower unit prices achieved through rigorous cost cutting efforts. Because of all these outstanding features,              the imagio MF200 was particularly popular with smaller corporate users, enjoying enormous sales and becoming              a record-breaking hit. Following the rollout of this machine, the digital segment increased to exceed the analog              segment in terms of shipment volume in the Japanese market. In the global copier sector, this event provided              momentum supporting the trend toward the shift to digital technologies on a large scale.

Establishes the Technology Center, a development base for MFPs/printers, in Ebina, Kanagawa Prefecture
Collaboration space in the Technology Center
Technology Center
Technology Center was established to consolidate development functions for imaging and solutions products              (MFPs, printers, etc.) that were formerly located in separate sites in Japan, including the Ohmori Plant (Tokyo)              and Atsugi Plant (Kanagawa Prefecture), into a single center. The organizational integration was planned to              streamline activities in a range of development areas, from element technology and production technology to              product assessment, spurring cross-divisional, cross-functional activities, thereby improving development efficiency.
Pxtoner mass-production plant
Pxtoner is a polymerized toner with polyester developed by Ricoh, applying its original ester elongation method.              While offering higher-definition quality achieved by fine, uniform and highly shape-controllable particles,              this toner allows for lower-temperature fixing, thereby contributing to energy-saving machine operations. In              addition, CO
2
emissions stemming from the manufacturing process can be reduced to around 65% of those of conventional              ground toners. To start mass production of the Pxtoner, a new plant was constructed on the premises of our              Numazu Plant in Shizuoka Prefecture.

Billboard on top of the San-ai Dream Center lit up
San-ai Dream Center is a commercial facility which was completed in January 1963. The project was organized by              Kiyoshi Ichimura, the founder of Ricoh, who wished to create a symbolic structure of the San-ai Group.              In 2006, a new billboard was installed on top of the building in celebration of the 70th anniversary of Ricoh’s              founding. The lighting installation was designed to present a vibrant image of new sprouts shooting and flower              buds opening under the theme of “birth and growth.” This was replaced in September 2014 by the present 100%              natural energy powered billboard.

SV-M-S1
Ricoh’s camera lineup
SV-M-S1, rolled out by Industrial Solutions Inc., is an industrial-use stereo camera system for high-speed,              high-accuracy 3measurement. It is intended for use in supporting the automated control of a system through              3measurement of related objects, or figuratively, playing the role of the “eye” of the system. The product              boasts a high precision range of ± 0.1% (actual measurement value), which was achieved by applying Ricoh’s refined              calibration technology. And its high frame rate of 30 fps designed for 3measurements has been made possible              by incorporating functions related to a range of processes from photographic image processing to parallax computation              into the main structure from which it works, thereby delivering faster data processing. SV-M-S1 is offered from              Ricoh’s broad lineup of camera systems for factory automation (FA).

600S
600coming off the line at the Atsugi Plant
The 600was awarded the “One Step on Electro-Technology” prize by The Institute of Electrical Engineers              of Japan. The reason for the award was that the 600could transmit an A4 standard page in one minute,              six times faster than the analog facsimile. It greatly contributed to facsimile popularization. This digital              technology set an international standard and led to the development of a multifunctional printer that combined              copying, printing, scanning and facsimile functions in one unit. Consequently, it promoted the progress of Office              Automation equipment and innovated effective office work.

The Group, drawing on its technological              prowess, has entered the healthcare field to help overcome these challenges. We acquired the magnetoencephalography*              business of Yokogawa Electric Corporation in April 2016.
* Magnetoencephalography maps the neural activity of the brain
Here, our three key focuses are on medical imaging, healthcare information technology, and biomedical domains.              We will combine the medical equipment development and business knowhow we secured through that acquisition with              the imaging technology, systems design capabilities, and production expertise of our core operations to help              prevent, swiftly identify and treat illnesses, and in doing so help resolve social issues.
resource recycling exhibit
The “Eco Business Development Center” was founded as a project to commemorate the company’s 80th anniversary.              This center has three major functions: the “Reuse & Recycling Center”, a “center for verification of eco-business              technologies”; and a “source to distribute information regarding eco-business activities”.
The center for verification of eco-business technologies harnesses open innovation between industry, academia,              and government in collaboration with partners to accelerate the creation of eco businesses. Since the 1990s,              has focused its efforts on “environmental management” to simultaneously reduce environmental impact and              create additional sources of revenue & profit. The will further advance the scope of this “environmental              management” and aims to create eco-businesses in a broader range of fields, not to the domains it has              focused on in the past. This will further evolve with customers, who will contribute to achieving a more sustainable              society.To view this website correctly, please ensure you have

EMPOWERING
WORKPLACES
In 2017, the group created a new brand promise for our customers: “WORKPLACES”.
Empowering Digital Workplaces means connecting people to information faster and more conveniently to improve communication and creativity.
This is based on the “San-Ai Spirit” - The Spirit of Three Loves: Love your neighbor, Love your country, Love your work - which the has followed since it was established in 1936.
At we are constantly thinking about people and how to help them work more creatively for a more satisfying life.
The first Japanese copy machine transformed the workplace by helping people to transmit information accurately and quickly without the time-wasting and life-sapping tedium of endlessly reproducing business documents.
The first fax machine enabled the transmission of information to extend beyond mere hand-to-hand delivery to cross cities, countries, and the world in seconds and connect people everywhere.
These breakthroughs were the birth of what we now call “office automation”. This evolved from simple document creation, duplication, and delivery to changing the entire workflow with copying, printing, information communication, storage and search, and an endless series of workplace innovations.
As times changed, technology advanced. But there are still many problems to be solved around workers, society and social interaction. will provide more solutions with “WORKPLACES”.

Our thoughts
Printing beyond printing
What will the role of printing be in the future?
We are considering how to bring printing deep into people’s lives.
We see the possibility of digital printing that can inspire the power
of the human imagination, help fulfill people’s dreams
and solve many of the world’s problems.
Today, we are giving communication a new value not
just on paper, but on all kinds of mediums such as fabrics,
building materials and even food.
We are moving people’s minds by this “display printing.”
Now we can even achieve digital printing that forms cells,
medicines and battery parts.
This "applied printing” has powerful life-changing effects.
At we create printing that relates to all our lives,
and by using our digital technology we are already delivering
a more abundant future for everyone.
New digital possibilities for business and society
Even if digital is advanced in your workplace,
it is meaningless if you can’t make the most of its advantages.
Data only becomes valuable information when it touches “human emotions”:
for example, by connecting offices and frontlines by digitizing workflows and communications
and reforming the entire work process.
And also by storing conversations and movements in the workplace
and transforming them into visible information that everyone can see.
is now opening the door to new ways to connect workers and information,
that shed light on the possibilities that are hidden in every business field and society
and opening eyes and minds to improvements in workflow and communication.
This leads to greater collaboration and solutions to social challenges.
We support a new style of “working” by “giving shape to new digital possibilities for future”.
Connecting for Sustainability
～Driving Sustainability for Our Future～
By connecting workers and information, we create workplace solutions that, in turn, resolve social challenges.
We help to realize the prosperity of companies and enhance society at the same time.
Based on this approach since was founded in 1936, we, along with all our group employees, have always taken on challenging tasks that are ahead of their time.
This has formed our concept to balance the relationship between the economy (Prosperity), society (People) and the environment (the Planet). We call this the “Three Ps Balance”.
In 2017, we decided to tackle five key issues based on the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): “Productivity Enhancement”, “Intelligence Creation”, “Enhancement”, “Zero-carbon Society”, and a “Circular Economy”.
The Group will connect all the solutions we are striving to develop by  everywhere, to create a truly sustainable society.To view this website correctly, please ensure you have

Message from Management
The Group will accelerate innovation through agile technology development.
Tadashi Furushima,
Corporate Vice Presidents
With advancements in innovation across all sectors globally, it is becoming increasingly important to develop technologies that are able to resolve issues facing customers and society at large quickly.
The Group is now working to create new value using its core technologies, nurtured over many years, including its printing technology. has evolved its printing technology from display printing on materials such as paper, fabric, film, building materials, and décor, to applied printing using innovative materials for devices/modules and bio 3printing. These developments allow to tackle complex social issues, which is already showing some positive results.
Moreover, through the combination of our smart edge devices and Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Group is focusing efforts on the creation of workplaces that add value, whether in an office, on the factory floor, or further afield across society.
Innovation is essential for the rapid realization of these initiatives. The Group actively promotes cooperation and collaboration with universities, research institutes, and companies, including venture businesses, demonstrating Ricoh's commitment to dynamically breaking through existing frameworks and accepted practices.
As supporters of innovation, the Group remains committed to “WORKPLACES” by seizing the opportunity to deliver technologies that the customer desires and that society requires.
