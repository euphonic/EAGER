About Us
Devices’ core business is the design and manufacture of III-epitaxial material used in cellular phones and other wireless devices, and the design and manufacture of solar cells and solar sheets for a variety of applications, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), spacecraft, and terrestrial collectors. 
Founded in 2000, is well equipped to conduct its business.  The company occupies a 30,000 square foot facility in Niles, a northern suburb of Chicago, Illinois.  The facility contains a clean room and device fabrication and test laboratory.  owns all the tools and equipment necessary to grow, fabricate, and test epitaxial material and solar cells and sheets.  The company owns a set of metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) tools capable of high volume production.  also possesses the tools and equipment required to fabricate and test semiconductor device structures and solar cells. 
is dedicated to producing quality products to meet customer needs.  is an 9001-certified company.  Production begins only after we are sure that all required customer specifications have been met.  In order to ensure the quality of our products, we employ sophisticated quality control processes. 
prides itself on the quality of its employees.  Some members of our technical staff are among the world’s foremost experts in the growth and processing of GaAs- and InP-based electronic and solar cells.  Our staff supports customers, not only during the product development period, but also during production in order to enable continuing improvements in final product performance and yield. 
also performs contract research and development.  Since 2003, has been a prime federal contractor on more than thirty programs to develop solar cells, transistors, and lasers.  key result of this innovation has been the development of the epitaxial lift-off (ELO) process, which uses in its line of solar cell and solar sheet products.  has also supported other companies in the performance of their research and development programs.  Many of the innovations developed at have been incorporated into commercial products.
