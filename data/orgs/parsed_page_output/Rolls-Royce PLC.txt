pioneers cutting-edge technologies that deliver the cleanest, safest and most competitive solutions to meet our planet’s vital power needs
We are one of the world’s leading industrial technology companies.
Throughout our history, we have set out to achieve extraordinary goals. Along the way, we have developed ground-breaking technologies, established new standards and shaped the world we live in. This quest has taken us from our founding expertise in internal combustion engines to providing the world’s most powerful and efficient aero-engines.

We are one of the world’s leading industrial technology companies.
Throughout our history, we have set out to achieve extraordinary goals. Along the way, we have developed ground-breaking technologies, established new standards and shaped the world we live in. This quest has taken us from our founding expertise in internal combustion engines to providing the world’s most powerful and efficient aero-engines.
We have always pursued ever cleaner, safer and more competitive power. Now, the size and impact of the markets we serve make this task more urgent than ever. The transition to a low carbon global economy is spurring us to develop new technologies and capabilities. Today, we are combining distinct engineering disciplines to produce state-of-the-art electromechanical and hybrid power systems. The growth of electrification will form a new chapter in our history.
At the same time, the rapid pace of digitalisation offers substantial and wide-ranging opportunities. Over twenty years ago, we were the first to use sensors to collect live, commercial
data to allow real-time engine health monitoring. Today, we aim to be Digital First in everything we do.
We are committed to an environment where all our employees are able to give their best. Our success has been a result of the commitment, skills and ingenuity of our employees and their determination to be Trusted to Deliver Excellence. Electrification and digitalisation will require new talents and behaviours.
We can only prosper with the support of our key stakeholders. We strive to outperform their expectations of us.
We believe in the positive, transforming potential of technology.
We are – pioneering the power that matters.
Context for our vision
As pioneers, we must continuously innovate to provide the best solutions in the markets we serve. This requires us to anticipate the opportunities and challenges that our
customers will face. In the coming years, we believe that three key trends will define the world’s future power needs.
Context for our vision
As pioneers, we must continuously innovate to provide the best solutions in the markets we serve. This requires us to anticipate the opportunities and challenges that our
customers will face. In the coming years, we believe that three key trends will define the world’s future power needs.
The first trend is 
growing demand for cleaner, safer and more competitive power
. Global economic growth and rising prosperity will lead to increased demand for travel, trade and energy. To provide superior power for our customers, we will continuously develop and apply cutting-edge technologies.
The second trend is 
electrification
. As we move to a low carbon global economy, our engines will become part of broader, hybrid systems with lower emissions. To provide solutions for our customers, we will act as a system integrator, combining our traditional mechanical technology with electrical technology.
The third trend is 
digitalisation
. Advances in sensors, communication, data storage, processing power, machine learning, artificial intelligence, robotics and additive layer manufacturing are all combining to create new insights, new processes and new opportunities. To provide lifelong performance for our customers, we will use the huge potential of digitalisation to transform our activities.
These trends will provide opportunities for new entrants to compete in our markets. As pioneers, we must be the disruptors, challenging conventional approaches and championing new solutions.

About
Our Research
Our Research
With a growing portfolio of products and an increasingly comprehensive range of services, our investment in Research and Technology is a key focus.
Vision
Two-thirds of our investment is aimed at improving the environmental performance of our products, for example investing in low-carbon technologies like nuclear energy.
key element in our approach to technology acquisition is our three-phase Vision Programme. Developing the right technologies means looking far into the future and generating a vision of what the needs of our customers will be. Technology acquisition is therefore planned over three time horizons:
Vision 5 - applying technology
Vision 5 describes the technologies that we currently have available 'off-the-shelf'. They will be incorporated into new products, such as the aero Trent gas turbine, while some existing engines will be modified to incorporate these proven technologies. Vision5 will ensure that current products remain market leaders in every aspect of performance, reliability and cost.
Vision 10 - the next generation
Vision 10 embodies technologies currently at the validation stage which are due to be commercially available in the medium-term to up to ten years from now. The next generation of our market-leading products will rely largely on Vision10 technologies.
Vision 20 - exploring new ideas
Vision 20 technologies target future generations of products in a 20-year timeframe. These are at the strategic research stage – emerging or as yet unproven – but will ensure that we are prepared for future market developments by focusing our extensive research base (including universities and institutions) on the technology requirements of future generations of products.
Advanced Manufacturing Research Centres
The Axnetwork is comprised of seven Advanced Manufacturing Research Centres helping us and other industrial partners achieve Best in Class capability across our portfolio of manufacturing technologies.
Research and University Technology Centres
We have an established global network of research centres. Each centre addresses a key technology; and collectively they tackle a wide range of engineering disciplines.

grew from the electrical and mechanical business established by Henry Royce in 1884. Royce built his first motor car in 1904 and in May of that year met Charles Rolls, whose company sold quality cars in London.
An agreement was reached that Royce Limited would manufacture a range of cars to be exclusively sold by Rolls & Co – they were to bear the name Rolls-Royce.
Success with the cars led to the formation of the company in March 1906 and to the launch of the six-cylinder Silver Ghost which, within a year, was hailed as 'the best car in the world'.
At the start of the First World War, in response to the nation's needs, Royce designed his first aero engine – the Eagle, providing some half of the total horsepower used in the air war by the allies.
The Eagle powered the first direct transatlantic flight as well as the first flight from England to Australia – both in the Vickers Vimy aircraft.
The late 1920s saw us develop the 'R' engine to power Britain's entry in the International Schneider Trophy seaplane contest. It established a new world air speed record of over 400mph in 1931.
Subsequently it established new world records on both land and water. More importantly, as subsequent events were to prove, it gave us the technological base to develop the Merlin, which Royce has begun to work on before his death in 1933.
The Merlin powered the Hawker Hurricane and Supermarine Spitfire in the Battle of Britain. Demand for the Merlin during the Second World War transformed us from a relatively small company into a major contender in aero propulsion.
In parallel, we began development of the aero gas turbine, pioneered by Sir Frank Whittle.
The Welland engine entered service in the Gloster Meteor fighter in 1944 and we had the confidence immediately after the war to commit ourselves to the gas turbine, in which it had a technological lead.
We entered the civil aviation market with the Dart in the Vickers Viscount. It was to become the cornerstone of universal acceptance of gas turbines by the airline industry.
The Avon-powered Comet became the first turbojet to enter transatlantic service and in 1960, the Conway engine in the Boeing 707 became the first turbofan to enter airline service.
The other major manufacturers in Britain between the wars were Armstrong Siddeley, Blackburn, Bristol, de Havilland and Napier.
The leader among these was Bristol which, in 1959, merged with the motor car and aero-engine maker Armstrong Siddeley. Three other smaller engine companies were absorbed into Bristol Siddeley and in 1961.
Finally, the capability of the British aero-engine industry was consolidated when we merged with Bristol Siddeley in 1966.
With the emergence of the widebody airliners in the late 1960s, we launched the RB211 for the Lockheed L-1011 Tri-Star.
Early problems with the RB211 led to the company being taken into state ownership, and the flotation of the motor car business in 1973 as a separate entity.
The three-shaft turbofan concept of the RB211 has now established itself at the heart of our world-class family of engines.
We returned to the private sector, undergoing a number of mergers and acquisitions to create the only company in Britain capable of delivering power for use in the air, at sea and on land.
In 1990, we formed an aero engines joint venture with of Germany. 
We took full control of the joint venture from January 2000. The legal name of the company is now Deutschland Ltd & Co KG.
Allison Engine Company in Indianapolis was acquired. 
Allison brought with it major new civil engines including the AE3007 for Embraer's new regional jet, and existing, successful defence programmes.
Motor Cars was sold by Vickers to Volkswagen, although hold the rights to the name and the marque for use on cars, having acquired the rights from for £40m in 1998.
took over responsibility for cars from the beginning of 2003.
We took full control of our oil and gas joint venture, Cooper Rolls, with the acquisition of the rotating compression equipment interests of Cooper Energy Services. 
We also acquired National Airmotive in California, a major repair and overhaul facility now part of Engine Services.
The 1990s ended with the £576m acquisition of Vickers which, with primarily the Ulstein and Kamewa products and capabilities joining the our existing gas turbine activities, transformed us into the global leader in marine power systems.
We celebrated our centenary throughout 2004 with a series of special events for customers, partners from education and industry, as well as employees, families and friends in the UK, Germany, Scandinavia North America and the Far East.
We opened our 6,000 square metre Marine facility in Shanghai.
Located in the Nanhui industrial zone in Shanghai, the facility is equipped with specialised machinery and a 200-strong workforce, including a growing team of service engineers.
The revolutionary tiltrotor aircraft known as the V-22 Osprey went into its first operational use with the Marine Corps, transforming troop deployment.
The Trent 1000 is the only engine optimised specifically for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. It ran for the first time in 2006.
The MT30 marine gas turbine was selected to power the Navy’s first two DDG-1000 multi-mission destroyers.
In October the Trent 900 was the first engine to power the Airbus A380 into service with Singapore Airlines. The A380 is the world’s largest airliner and has four engines per aircraft.
In 2009 work began on a manufacturing and assembly facility at Crosspointe in the United States. 
The decision to build a large-engine assembly plant and a new wide-chord fan blade factory in Seletar, Singapore, was announced, the first of these to be built outside the UK.
We celebrated the first flight of six of our customers’ aircraft: the Boeing 787; Gulfstream G650; Airbus A400M; Embraer Legacy 650, the Systems Mantis and the AgustaWestland Lynx Wildcat helicopter.
marine power saw the Navy’s Littoral Combat Ship go on active duty, the first sailing of the Royal Navy’s Astute class submarine and the commissioning of the Royal Navy’s first Type 45 Destroyer, Daring.
The engine for the Airbus A350, the Trent XWB, ran for the first time in June. 
At this point 1,150 Trent engines were already on order promising to make the Trent the most successful member of the Trent family.
Our naval business secured a breakthrough order from the Navy to power 10 Littoral Combat Ships with MT30 marine gas turbine engines. This represents the largest naval surface vessel contract the Group has signed to this date. In the UK, six Type 45 Destroyers for the Royal Navy are launched, equipped with our highly-efficient WR-21 gas turbine power system.
Early in 2010, the short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) version of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter deployed our unique LiftSystem® for the first time.
The Trent 1000 is the first engine to power Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which went into service on 26 October 2011 with All Nippon Airways (ANA).
The 1,000
th
 production Trent 700 engine is delivered to Cathay Pacific in November.
In May 2011, the Government awarded us the contract to develop a new propulsion system for the next generation of nuclear-powered submarines.
The short take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) variant of the F-35Lightning Joint Strike Fighter entered service with the Marine Corps and deliveries were made to the MoD.
The Apprentice Academy opened in Rolls-Royce, Derby, on the 2nd November 2012, equipped with workshops containing the very latest machines, tooling and software to help train the high-class engineers of the future.
The Trent engine takes to the skies for the first time on an Airbus A380 test aircraft in Toulouse, France. The aircraft flew with one of its four Trent 900 engines replaced by the Trent XWB.
Tognum, which makes high-speed reciprocating engines becomes part of under the name Power Systems.

Our Strategy
Our strategy
The strategy takes into account the trends that will define the world’s future power needs.
Our strategy consists of five elements:
Champion electrification
We will invest in new power solutions for our long-term success.
We are building on our strong heritage in mechanical engineering to produce state-of-the-art electro-mechanical and hybrid power systems. Today, we already combine our engines in hybrid systems for trains, ships and micro-grids.
Vitalise existing capabilities
We will develop next generation technologies to sustain and grow our current competitiveness.
We are investing in our existing thermomechanical products to ensure that they provide the cleanest, safest and most competitive solutions for our customers. For example, the UltraFan® represents a fundamental upgrade of our gas turbines, incorporating eleven breakthrough technologies.
Reinvent with digital
We will be Digital First in everything we do to generate new insights, new solutions and new opportunities.
We are renowned as a pioneer in the use of digital solutions for our customer care. We are continuously enhancing the digital twin of our physical activities and seeking new data innovations.
Transform our business
We will fundamentally change the way we do business to generate substantial value for our stakeholders.
We are implementing and improving the Operating System. Digitalisation allows us to create entirely new ways of engineering, manufacturing and serving our customers across the Group.
Build balanced portfolio
We will seek new markets and products that bring new technologies and capabilities, and generate scale and synergies.
We are investing to manage the transition towards electrification and digitalisation. We mitigate the risk of long-term investment by increasing our preparedness. For example, by developing activities where electrification is relevant today, such as micro-grids, we will be better placed to benefit in activities where electrification is still some years away, such as aero-engines.
Our business system
To implement our strategy, we have refined the business system that we use across all of our Business Units. It is a virtuous cycle driven by the ability of technology
to create growth opportunities.
Our business system consists of five stages:
Cutting-edge technologies
Resilient business
Dynamic technology management
Long-term value creation
Compelling customer propositions

Cutting-edge technologies
Cutting-edge technology allows us to meet emerging customer needs. We instinctively pursue new technologies that will help us deliver cleaner, safer and more competitive solutions.
We identify the key horizon technologies that will generate a competitive advantage for in the long-term.
Resilient business
Our activities have a major impact on our planet, the global economy and on communities. To ensure that we are free to operate and invest for the longterm, we are thoughtful and careful about the business we undertake, our financial resources and our wider impact.
We build balance in our activities, strength in our balance sheet and behave sustainably.
Dynamic technology management
Our future technological world is complex with many exciting new challenges across everything we do. We respond to this with broader and deeper collaboration with others, and with a more dynamic approach to ensure that our technology brings the most value to our customers and our business.
We are inclusive in the pursuit, co-operative in the application and aggressive in the commoditisation of technology.
Compelling customer propositions
Our customer relationships are our greatest strength. We offer our customers a combination of advanced technology, in a complete systems solution, optimised throughout its life.
We create combinations of technology, systems and aftermarket performance that make our customers more competitive.
Long-term value creation
Our activities are complex and global. We share best practice across the Group and assess where and how activities can offer the best value.
We use the Operating System to generate greater value.

Our Research
Our Research
With a growing portfolio of products and an increasingly comprehensive range of services, our investment in Research and Technology is a key focus.
Vision
Two-thirds of our investment is aimed at improving the environmental performance of our products, for example investing in low-carbon technologies like nuclear energy.
key element in our approach to technology acquisition is our three-phase Vision Programme. Developing the right technologies means looking far into the future and generating a vision of what the needs of our customers will be. Technology acquisition is therefore planned over three time horizons:
Vision 5 - applying technology
Vision 5 describes the technologies that we currently have available 'off-the-shelf'. They will be incorporated into new products, such as the aero Trent gas turbine, while some existing engines will be modified to incorporate these proven technologies. Vision5 will ensure that current products remain market leaders in every aspect of performance, reliability and cost.
Vision 10 - the next generation
Vision 10 embodies technologies currently at the validation stage which are due to be commercially available in the medium-term to up to ten years from now. The next generation of our market-leading products will rely largely on Vision10 technologies.
Vision 20 - exploring new ideas
Vision 20 technologies target future generations of products in a 20-year timeframe. These are at the strategic research stage – emerging or as yet unproven – but will ensure that we are prepared for future market developments by focusing our extensive research base (including universities and institutions) on the technology requirements of future generations of products.
Advanced Manufacturing Research Centres
The Axnetwork is comprised of seven Advanced Manufacturing Research Centres helping us and other industrial partners achieve Best in Class capability across our portfolio of manufacturing technologies.
Research and University Technology Centres
We have an established global network of research centres. Each centre addresses a key technology; and collectively they tackle a wide range of engineering disciplines.

International Limited
+33 1 4722 1440
Overview
We’re present in the fields of aerospace, marine and power systems for various applications in Algeria.
Skills, training and community investment
Students at the Aerospace Institute of Blida (Institut d'Aéronautique de Blida) are invited to participate in the annual Student Awards, an initiative created by (as members of the Association of United States and European Aerospace Industry Representatives) to promote stronger ties between industry stakeholders and future talent. The competition invites students to submit papers on set topics in order to win prizes such as shadowing opportunities with industry stakeholders.
Civil Aerospace
Our relationship with Air Algérie began with the supply of Dart engines on Fokker 27 aircraft and the airline now operates the civil version of the C130, the L100 cargo aircraft, which is propelled by engines (T56/501D). In 2016, we signed a memorandum of understanding alongside Air Algérie paving the way for broader cooperation on the maintenance of T56/501engines
Defence Aerospace
As a partner of the Algerian Ministry of Defence, we equip numerous aircraft and helicopters in the Algerian Air Force and Algerian Navy, which operate respectively a fleet of C130 Lockheed Martin (T56 engines) and AgustaWestland Super Lynx MK130 helicopters propelled by the CTS800, a turbine produced by our joint-venture with Honeywell (Light Helicopter Turbine Engine Company).
We also equip various aircraft in the Algerian government fleet known as (Groupe de liaisons aériennes ministériel), including the Airbus A340 (Trent 500 engines), Gulfstream G-(Tay engines) and Gulfsteam G-(BR710 engines).
Marine
Since 2012, the Algerian Navy has operated designed sea-going tugs fitted with various equipment including engines, propellers and automation and control systems.
Power Systems
Our business supports a local network of service partners to provide engine maintenance. Our diesel engines equip the fleet of the Algerian Navy, notably the C28Corvettes (made by China State Shipbuilding Corporation) and the frigates (multi-purpose frigates made by ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems) which have been in service since 2016. In addition to this, Algerian state-owned companies Sonelgaz (National Society for Electricity and Gas) and Sonatrach (National Company for Research, Production, Transport, Transformation, and Commercialisation of Hydrocarbons) both use diesel generators.

pioneers cutting-edge technologies that deliver the cleanest, safest and most competitive solutions to meet our planet’s vital power needs
We are one of the world’s leading industrial technology companies.
Throughout our history, we have set out to achieve extraordinary goals. Along the way, we have developed ground-breaking technologies, established new standards and shaped the world we live in. This quest has taken us from our founding expertise in internal combustion engines to providing the world’s most powerful and efficient aero-engines.

We are one of the world’s leading industrial technology companies.
Throughout our history, we have set out to achieve extraordinary goals. Along the way, we have developed ground-breaking technologies, established new standards and shaped the world we live in. This quest has taken us from our founding expertise in internal combustion engines to providing the world’s most powerful and efficient aero-engines.
We have always pursued ever cleaner, safer and more competitive power. Now, the size and impact of the markets we serve make this task more urgent than ever. The transition to a low carbon global economy is spurring us to develop new technologies and capabilities. Today, we are combining distinct engineering disciplines to produce state-of-the-art electromechanical and hybrid power systems. The growth of electrification will form a new chapter in our history.
At the same time, the rapid pace of digitalisation offers substantial and wide-ranging opportunities. Over twenty years ago, we were the first to use sensors to collect live, commercial
data to allow real-time engine health monitoring. Today, we aim to be Digital First in everything we do.
We are committed to an environment where all our employees are able to give their best. Our success has been a result of the commitment, skills and ingenuity of our employees and their determination to be Trusted to Deliver Excellence. Electrification and digitalisation will require new talents and behaviours.
We can only prosper with the support of our key stakeholders. We strive to outperform their expectations of us.
We believe in the positive, transforming potential of technology.
We are – pioneering the power that matters.
Context for our vision
As pioneers, we must continuously innovate to provide the best solutions in the markets we serve. This requires us to anticipate the opportunities and challenges that our
customers will face. In the coming years, we believe that three key trends will define the world’s future power needs.
Context for our vision
As pioneers, we must continuously innovate to provide the best solutions in the markets we serve. This requires us to anticipate the opportunities and challenges that our
customers will face. In the coming years, we believe that three key trends will define the world’s future power needs.
The first trend is 
growing demand for cleaner, safer and more competitive power
. Global economic growth and rising prosperity will lead to increased demand for travel, trade and energy. To provide superior power for our customers, we will continuously develop and apply cutting-edge technologies.
The second trend is 
electrification
. As we move to a low carbon global economy, our engines will become part of broader, hybrid systems with lower emissions. To provide solutions for our customers, we will act as a system integrator, combining our traditional mechanical technology with electrical technology.
The third trend is 
digitalisation
. Advances in sensors, communication, data storage, processing power, machine learning, artificial intelligence, robotics and additive layer manufacturing are all combining to create new insights, new processes and new opportunities. To provide lifelong performance for our customers, we will use the huge potential of digitalisation to transform our activities.
These trends will provide opportunities for new entrants to compete in our markets. As pioneers, we must be the disruptors, challenging conventional approaches and championing new solutions.
