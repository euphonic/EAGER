Orbotech is a leading provider of process innovation technologies, solutions and equipment serving the global electronics manufacturing industry.
Orbotech has over 30 years of proven experience in product development and project delivery, providing highly-accurate, performance-driven yield enhancement and production solutions for manufacturers of printed circuit boards, flat panel displays, advanced packaging, micro-electro-mechanical systems and other electronic components.
As the demand of leading designers for devices to be smaller, thinner, wearable and flexible continues to grow, the electronics industry needs to translate this evolving language into the production of smarter devices by supporting miniaturized electronics packages, new form factors and different substrates.
As masters of The Language of Electronics, Orbotech builds bridges between designer demands and their realization on the electronics manufacturing floor. Our cutting-edge innovations include technologies and automated systems for electronics reading (inspection, verification and testing), electronics writing (inkjet, direct Imaging and repair) and electronics connecting (laser drilling, metal deposition and etch).
field-proven, enabling partner, Orbotech is poised to drive the supply chain confidently into the future.
Mission
Make smart, digital production a reality through continuous technology innovation for a better tomorrow.
Vision
Be the global leader in advanced micro manufacturing solutions for electronics and adjacent markets that ensure greater production efficiencies for sustainable profitability.

Our brand story
The language of electronics
Today’s electronic devices are a lifestyle celebration. Small, sleek – and even wearable – they impact the way we read, write and connect with one another, enriching the language of communication.
Enabling their realization is where Orbotech comes in. For over 30 years, our automated digital production systems and innovative technologies have launched a thousand designer dreams into the market. Virtually no notebook, smartphone or tablet would have made it into your hands without us.
From reading circuit boards and flat panel displays to verify their quality and initiate repair, through writing metalized circuits on multiple surfaces and connecting with better radio frequency and power semiconductor devices, Orbotech is fully fluent in the Language of Electronics – and helping to write its future.
“Orbotech has chosen ‘The Language of Electronics’ concept as its new tagline to spearhead the Company’s current rebranding effort, reflecting the highly proactive research and development and various commercial growth strategies it is pursuing. The Language of Electronics encompasses much of Orbotech’s current offering and gives us a lot of wingspan for diversification. By saying that we are masters in this richly complex language, we are declaring that Orbotech is a significant enabler in many aspects of realizing designer dreams on the electronics manufacturing floor.”
- Asher Levy, CEO, Orbotech Ltd
