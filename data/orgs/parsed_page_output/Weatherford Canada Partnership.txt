Committee Compositions
The Board directs and oversees the management of the business and affairs of the Company, and serves as the ultimate decision-making body of the Company, except for those matters reserved to our shareholders. The Board oversees the management team, to whom it has delegated responsibility for the Companyâs day-to-day operations. 
While the Boardâs oversight role is very broad and may concentrate on different areas from time to time, its primary areas of focus are strategy, governance and compliance, as well as assessing management and making changes as circumstances warrant. In many of these areas, significant responsibilities are delegated to the Boardâs Committees, which in turn are responsible for reporting to the Board on their activities and actions. Our Board has established the following committees: Audit; Compensation; Corporate Governance and Nominating; and Health, Safety and Environment. The committee assignments for each Director are detailed below.
Audit
Compensation
William Macaulay is the Independent Chairman of the Board.
