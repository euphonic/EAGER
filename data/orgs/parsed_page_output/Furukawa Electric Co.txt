R&Vision
The Group will mobilize the Group's abilities and contribute to society with its material technology based around the theme of "using technology acquired through our material capabilities to help realize a society that is comfortable for living."
Cultivating New, Next-generation business (highly profitable business)
formulated its "long term Vision" for research and development, focusing on the theme of "using technology acquired through our material capabilities to help realize a society that is comfortable for living."
Based on this vision, we have developed our pillars as: "Create green-energy cars", "Create a smart power infrastructure" and "Build high-capacity telecommunication infrastructure". These are areas of emphasis for Cultivating New, Next-generation business.
In "Create green-energy cars", in response to the growing demand for lighter weight we have developed thinner-diameter harnesses, aluminum harnesses and forming material for bodies by applying polymer technology. As batteries will become increasingly important components, we also developed battery level sensors to measure the amount of charge.
In "Create a smart power infrastructure", we will advance development of technology that can store power from photovoltaic and wind power generation, and power network technology that links smart meters, as well as development of superconductivity.
In "Build high-capacity telecommunication infrastructure", where speed is transitioning from 100 Gbps to 400 Gbps, we are developing new types of optical fibers, varieties of active and passive optical components, and optical interconnection that can undertake large-capacity communication within servers.
Cultivating New, Next-generation business
Integrating Group Capabilities and Promoting Open Innovation
To develop these new materials and new technologies, it will become more necessary than ever to integrate the entire Group's capabilities. Our R&division, to activate our development capabilities, will concentrate and integrate various technologies now scattered among different departments and subsidiaries and affiliates.
By using our research laboratories in the United States and European Union as a foothold, we will promote the internationalization of our research and development projects. In addition to such activities, we will aggressively promote Open Innovation by cooperation not only with universities and public research institutes, but also with industrial companies.

Co., Ltd.Basic Views on Corporate Governance
Based on the "Group Corporate Philosophy" , we enhance our management performance responding appropriately to changes in the business and market environment by prompt business decision making as well as with transparency and fairness. At the same time, we ensure sound management by developing and establishing an effective internal control system. With these, we will expand and develop our business on a sustainable basis and increase our corporate value. Furthermore, we seek to strengthen and enhance our corporate governance, in accordance with the followings:
We secure the rights and equal treatment of shareholders;
We consider interests of stakeholders including shareholders, and cooperate appropriately with them;
We ensure appropriate information disclosure and transparency;
Given its fiduciary responsibility and accountability to shareholders, the board of directors carries out effective oversight of management from objective standpoint, respecting the independent directors' role for the oversight;
We engage in constructive dialogue with shareholders who have investment policies in accordance with interests of mid- to long-term shareholders.
Guidelines on Corporate Governance
Based on "Basic Views on Corporate Governance", we adopted "Guidelines on Corporate Governance" as a policy for enhancing our corporate governance.
We adopt the "Audit and Supervisory Board" type of governance organization under the Japanese Companies Act taking account of the importance of maintaining the independence of the statutory audit function. And we have a "Nominating/Compensation Committee", majority members of which are outside directors to complement oversight function of the board.
Corporate Governance Organization Chart
Oversight and Supervising
Board of Directors
Given its fiduciary responsibility and accountability to shareholders, the board is responsible for promoting sustainable corporate growth and the increase of corporate value over the mid- to long-term and enhancing earnings capability and capital efficiency. The board oversights and determines the matters listed below:
Determination of corporate governance-related matters;
Establishment and amendment of business strategies and oversight of execution of such strategies and plans by management;
Setting capital allocation policy;
Appointment and dismissal of executives including representative director and corporate vice president, and determination of the remuneration of them (including delegating these to Nominating/Compensation Committee);
Establishment of an internal control system relating to compliance and financial reporting and risk management systems, and oversight of them;
Decision on important business matters;
Others prescribed by the applicable laws and regulations etc.
At present, the board consists of 12 directors with 5 outside directors including 3 independent directors in order to enhance transparency in decision-making and strengthen its oversight functions over the management taking outside directors' advice and opinion.
Outside directors have rich management experiences in financial institutions, trading companies or manufacturing companies, and expertise in the field of legal or industrial governmental policy etc., in addition to the knowledge of our business area. The board respects their views and opinions based on their variety of experiences in making its decision.
We established the Nominating/Compensation Committee, replacing the former Compensation Committee in May 2015.
The committee's aim is to enhance our corporate governance securing the objectivity and transparency as to nominating and compensation for directors etc. The committee consists of 5 or more members, majority of which shall be outside directors, appointed from directors by board resolution.
At present, the committee consists of 6 members (4 outside directors).
Audit & Supervisory Board
Audit & Supervisory Board and each its member auditor collect information about management under statutory investigation authority and report and express their views to the board meetings and the management from an independent and objective standpoint as a fiduciary to shareholders.
Auditors ensure coordination with internal audit department through regular meetings, and report the policy, plan and result of auditing to the board regularly.
Full-time auditors attend the meetings such as Management Committee which decides major business matters, and they report information obtained from these audit activities to the non-Full-time and outside auditors.
We strengthen our audit function by appointing an assistant staff to the auditors who is dependent of management.
At present, the Audit & Supervisory Board consists of 6 members (3 members are outside and independent).
Business Operation
President is responsible for management of our whole business operation as a chief executive under the board’s oversight.
Our business consists of 14 business divisions, and General Managers of each division are responsible for leading each business operation including subsidiaries and affiliated companies management.
We also appoint General Managers of Communications Solutions Division, Energy Infrastructure Division and Electronics & Automotive Systems Division in order to supervise closely related business divisions. Furthermore, we appoint Advisors of Functional Component Business in order to assist President’s supervising function over each business operations and to plan integrated business strategy for each business sector.
In addition, we appoint General Manager of Global Marketing Sales Division that are responsible for our group’s sales and marketing entirely, and General Managers of Corporate Divisions that are responsible for planning group strategy and assisting operation.
These officers are members of the Management Committee, which is the highest decision-making body of business operation.
Management Committee, held 3 times a month basically, deliberates and determines major operational matters. Further, their business affairs and operation are quarterly reported to the Committee to foster common understanding of company business among them and integrated business operation as a whole.
These business affairs and operation are also quarterly reported to the board.
establishes, develops and operates its internal control for the purpose of efficient execution of responsibilities, compliance, risk management, information management and group company management.Basic Approach
Group regards compliance as "not only observing laws and regulations, but also as acting in accordance with the values and ethics required of the company and its employees as responsible members of society". Each and every employee is encouraged to perform day-to-day compliance activities in line with our three musts for compliance activities: to "be aware", "speak" and "rectify".
1. Be aware
Is this in line with the philosophy and Code of Conduct?
Is this an improper practice?
Does this run counter to society's requirements and expectations?
2．Speak
3. Rectify
As soon as you become aware of it, fix it.
Always improve.
Training and Raising Awareness among Employees
We conduct a host of training and awareness activities in the aim of instilling compliance awareness among all employees. Our primary shared educational materials are the Group Code of Conduct and its corresponding Group Compliance Handbook. We distribute this handbook to Group employees and take many opportunities to make use of it. We conduct compliance education for employees at every level of the Company, from new recruits to directors. At the same time, we hold theme-based group training and e-learning courses, and conduct groupwide compliance education.
Initiatives in Compliance Months
Group has designated October and November as Compliance Months, during which we implement measures aimed at tackling the variety of compliance issues faced by companies across our Group.
Employee Compliance Awareness Surveys
We have biannually continued to implement compliance awareness surveys at and affiliates in Japan. Designed to gauge employee awareness and understanding of compliance, these surveys aim to encourage recognition of compliance. Feedback is given on the results of the survey to our Group companies and divisions, and the results are used to make proposals for compliance measures at each organization. In fiscal 2018, we conducted compliance awareness survey from a view point of understanding of Code of Conduct.
Internal Reporting System
Group has introduced an internal reporting system to earlier detect and correct illegal acts. The Company has in place an internal reporting desk as well as an external reporting desk that makes use of outside third-party institutions (the Group Hotline), both of which allow employees to make reports anonymously. An internal reporting secretariat manages the content of such reports stringently, taking ample care to prevent people making such reports from suffering any negative impacts, looking into issues swiftly and taking appropriate action. In fiscal 2016, we newly set up external reporting desks for oversea affiliates. By the end of fiscal 2017, we have set them up in 10 countries and 40 affiliates.
Security Trade Control
Group considers security trade control to be one of its most important responsibilities as a company with global business operations. In accordance with the laws and regulations that make up the international framework on security trade control (the export control regime), we have improved and strengthened our management systems for cargoes and technologies that can be converted to weapons or military uses. In exporting products and providing technology, we conduct transaction screenings based on our Security Trade Control Regulations to ensure compliance with relevant legislation and are careful to prevent circumvent to countries of concern.
Group formulated the Group Anti-Bribery Statement in April 2012. In December, we published the Group Anti-Bribery Guide, and we are promoting activities toward creating a groupwide bribery risk management system.
