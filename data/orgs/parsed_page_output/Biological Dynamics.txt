Treatment Response (RUO)
molecular diagnostics oncology pipeline is looking at treatment response monitoring with OncoState™ Lung assay. The assay is intended to assist clinicians in evaluating whether a patient undergoing cancer therapy is responding to the treatment. The test only requires a 250µblood sample and the results are available in 40 minutes with minimal hands-on time.
Measuring cfin plasma of patients undergoing anti-cancer treatment with checkpoint inhibitors, targeted treatments, chemotherapies, and combination regimens.
working prototype of the OmniVerita™ system.
OmniVerita™ system (RUO) is is the first clinical application of the Verita™ platform that is currently being developed by Dynamics. 
This system consists of a disposable microfluidic cartridge, a fully automated benchtop analyzer (OmniVerita™,  pictured on the left),  and a growing portfolio of treatment response monitoring OncoState™ assays.
The system uses a small sample size (< 0.2 mL) and the results are available in less than 1 hour. Each cartridge incorporates 8 independent arrays and can accommodate up to eight samples per run. The analyzer applies thermal, fluidic, optical, and electrical effects, as well as software to isolate, detect and quantify cfDNA.
OncoState™ assay
