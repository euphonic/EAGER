We develop commercial biobased processes to make widely-used chemicals that enable better, more sustainable everyday products . That enables our partners and leading brands to offer better food packaging, auto parts, clothing, tires, carpets, and more.
We’ve commercialized processes for bio-(for plastics) and for biobased butylene glycol (for cosmetics); and our technology drives the world’s first commercial-scale biobased plant for a major intermediate chemical. We’re working on polyamide intermediates (nylon) and on butadiene (tires); and we’re helping numerous companies with their bioprocesses. We have more on the way.
Our technology leadership begins with our foundation in computation and modeling, and combines bioprocess and microorganism design with production economics and technology transfer in a total solutions approach. Our ability to “program biology” keeps getting better, and includes an alliance with Ginkgo Bioworks that leverages their automated foundries to accelerate construction of our strain designs. Our intellectual property includes over 800 patents and applications. We have earned widespread acclaim for our achievements.
