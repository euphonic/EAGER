Gulf of Mexico Deepwater
Seismic processing and our Houston supercomputer identified an additional 1 billion barrels of oil accessible from our Gulf of Mexico hubs.
Whiting Refinery
Our waste heat recovery project generates steam from exhaust gas, recycling it into energy to run the refinery.  
Cherry Point Refinery
In 2018, this refinery launched a renewable diesel unit to co-process biomass alongside conventional feedstocks, producing ultra-low-sulfur diesel. 
Energy
S2000, Energy has slashed total greenhouse gas emissions by more than 2 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent.

Meet the men and women who continuously improve safety across BP’s operations.
McZEAL
From engineers to team leads to field techs, we’re always passing knowledge down the line. We share a common meeting table where we openly discuss the details of our daily events. These discussions allow us to see various ways to safely approach work scenarios. More than any job I’ve had in this industry, feel incredibly safe knowing there’s always someone to go to for an answer, no matter the question. I’m proud to work for such a goal-driven company that’s as committed to safety as BP.
CHIRAYIL
Safety at BP’s wind farms starts with observation. My team’s job is to be deeply aware of what’s happening in our surroundings. My team may not be climbing turbines, but we still have an intense obligation to foster BP’s safety culture. We want each employee to get home safe. Back to their families. Back to their lives. We want everyone to feel protected, because they are. It’s an attitude that affects you even if you’re not turning the crank.
LAMBERT
As an engineer, look at ways to build efficient systems. At BP, “efficient” always means “safe” first. I’m encouraged to look beyond the system to consider our colleagues who will actually carry out the job and think about the impact of the work on them. The workers are key to any system’s efficiency — so their safety needs to be paramount. am not going to ask them to do anything would not be willing to do myself. If it isn’t safe enough for me, it’s not efficient for anyone.
DAVIES
An outsider to the industry may expect the emphasis on safety to be made along the front lines offshore. As a drilling engineer, support rig site personnel from behind the scenes to deliver a safe and compliant operation. Even though only visit the rigs a few times a year, I’m just as focused on safe operations as those on the platform.

The world is growing like never before, creating opportunity for billions of people. And all this growth requires energy. But as the world demands more energy it also demands that it be produced and delivered in new ways, with fewer emissions.

At BP, we embrace this dual challenge. We have always looked to the future, adapted to change and met challenges like this head on.

Making every type of energy cleaner and better
To deliver significantly lower emissions, we need to look at everything we do. race to renewables will not be enough. That’s why we are making bold changes across our entire business.
Here’s how we are doing it: by reducing, improving, creating. We’re reducing emissions in our own operations; we’re improving our products to help customers lower their emissions; and we’re creating low carbon businesses.
&amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;gt;Your browser does not support iframes.&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt;
Using natural gas to help power Natural gas is the fastest-growing hydrocarbon fuel and is going to be more important than ever as part of the energy mix. It’s an important back-up for wind and solar intermittency, and it burns 50% cleaner than coal in power generation.
Gas is a good thing when it is produced, distributed and consumed without reaching the atmosphere first. However, methane – the main component of natural gas – is 
understood to have a higher global warming potential than CO
2
 if it finds its way into the atmosphere before it’s burned.
Which is why we’re using innovative technologies to capture and reduce methane – like solar-powered pumps, infrared cameras and inspection drones. And why we’ve set a stringent and immediate 0.2% methane intensity target, which is 
supported by the Environmental Defense Fund
