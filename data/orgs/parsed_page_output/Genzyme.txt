OKAs the specialty care global business unit of Sanofi, we are focused on rare diseases, multiple sclerosis, immunology, and oncology. More than 30 years since we began, we remain just as committed to and passionate about advancing therapies that offer hope to patients and families.
Our approach is shaped by a long history of developing highly specialized treatments and forging close relationships with physician and patient communities. Founded as in Boston in 1981, we rapidly grew to become one of the world’s leading biotechnology companies, recognized for our pioneering development of treatments for rare genetic disorders and our innovative contributions to medical science and biomanufacturing.
became part of Sanofi in 2011. While continuing to focus on rare diseases, we also established ourselves as a leader in the field of multiple sclerosis. In 2016, our focus expanded to include Sanofi’s programs in oncology and immunology.
Spirit of Hope - History of 1981-2012
As a pioneer of the biotechnology movement in the early 1980s, has always been driven by cutting-edge science and a commitment to developing treatments for unmet medical needs. In this video, former David Meeker, former Henri Termeer, and patients share how has continued to build on this foundation over the past three decades.
Our ambition is to be the industry leader in specialty care. We currently provide more than 20 treatments to patients globally, with many potential new therapies being studied in clinical trials and in Sanofi laboratories.
Driven by our commitment to patients, we strive to develop strong relationships with our patient communities, listening to their perspectives so that we can truly understand their needs. These collaborations continue to guide and motivate us as we work to push the boundaries of medicine and technology to develop new and better therapies where none existed before.

The theme for this year’s World Day, “Bringing Us Closer,” focuses on how advances in multiple sclerosis research are getting us closer to helping those affected by and connecting researchers with the broader community.
Q: Can you tell us about your role at Sanofi?
have been with the company for twelve years, originally joining in 2006 prior to its 2011 acquisition by Sanofi. Since then have had various roles, always involved in science. Currently, am laboratory head of neuroimmunology immunomodulation. In this role, manage a team of seven people working to develop immunomodulatory therapies, treatments that modify the immune response or the functioning of the immune system, for people living with multiple sclerosis (MS).
Q:  What are your current projects?
Among our most advanced projects are two potential new disease modifying therapies for MS, each of which is very unique. One is an oral treatment that was designed to access the brain and spinal cord by crossing the blood-brain barrier and impact immune cell and brain cell signaling. This may help treat MS, and potentially other diseases of the central nervous system.
The other is a potential antibody therapy for Antibodies are proteins made by the immune system that bind to specific markers on cells or tissues. This particular antibody is intended to block the interaction between two specific proteins; that interaction is a central regulator of multiple disease-causing mechanisms in MS.
also lead a project team focused on better understanding the mechanism of action of one of our marketed treatments, with the goal of potentially developing future therapies that are similarly effective, and have an improved safety profile.
Q: What do you find most compelling about research?
We know much more about now than a decade ago and a lot is being learned each day through the successes and failures of current treatments.  We are lucky to work in a time when we have the ability to understand the molecular changes brought on by therapies, and make connections between those changes, real-world patient outcomes, and the genetic profiles of patients. These are exciting times for research that are paving the way for personalized medicine in MS.
Q: What inspires your work?
So many people are touched by For me, I’m personally connected by my cousin who was recently diagnosed. It feels good to work for a company that is driven by patients and science. work with passionate and hard-working scientists who are motivated to make a difference.
I’m inspired knowing that commit each day to a great cause and that some of what am working on today has the potential to make a difference in someone’s life. I’m motivated knowing that our work here could make a difference so that, years from now, a patient may be able to stand up and cheer at their grandchild’s graduation. I’m inspired thinking that our work could make a difference to those who want to remain active, productive and successful members of society.

Finally, at the age of twelve, after several visits to various physicians, Paula was diagnosed with Mucopolysaccharidosis (I), an inherited genetic disorder caused by a deficiency in an enzyme called alpha-L-iduronidase. Globally, occurs in about 1 in every 100,000 births.
While the news was hard for Paula and her family to accept, they were also relieved to finally have a concrete reason for years of unexplained symptoms. confirmed diagnosis meant Paula was able to begin treatment for the symptoms that had afflicted her since childhood.
Five years after her diagnosis, Paula was accepted to our Humanitarian program. The primary goal of the program is to deliver enzyme replacement therapy, to the best of our ability, to patients with lysosomal storage disorders (LSDs) who have a demonstrated need in certain circumstances where treatment access is limited.
With more than 30 patients enrolled at any given time, Brazil is one of the largest countries in our humanitarian program. In Brazil the program is primarily used as a bridge to reimbursement.
Now 28 years old, Paula has graduated from university with a degree in psychology.
