Our People Deal
People matter most at Cisco. We grow our strengths, champion bold ideas, and bring meaning to our work every day.
Leadership is an attitude, not a title. Our leaders roll up their sleeves and motivate us to do the same.
Inclusivity is our strength and our priority. We want every employee to feel valued, respected, and heard. We thrive on diverse thinking, ideas, and practices in everything we do.
We give our time, hands, and hearts to transform education, boost access to technology, and preserve the planet.
