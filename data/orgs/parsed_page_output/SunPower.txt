window.$ = jQueryhas been developing record-breaking solar technology since the 1970s. Our history over these decades has been marked by creativity, craftsmanship – and confidence.
1970s
Our record of solar innovation began nearly four decades ago, when our co-founder, Dr. Richard Swanson, was pondering ways to deal with the oil crisis. At that time, solar cells were being used on satellites, a concept he found intriguing. His engineering challenge was to figure out how to make the cells more cost-effective. So he began a quest that, almost 40 years later, has helped position as a leader in residential, commercial and utility-scale solar power production.
1980s
By 1985, Dr. Swanson (who by then was a professor of electrical engineering at Stanford) had been awarded grants from the Electric Power Research Institute and the Department of Energy to support his solar power explorations. With the help of these funds – as well as financial support from two venture capital firms – was officially incorporated in April 1985.
1990s
In the 1990s, received initial funding from Associate Venture Investors and Technology Funding and an R&contract from and solar technology was used to power some of the most innovative applications for solar power race cars and airplanes.

It's true that all solar produces clean energy, but doesn't stop there. We raise the bar for environmental and social sustainability through our "Beneficial by Design" philosophy that aims to be a regenerative force on the environment and society. From our E-Series and X-Series Direct Current (DC) panels that have achieved Cradle to Cradle Certified™ Silver recognition, to our Light on Land® program, we are proud to lead the industry in environmental stewardship.
Our "Beneficial by Design" Philosophy
has a closed-loop sustainability strategy that drives our business practices at every stage of our product lifecycle and beyond, extending to our employees and communities around the world.
is the world’s first solar company to earn the prestigious Cradle to Cradle CertifiedSilver designation for our E-Series and X-Series direct current (DC) panels manufactured in our facilities in Mexico, France and the Philippines for our environmental stewardship and sustainable manufacturing practices within the facilities.
Building solar and regenerating land
SunPower's Light on Land® program was created for our solar power plant development projects where we build on disturbed lands, restore native habitats, minimize disruptions, and act as good neighbors to the surrounding communities.
Going Landfill Free
Our facilities in Mexico and France have earned the solar industry’s first landfill-free verifications from Sustainability. Take a peek inside our landfill-free plant in Mexicali, Mexico, to see how we do it.
Organizations earn more Points
helps builders and businesses earn additional points because our E-Series and X-Series panels are Cradle to Cradle Certified™ Silver, and our packaging materials are recyclable or reusable, reducing construction waste.
Measuring our Impact
Our Product Discount Program enables universities and qualified organizations to purchase products at a significant discount for educational purposes and community-related projects.
We sponsor 3(Solar Service Station), a social business which provides rechargeable solar lanterns, training and livelihoods to underserved communities in the Philippines. Individuals not only have safe and reliable lighting, but also jobs managing the station and lantern rentals.
We partner with We Care Solar to provide science and technology education while building solar suitcases that are donated to schools, orphanages, and relief camps who need reliable electricity.
