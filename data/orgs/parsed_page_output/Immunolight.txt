Company Overview

was founded in 2007 by Frederic (Rick) Bourke, a fashion icon in the handbag business. For over 30 years Rick’s passion has been the pursuit and development of science, from his support and involvement in the human genome project, to the development of the immune modulating photopheresis technology, to his current activities with the founding and development of the technology. He has devoted most of his life and much of his wealth to science.

The catalyst behind Rick’s invention arose out of his passion for animals. In 2007 he brought his beloved dog, Lucy, to be treated at a renowned vet hospital at Cornell University. There he met another dog owner who, running out of money and options, was there seeking a last treatment resort for his ailing dog. Without hesitation, Rick paid for Riley, this stranger’s dog to be treated. Following this, Rick connected the dots between the two dog’s conditions and conceived of the idea of generating light inside a tumor to induce an immune response against cancer–akin to a related technology (photopheresis) that has been successfully used on cancers of the blood. Rick subsequently founded around this concept. He has been the sole funder of the exhaustive research undertaken to prove the concept, develop the technology and deliver it into practice.

Rick took early action to assemble a highly competent team of scientists, starting with Harold Walder, a former R&executive at J&J, and current president of Immunolight. Together, they established a relationship with Duke University and enlisted the support of a highly interdisciplinary team consisting of over 30 scientists, engineers and physicians, plus technical and administrative staff. Over time, as breakthroughs were innovated, numerous patents have been filed spanning the medical and commercial arenas that comprise a robust and extensive patent estate. As feasibility work nears completion in the adhesive curing and cancer applications, and with additional applications in earlier stages of development, we are seeking global strategic partners to assist in leveraging the breadth of this technology platform and delivering high value innovative solutions around the world.

New Psoralen Mechanism of Action Discovered That Attacks Breast Cancer Cells

Durham, – LLC, an emerging leader in the development of a breakthrough platform technology leveraging the latest advances in energy transfer, has announced research about a new mode of action utilizing psoralen, a naturally occurring compound found in broccoli and figs, that may shed new light on the fight against cancer.

For decades, psoralen has been used to treat skin disorders, cancer and autoimmune disease. The compound is inert until activated by light, after which it has been shown to interfere with the of a cell and prevent it from replicating.

DURHAM, – common compound known to fight lymphoma and skin conditions actually has a second method of action that makes it particularly deadly against certain aggressive breast tumors, researchers at Duke Medicine report.

The compound is called psoralen, a natural component found in foods such as figs and celery, and researchers have long understood that it that works by disrupting replication and causing cell death when activated by an energy source such as light.

ONE: Photo-Activated Psoralen Binds the ErbB2 Catalytic Kinase Domain, Blocking ErbB2 Signaling and Triggering Tumor Cell Apoptosis

Photo-activation of psoralen with irradiation, referred to as PUVA, is used in the treatment of proliferative skin disorders. The anti-proliferative effects of have been largely attributed to psoralen intercalation of DNA, which upon treatment, triggers the formation of interstrand crosslinks (ICL) that inhibit transcription and replication. Here, we show that exerts antitumor effects in models of human breast cancer that overexpress the ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase oncogene, through a new mechanism.

An Emerging Technology May Allow Adhesives in Opaque Substrates to be Cured by or Visible Light

Adhesives and coatings cured by ultraviolet (UV) or visible light have become valuable tools in modern-day assembly operations, particularly in high-technology industries such as electronics and medical devices. Most adhesives are based on free radical polymerization systems with acrylate or methacrylate monomers, although other systems such as cationically cured cycloaliphatic epoxies, vinyl ethers, and oxetanes are known.

Activity of Psoralen-Functionalized Nanoscintillators against Cancer Cells upon X-ray Excitation

We report development of a nanoparticle-based, X-ray-activated anticancer “nanodrug” composed of yttrium oxide (Y2O3) nanoscintillators, a fragment of the HIV-1 peptide, and psoralen. In this formulation, X-ray radiation is absorbed by the Y2O3 nanoscintillators, which then emit light. Absorption of photons by nanoparticle-tethered psoralen has the potential to cross-link adenine and thymine residues in UVA-induced cross-linking by free psoralen upon activation with light has previously been shown to cause apoptosis in vitro and an immunogenic response in vivo.
