Founders
After launching to increase clean energy access in off-grid markets, Angaza’s founders quickly realized that, despite demand for high-quality solar energy systems, the upfront product costs were prohibitively expensive for the consumers who needed them the most. To meet this existing consumer demand, developed a complete technology solution to make life-changing products accessible and affordable. Our embedded metering and monitoring technology allows device manufacturers to make their products Pay-As-You-Go enabled, and our software suite allows product distributors to digitize their data, automate their operations, and rapidly scale their last-mile distribution businesses.
