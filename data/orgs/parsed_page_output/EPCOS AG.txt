Environmental Protection / Occupational Health and Safety
Environmental Protection / Occupational Health and Safety
Economy, customer benefit and quality are key criteria of product assessment. But environmental compatibility is also coming to the fore as a quality feature. Economy and ecology do not necessarily conflict. As our customers keep miniaturizing their products with and components of diminishing dimensions and rising scales of integration, they provide a classic example of how resources can be spared while costs are cut.
The following link guides you to information on environmental protection, environmentally friendly products as well as certificates of facilities provided by on the global website: 
Environmental information of Corporation
Acknowledging its responsibility to future generations, Electronics has implemented a global environment management system that ensures the same high standards of protection worldwide. This corporate code applies to all locations. Regular audits by independent bodies monitor compliance. The aim of our environmental management system is not merely compliance with all statutory and administrative requirements, but efficient use of precious resources. We avoid hazardous substances and minimize waste. For example, all relevant components comply with the European Union's ban on lead. Another key issue is environmentally friendly disposal of waste water.

Products
The diverse range of Electronics portfolio includes capacitors, ferrites and inductors, piezo and protection devices, as well as sensors.
Electronic components and systems are found today in almost every item of electrical equipment, where they are essential for guaranteeing perfect functionality. They perform key functions in cars and trucks, industrial machine tools and in electric railways, wind farms and photovoltaic plants, as well as in washing machines, lamps, smartphones, notebooks and televisions. In all these applications Electronics solutions ensure the supply of power, protect electronic circuits and ensure their fault-free operation.
Capacitors
 are used in all fields of electrotechnology and electronics. They store electric charges and they filter currents and voltages. The portfolio includes aluminum electrolytic, aluminum polymer and film capacitors, whose main applications are in power supplies and converters. Power capacitors ensure a stable supply of power in electric trains, for example. In addition, power capacitors are the key components for the transmission of high-voltage direct current, which enables energy to be transmitted over long distances with minimal loss.
Inductors
 fulfill two basic functions of electrotechnology, often simultaneously: the filtering of currents and the storage of electromagnetic energy. Ferrites, in turn, constitute the core of inductances and they bundle electromagnetic fields for the transmission of electrical signals and power. Inductors are used, among other things, in switch-mode power supplies for information and communications applications, as well as in automotive, industrial and entertainment electronics. also manufactures components that ensure electromagnetic compatibility and, consequently, the fault-free operation of all types of electronic equipment.
Piezo and protection devices
 protect electronic circuits against voltage spikes and current surges. The portfolio includes surge arresters and switching spark gaps, thermistors, varistors and a comprehensive array of multilayer components that include piezo-actuators, as well as CeraDiode® varistors, the extremely thin CeraPad
®
 substrate with integrated protection, and CeraLink™ capacitors. These components are essential, above all, in vehicles, industrial equipment and household appliances, but also in power engineering, and smartphones, tablets and wearables. Among the latest product highlights are PowerHap™ piezo actuators with haptic feedback, CeraPlas™ for the generation of cold plasma, and CeraCharge™, the world’s first rechargeable solid-state battery.
Sensors and sensor systems
 include temperature sensors, which, for example, are used in vehicles in systems for reducing emissions. Such components are also used in household appliances and industrial plants. To these must be added the pressure sensors and transmitters that are required primarily for the monitoring and diagnosis of pneumatic and hydraulic systems and for the control of valve and filter systems. One further field of application is medical technology, such as the machines for measuring blood pressure or for artificial respiration. Rounding out the portfolio of sensors is the Tronics product spectrum, which consists primarily of inertial sensors that, among other things, are able to sense acceleration and rotation.

Article IV: Time for Products; Delay
1.
Times set for Products shall only be binding if all Documents to be furnished by the Purchaser, necessary permits and approvals, especially concerning plans, are received in time and if agreed terms of payment and other obligations of the Purchaser are fulfilled. If these conditions are not fulfilled in time, times set shall be extended reasonably; this shall not apply if the Supplier is responsible for the delay.
2.
a)
Force majeure, such as mobilization, war, terror attacks, rebellion or similar events (e.g. strike or lockout),
b)
Virus attacks or other attacks on the Supplier’s systems occurring despite protective measures were in place that complied with the principles of proper care;

Hindrance attributable to German, or otherwise applicable national, or international rules of foreign trade law or other circumstances for which supplier is not responsible; or 
d)
The fact that Supplier does not receive its own products in due time or due form such times shall be extended accordingly.
3.

4.
Purchaser’s claims for damages due to delayed Products as well as claims for damages in lieu of performance exceeding the limits specified in No. 3 above are excluded in all cases of delayed Products, even upon expiry of a time set to the Supplier to effect the Products. This shall not apply in cases of liability based on intent, gross negligence, or due to loss of life, bodily injury or damage to health. Rescission of the contract by the Purchaser based on statue is limited to cases where the Supplier is responsible for the delay. The above provisions do not imply a change in the burden of proof to the detriment of the Purchaser.
5.
At the Supplier’s request, the Purchaser shall declare within a reasonable period of time whether it, due to the delayed Products, rescinds the contract or insists on the delivery of the Products.

Article V: Passing of Risk
Risk shall pass from Supplier to Purchaser in accordance with the relevant agreed INCOTERM.
Article VI: Receiving Products
The Purchaser shall not refuse to receive Products due to minor defects.
Article VII: Defects as to Quality
The Supplier shall be liable for defects as to quality (“Sachmängel”), hereinafter referred to as “Defects”, as follows:
1.
Defective parts or defective services shall be, at the Supplier’s discretion, repaired, replaced or provided again free of charge, provided that the reason for the Defect had already existed at the time when the risk passed.
2.
Claims for repair or replacement are subject to a statute of limitations of 12 months calculated from the start of the statutory statute of limitations; the same shall apply mutatis mutandis in the case of rescission and reduction. This shall not apply where longer periods are prescribed by law according to Sec. 438 para. 1 No. 2 (buildings and thing are used for building), Sec. 479 para. 1 (right of recourse), and Sec. 634a para 1 No. 2 (defects of a building) German Civil Code (“Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch”), in the case of intent, fraudulent concealment of the Defect or non-compliance with guaranteed characteristics (“Beschaffenheitsgarantie”). The legal provisions regarding suspension of the statute of limitations (“Ablaufhemmung”, “Hemmung”) and recommencement of limitation periods shall be unaffected. 
3.
Notification of Defect by the Purchaser shall be given in written form without undue delay. 
4.
In the case of notification of a Defect, the Purchaser may withhold payments to an amount that is in a reasonable proportion to the Defect. The Purchaser, however, may withhold payments only if the subject-matter of the notification withhold payments only if the subject-matter of the notification of the Defect involved is justified and incontestable. The Purchaser has no right to withhold payments to the extent that its claim of a Defect is time-barred. Unjustified notifications of Defect shall entitle the Supplier to demand reimbursement of its expenses by the Purchaser. 
5.
The Supplier shall be given the opportunity to repair or to replace the defective good (“Nacherfüllung”) within a reasonable period of time.
6.
If repair or replacement is unsuccessful, the Purchaser is entitled to rescind the contract or reduce the remuneration; any claims for damages the Purchaser may have according to No. 10 shall be unaffected.
7.
There shall be no claims based on Defect in cases of insignificant deviations from the agreed quality, of only minor impairment of usability, of natural wear and tear, or damage arising after the passing of risk from faulty or negligent handling, excessive strain, unsuitable equipment, defective civil works, inappropriate foundation soil, or claims based on particular external influences not assumed under the contract, or from non-reproducible software errors. Claims based on defects attribute to improper modifications or repair work carried out by the Purchaser or third parties and the consequences thereof are likewise excluded.
8.
The Purchaser shall have no claim with respect to expenses incurred in the course of supplementary performance, including costs of travel, transport, labor, and material, to the extent that expenses are increased because the subject-matter of the Products has subsequently been brought to another location than the Purchaser’s branch office, unless doing so complies with the normal use of the Products.
9.
The Purchaser’s right of recourse against the Supplier pursuant to Sec. 478 German Civil Code is limited to cases where the Purchaser has not concluded an agreement with its customers exceeding the scope of the statutory provisions governing claims based on Defects. Moreover, No. 8 above shall apply mutatis mutandis to the scope of the right of recourse the Purchaser has against the Supplier pursuant to Sec. 478 para. 2 German Civil Code.
10.
The Purchaser shall have no claim for damages based on Defects. This shall not apply to the extent that a Defect has been fraudulently concealed, the guaranteed characteristics are not complied with, in the case of loss of life, bodily injury or damage to health, and/or intentionally or grossly negligent breach of contract on the part of the Supplier. The above provisions do not imply a change in the burden of proof to the detriment of the Purchaser. Any other or additional claims of the Purchaser exceeding the claims provided for in this Article VIII, based on a Defect, are excluded. 
Article VIII: Industrial Property Rights and Copyrights; Defects in Title
1.
Unless otherwise agreed, the Supplier shall provide the Products free from third parties’ industrial property rights and copyrights (hereinafter referred to as “IPR”) with respect to the country of the place of delivery only. If a third party asserts a justified claim against the Purchaser based on an infringement of an by the Products made by the Supplier and used in conformity with the contract, the Supplier shall be liable to the Purchaser within the time period stipulated in Article No. 2 as follows:
a)
the Supplier shall choose whether to acquire, at its own expense, the right to use the with respect to the Products concerned or whether to modify the Products such that they no longer infringe the or replace them. If this would be impossible for the Supplier under reasonable conditions, the Purchaser may rescind the contract or reduce the remuneration pursuant to the applicable statutory provisions;
b)
The Supplier’s liability to pay damages is governed by Article XI;
c)
The above obligations of the Supplier shall apply only if the Purchaser (i) immediately notifies the Supplier of any such claim asserted by the third party in written form, (ii) does not concede the existence of an infringement and (iii) leaves any protective measures and settlement negotiations to the Supplier’s discretion. If the Purchaser  stops using the Products in order to reduce the damage or for other good reason, it shall be obliged to point out to the third party that no acknowledgement of the alleged infringement may be inferred from the fact that the use has been discontinued. 
2.
Claims of the Purchaser shall be excluded if it is responsible for the infringement of an IPR.
3.
Claims of the Purchaser are also excluded if the infringement of the is caused by specifications made by the Purchaser, by a type of use not foreseeable by the Supplier or by the Products being modified by the Purchaser or being used together with products not provided by the Supplier.
4.
In addition, with respect to claims by the Purchaser pursuant to No. 1 a) above, Article Nos. 4, 5 and 9 shall apply mutatis mutandis in the event of an infringement of an IPR.
5.
Where other defects in title occur, Article shall apply mutatis mutandis.
6.
Any other claims of the Purchaser against the Supplier or its agents or any such claims exceeding the claims provided for in this Article VIII, based on a defect in title, are excluded.
Article IX: Conditional Performance
1.
The performance of this contract is conditional upon that no hindrances attributable to German, or otherwise applicable national, or international rules of foreign trade law or any embargos or other sanctions exist. The obligation to supply Products or services shall not apply if applicable legal provisions preclude their supply including but not limited to German or other export restrictions.
2.
The obligation to supply Products or services also does not apply if and to the extent necessary approvals for the supply (including but not limited to approvals agreed with purchaser in individual contracts) have not been given and / or not been given in time by purchaser and / or if such circumstances subsequently become known to Supplier.
3.
The Purchaser shall provide any information and Documents required for export, transport and import purposes.
Article X: Impossibility of Performance; Adaption of Contract
1.
To the extent that delivery is impossible, the Purchaser is entitled to claim damages, unless the Supplier is not responsible for the impossibility. The Purchaser’s claim for damages is, however, limited to an amount of 10 % of the value of the part of the Products which, owing to the impossibility, cannot be put to the intended use. This limitation shall not apply in the case of liability based on intent, gross negligence or loss of life, bodily injury or damage to health; this does not imply a change in the burden of proof to the detriment of the Purchaser. The Purchaser’s right to rescind the contract shall be unaffected.
2.
Where events within the meaning of Article No. 2 (a) to (c) substantially change the economic importance or the contents of the Products or considerably affect the Supplier’s business, the contract shall be adapted taking into account the principles of reasonableness and good faith. To the extent this is not justifiable for economic reasons the Supplier shall have the right to rescind the contract. The same applies if required export permits are not granted or cannot be used. If the Supplier intends to exercise its right to rescind the contract, it shall notify the Purchaser thereof without undue delay after having realized the repercussions of the event; this shall also apply even where an extension of the delivery period has previously been agreed with the Purchaser.

3.
The above provision does not imply a change in the burden of proof to the detriment of the Purchaser.
Article XII: Venue and Applicable Law
1.
If the Purchaser is a businessman, sole venue for all disputes arising directly or indirectly out of the contract shall be the Supplier’s place of business. However, the Supplier may also bring an action at the Purchaser’s place of business.
2.
This contract and its interpretation shall be governed by German law to the exclusion of the United Nations Convention on contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG).
Article XIII: Severability Clause
The legal invalidity of one or more provisions of this Agreement in no way affects the validity of the remaining provisions. This shall not apply if it would be unreasonably onerous for one of the parties to be obligated to continue the contract.

RoII
Passive Components ready to be used with Products according to Article 2 of directive 2011/65/EU
The new RoDirective (Directive 2011/65/EU) went into effect on January 3, 2013, thus replacing Ro(Directive 2002/95/EC). This directive was published on July 1, 2011, under the official designation, “Directive 2011/65/of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 8, 2011, No. 174/88.”
There are a few changes for manufacturers of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) under RoThe important differences between Roand Roare in the following areas:
1. Scope
Rodefines a gradual extension of the requirements to all electrical and electronic equipment (EEE), cables and spare parts with a view to full compliance by July 22, 2019.
Roclarifies important definitions (Article 3) such as “homogeneous material.”
2. Restriction of new substances
The Commission will review the list of restricted substances by July 2014, and periodically thereafter.
3. Exemptions
Rodefines clearer and more transparent rules for granting, renewing or deleting exemptions.
4. Coherence with other legislation
Rois part of a new legislative framework. In particular, this affects marking and Declaration of Conformity (including the harmonized standard 50581).
So far no additional substance restrictions had been added compared to 2002/95/EC; even the exemptions are unchanged.
Affected categories of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE):
Large household appliances
Small household appliances
and telecommunications equipment
Consumer equipment
Lighting equipment
Electrical and electronic tools (with the exception of large-scale stationary industrial tools)
Toys, leisure and sports equipment
Medical devices (subsequently valid from July 22, 2014)
Monitoring and control instruments including industrial monitoring and control instruments (valid from July 22, 2017)
Automatic dispensers
Other not covered by any of the categories above (valid from July 22, 2019)
Like the preceding Roregulation, the RoDirective does not apply to components. Nevertheless, Electronics Group provides products – according to the Electronics Group list of products that are Rocompatible – that are ready to be used with of the categories mentioned above.
Other countries outside the European Union have either implemented regulations similar to Roor are planning to do so. In China, for example, the »Administration on the Control of Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products« (ACPEIP) went into effect on March 1, 2007.
Roinformation for products is available online in the 
Product Center
 or via 
product inquiry

Quality
No Compromise
With its Quality Management (QM) system and within the scope of its zero-defect strategy Electronics is continually improving both its processes and the control of these processes – and thus also its products and services. Customers' appreciation of this strict orientation to quality is attested by the numerous awards.
Carmakers and manufacturers of automotive electronics systems are leading the way in insisting that their suppliers operate quality systems that cover every single function and that are consistently focused on enabling these companies to reproducibly control and continually improve their processes. These demands are reflected in the international quality system standard 9001 and into the 16949 standard which, based on the former, accommodates the specific needs of the automotive industry.
As proof of the fulfillment of these standards, the Business Group and location-specific certificates are available as downloads.
