- To Our Stakeholders -
Aiming to Make an Indispensable Company for Our Customers and the World
In April 2017, we added the phrase "aspires to be an indispensable company" to Epson's Management Philosophy. This phrase declares our commitment to playing a central role in realizing a better world by continuing to leverage our original technology to create new customer value. Epson's reason for being is to enrich lives and foster greater happiness. This statement of our commitment to becoming an indispensable company also expresses our desire to use our businesses to help achieve a sustainable society-a goal that happens to overlap the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations.
joined the United Nations Global Compact in 2004. We have been contributing to solutions to social problems by implementing initiatives that are aligned with the 10 principles of the Global Compact relating to human rights, labor, environment, and anti-corruption. In 2017, we created a materiality matrix that identified and prioritized topics that we should tackle in light of their importance to both and society. We then examined the relevance of these priority topics with the 17 SDGs by comparing them against the 169 targets of the SDGs. Ultimately, we found that 13 of the SDGs intersect with Epson's current business activities. So, for the time being, we will focus more heavily on business activities that will achieve the targets under these 13 SDGs while at the same time contributing to solutions to social problems and sustainability through actions that achieve the growth strategy we have outlined in the 25 Corporate Vision.
Given the evidence of recent global climate change, initiatives that reduce the environmental impacts of enterprise are both critical and urgent for a sustainable future. has a unique portfolio of efficient, compact and precision technologies that enable us produce products that reduce the environmental footprints of our customers. These are the technologies that enabled products like the PaperLab, a dry-process office papermaking system that produces new paper from used, and our high-speed linehead inkjet multifunction printers, which combine print performance and energy efficiency. We use these technologies to maximize the environmental performance of the products and services we create, produce, and sell for use in homes, offices, and the commercial and industrial sectors. We will contribute to progress toward achieving the SDGs in ways that only can, by fully recognizing environmental and social issues throughout the value chain and by eliminating wasteful energy use.
Going forward, we will persist in our aspirations to become an indispensable company that plays a central role in realizing a better world. Toward this end, we will continue to strive to create new value by advancing our technologies and driving innovation to make the world a happier and easier place to live for all. We will look hard at solutions to social issues, understand what customers and society expect from us, and provide products and services that far exceed those expectations.

Since it was founded more than 70 years ago has continued to produce innovative products and services based on its efficient, compact and precision technologies. As embodied by our "Exceed Your Vision" corporate tagline, we have focused our corporate ethos of creativity and challenge on exceeding the expectations of our customers around the world with the ultimate aim of becoming an indispensable company for both our customers and for society in general.
In fiscal 2016 we began implementing the 25 Corporate Vision, which charts Epson's course and describes where we would like to be in ten years. Under this vision, we aim to build on the foundations we have made over the years as we look to create a new connected age of people, things and information with our efficient, compact and precision technologies.
Advances in information and communications technology mean increasing amounts of information will become available on the internet, and so-called cyber space will continue to expand. believes that products acting as the interface between cyber space and the actual or real world where businesses operate and people live will be of critical importance. As a company that specializes in generating value in the real world, will take these macro trends on board and will leverage its core technologies to generate unique value in products and services based on its efficient, compact and precision technologies. By doing this, aims to help free people from repetitive manual work and from unnecessary wastes of money, effort and time, to dramatically reduce customers' environmental impact and improve their work processes, and to significantly improve customer performance in the form of productivity, accuracy and customer creativity.
By generating value with its technologies, aims to bring positive change to the world through innovations in four areas. We will achieve inkjet innovation by providing inkjet printers with high environmental performance to the office and industry together with an in-office paper recycler that uses a dry process, and will achieve visual innovation by revolutionizing visual communications. We will seek to achieve wearables innovation with products that provide wearers with enjoyment and a sense of status, and robotics innovation with robots that support people in a wide variety of situations. By achieving these goals, we will help free people from repetitive manual work and from unnecessary wastes of time and energy, heighten people's creativity, and create a sustainable and affluent society in which people enjoy safe and healthy lifestyles.
has established an original vertically integrated business model as the best possible means to realizing its aspiration of constantly generating new customer value. We develop and manufacture in-house unique and competitive core devices including printheads for inkjet printers, optical engines for projectors, semiconductors and quartz crystal devices. firmly believe we are able to provide on a timely basis to customers products and services that exceed their expectations because of our deep familiarity with these core devices, our planning and design of distinctive products, and our advanced capability to manufacture finished products to a consistently high standard. This business model will be the base for achieving our four innovations.
Under 25, we will strengthen the companywide functions of human resources, technology, manufacturing, sales & support and the environment, utilize information technology, and advance our original business model as we seek to bring our vision to reality. As mentioned, our aim under the vision is to use our technologies to create a new connected age of people, things and information, and by doing this believe we can become an indispensable company to our customers and to society in general.
look forward to your ongoing support as we move forward to achieve these goals.
Minoru UsuiWant to Genuinely Contribute to Society with the World's Most Advanced Technology
Minoru Usui, President
Technological aspirations are embedded in Epson's DNA
Since its founding, has always sought to create value where none previously existed by pursuing technological innovation.
We created the world's first compact, lightweight digital printer, the world's first quartz watch, and the world's first photo-quality inkjet printer, whose successors are a cornerstone of the of today. The technology behind these products did not exist before they were developed.
Each of these products was developed from the ground up by engineers who aspired to bring certain value to the world or to create products that would benefit people's lifestyles. Over the years, this approach has become deeply embedded in Epson's DNA.
We have found that we have greater insights and a clearer overall picture of the technologies that we worked so hard to develop and advance. And this, in turn, allows us to maximize the potential of these technologies.
Vertical Integration
Creating value that exceeds customer expectations
believe that Epson's strength derives from a vertically integrated business model, wherein we personally develop, manufacture, and sell products that are based on core technologies and core devices that we ourselves have developed and manufactured.
Many manufacturers procure the core devices for their products and outsource manufacturing to other companies. has chosen a different path because we believe that if we were to buy the same parts as our competitors and produce similar products, then we would never be able to achieve our goal of creating products that exceed customer expectations.
is researching and developing technologies and products that will surprise you
The idea underpinning Epson's strategies is to generate value that exceeds the vision of our customers by using a vertically integrated business model to leverage our unique core devices, which emerged from core technologies that we have developed for many years.
For a company like Epson, whose businesses revolve around its core technologies, research and development projects are crucial, but it is also extremely important to strategically use the intellectual property that emerges from the R&process. R&has to be conducted from both a near-term and a long-term perspective. The outcomes have to support our businesses of today and our businesses 10 or 20 years down the road.
Our ongoing R&efforts will yield products and technologies that are sure to bring you positive surprises.
Becoming an Indispensable Company
Committed to changing the world
We at aim to contribute to society and become an indispensable company by continuing to exploit our powerful original technologies to create one-of-a-kind products that others cannot replicate.
With a thorough knowledge of technology and unsurpassed manufacturing capabilities, we are committed to creating products that aim to change the world for the better and genuinely contribute to peoples' lives.
Toward that end, we want to be the ultimate developer and manufacturer with world-class technology that exceeds your vision.to Contentsaria
