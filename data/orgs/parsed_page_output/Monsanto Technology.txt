More Sustainable Future
In 2008, we shifted our focus to full-spectrum sustainable farming solutions. We pledged to:
Help farmers double yields in corn, soybeans, and cotton by 2030;
Develop seeds that will reduce by one-third per unit produced the aggregate amount of key resources, such as land, water, and energy, required to grow crops by 2030;
Improve the lives of farmers, including an additional five million people in resource-poor farm families, by 2020.
key turning point in Monsanto’s history occurred in 2012, as we started acquiring companies producing digital tools and data modeling to provide even more precision-focused solutions for farmers. We established and learning centers throughout the to help the industry understand more about the planet that feeds us. We continue to institute outreach programs with the goal of improving the lives of families and communities around the world, including in our hometown of St. Louis, Missouri.
In 2016, Monsanto’s board of directors voted to approve an acquisition by Bayer CropScience AG, a key development in the refinement of our strategic focus. In 2017 and the coming years, our goal is to move agriculture forward by using less of our natural resources.

New Strategic Direction Under the Same Name
The name “Monsanto” has actually been around since 1901 when John Queeny founded a company that could produce saccharine at one-sixth the cost of sugar. He named the company after his wife, Olga Queeny.
In the 1940s, John’s son Edward Queeny saw an opportunity to enter the agriculture industry. The first agricultural product introduced by this was an insecticide called Santobane. The company soon expanded to provide fertilizer for farmers as well, though the current no longer sells this product.
As a result of the chemist John Franz’s discovery of a molecule that was developed into the product called glyphosate, in the 1970s the first Roundup® branded herbicide made its debut. In 1983, scientists succeeded in modifying a plant cell through biofor the first time, which led to field trials of the first genetically modified crops in 1987. This breakthrough laid the foundation for today’s Company, whose goal is to deliver products that help farmers grow food sustainably.

Monsanto’s commitment to safety  is central to everything we do – from the products and solutions we deliver, to the facilities where we work, and the processes we use to develop our products: 
Product safety depends on transparent research. We dedicate a team of hundreds of scientists to assess the safety of our products, and share their findings with regulatory authorities and the public.
All of our workplaces are operated under our environment, safety, and health policies. Outside the workplace, we promote safety off the job via educational events throughout the year.
Our human rights policy is guided by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. This robust policy applies to our operations as well as those of our business partners who provide manual labor for in-field trials and the production of seeds.

Environmental Sustainability
We only have one Earth to provide for our needs today and tomorrow. That’s why it’s so important to preserve and protect our natural environment while growing what’s needed to feed a growing global population.
Through data and modern agriculture techniques and technologies, we’re helping farmers use fewer natural resources out in the fields.
We’re also reducing our impact on the environment within our own operations. In our focus on environmental sustainability, we concentrate on four main, interrelated categories.
Climate Change
Climate change affects all of us. As global temperatures rise, farmers face unique and unexpected challenges. We’re working to adapt to and mitigate climate change by improving our operations and collaborating with others. Our digital tools, weed control solutions, and innovations enable farmers to produce better harvests from existing farmland while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Using Less Water
The world today faces a variety of pressures on the supply of fresh water. We’re working to protect freshwater sources and increase irrigation efficiency across our global seed production. Our commitment to using water more efficiently in our field irrigation operations, as well as on the contract farms that grow seed for our company, has the potential to save an estimated 30 to 80 billion gallons of water each year.

Maintaining Soil Health
It takes nearly 1,000 years for nature to create one inch of topsoil. New digital tools are allowing farmers to get a more complete picture of the microscopic makeup of the soil on their farms, allowing them to plan for the correct amount of inputs and conserve this limited resource in the process. Many operations are adopting not just the use of digital tools, but also techniques that leave valuable nutrients right where they belong, like no-till or conservation tillage.

Partner with External collaborations are a key to our promise of delivering innovative new products in the future. At Monsanto, we are focused on developing collaborative alliances that produce lasting benefits for our farmer customers and all involved.
Our Trait Licensing
While some of our multinational competitors have historically taken an approach of not broadly licensing their germplasm or trait inventions, has chosen a much different path. We broadly license germplasm and our trait innovations so farmers can realize the benefits from these inventions through the brands they prefer to plant on their farm.

The Great Honey Bee Venture
The brightest minds in the world of honey bees are searching for answers. The origin of this quest connects back to a problem plaguing every colony in North America. Aptly named, “Varroa destructor,” this pervasive parasite is one of the most significant contributors to the challenges facing honey bees. As beekeepers throughout the U.S., Canada, and Mexico can attest, if any hive is fortunate enough to live without the Varroa mite, they will not enjoy this freedom for long—infestation is merely hours away. Considering they pollinate nearly one-third of the global food supply, any challenge facing honey bees is shared with humanity.
The Varroa mite is the number one threat to honey bees in North America.
[unex_ce_article_callout_text layer-name="section 2 quote" callout_type="callout-text" id="content_ez5y5puxp" post_id="8441" semplice_styles_background_color="transparent" semplice_styles_background_image="" semplice_styles_background_size="auto" semplice_styles_background_position="50% 0%" semplice_styles_background_repeat="no-repeat" semplice_styles_padding_top="0px" semplice_styles_padding_bottom="0px" semplice_styles_padding_left="0" semplice_styles_padding_right="0"]
The Varroa mite is the number one threat to honey bees in North America.
[/ce_article_callout_text]
In response, leaders throughout modern agriculture, academia, and government are investing time, money, and intellect to provide relief to honey bees. This collective effort is an example of the long-standing commitment to biodiversity by farmers, scientists, and other conservationists. Through various areas of inquiry, a remarkable team of researchers are working to ensure the honey bee remains a robust part of modern agriculture and the ecosystem.
Varroa attach themselves to the outer anatomy of honey bees.

[/ce_article_image_with_caption]
Defending the Hive
In 2012, acquired Beeologics, a small company based in Israel. Our leadership saw great potential in their research; in particular, the work focused on helping beekeepers control negative pests. These ingenious researchers were using a sweet syrup and a Nobel prize winning discovery they hoped would lead to a safer method of controlling Varroa mites.
This groundbreaking research has matured to Phase 3 of our research and development pipeline. Expected to be under the umbrella of BioDirectTechnology, our researchers continue exploring how a naturally occurring process called, “Interference,” can be developed into a product that could help honey bees resist infestation.
“The appeal of this approach is the ability to target just the Varroa mite, while reducing or eliminating the use of chemical pesticides in honey bee colonies.“ —Dr. Jerry Hayes, Honey Bee Health Lead

In the larva stage, honey bees are particularly vulnerable to Varroa. This point in the honey bee’s development also provides easy access to the Varroa mite—true to the nature of parasites, whatever is ingested by the honey bee larvae is also consumed by the Varroa mite. With this in mind, Monsanto’s product in development will be added to larval food, metabolized and enter their bloodstream where  finally, any Varroa attached to the honey bee enjoys a final stolen meal.
Some honey bees enter adulthood with Varroa already attached. This causes deformity and the spread of viruses.

At present, the products used to treat a Varroa-infested hive cannot discern between a harmful mite and a helpful honey bee. We believe a more refined and targeted alternative is needed—a method that empowers beekeepers to apply fewer of these products, less often. To provide this more precise alternative, a more intimate knowledge of both honey bees and Varroa mites is required. Advanced genetic sequencing software is helping decode the of honey bees and Varroa to help create a new product that remains innocuous to honey bees, while being an effective control for Varroa mites.
Wisdom from the Academy
As what is often the case in science, universities are providing invaluable primary research. The University of Florida is building a considerable base of knowledge on the biology behind the Varroa mite challenge. In order to find a solution, you must first understand the problem itself.
Visiting honey bees from infected colonies can unintentionally spread Varroa.

Varroa Reproductive Behavior
One fascinating area of inquiry underway in The Sunshine State is researching how Varroa invade hives prior to reproducing. It is believed that understanding this process, will help illuminate how Varroa develop a resistance to acaricides—a substance often used to control the parasite.
Building the Bee Lab
The University of Florida is also in the process of fundraising for a dedicated honey bee research lab. The Honey Bee Research and Extension Laboratory will serve as the center for the university’s efforts to better understand this pollinator and share their findings with students, beekeepers, and other conservationists.

Insights from Government
The research arm of the USDA, the Agricultural Research Service (ARS), has a number of honey bee and Varroa mite related projects. Their labs have begun breeding pests for testing and exploring natural or alternative controls. Other avenues of Varroa research include investigating how factors like humidity or the presence of essential oils influence colony health. Many throughout beekeeping, modern agriculture, and the scientific community look forward to the insights borne from these projects. Government-funded research has historically lead to countless important breakthroughs.
Honey bee health and biodiversity are rightfully on the minds of many today. The challenges facing these essential pollinators are bigger than one company, organization, or institution. For this reason, is honored to join the cause of improving the wellbeing of honey bees. Our search is a true commitment. For the betterment of the hive, beekeeper, farmer, and consumer. As the honey bee thrives, so do we.
