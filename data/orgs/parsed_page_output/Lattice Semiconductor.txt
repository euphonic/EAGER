About Us
Corporate Social Responsibility
At Corporation, we are committed to a comprehensive corporate social responsibility (“CSR”) program that aligns with our core values and contributes to our success as a responsible corporate citizen. We believe our success depends on our ability to do the right thing for our customers, suppliers and employees. We strive to develop innovative solutions while minimizing the environmental impact of our operations. In addition to operating in full compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations, we draw upon internationally recognized standards to advance social and environmental responsibility throughout our supply chain. 
As one element of our program, we have adopted and support the most recent version of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (“EICC”) Code of Conduct. Our commitment to our program and the Code of Conduct extends to our supply chain partners. We require key suppliers to acknowledge and implement the principles within the Code of Conduct.
We implement our program through policies and procedures designed to promote continuous improvement and allow us to pursue conformance to these standards. We incorporate our initiatives into our Quality Assurance Manual, which contains a management system that includes ongoing training, documentation procedures, supply chain risk management, routine assessments, a corrective action process and management review. 
We believe continuous improvement to our program is essential to our success. We understand you have options when selecting business partners, and we are committed to making you happy with your decision to do business with Corporation.

Building on the ultra-low power (1 mW-1 W) focus of the sensstack, is releasing new cores, reference designs, demos and hardware development kits that provide scalable performance and power for always-on, on-device artificial intelligence (AI) applications.  
“Flexible, low-power, always-on, on-device is increasingly a requirement in edge devices that are battery operated or have thermal constraints. The new features of the sensstack are optimized to address this challenge, delivering improved accuracy, scalable performance, and ease-of-use, while still consuming only a few milliwatts of power,” said Deepak Boppana, Senior Director, Product and Segment Marketing, Semiconductor. “With these enhancements, senssolutions can now support a variety of low-power, flexible system architectures for always-on, on-device AI.” 
Examples of the architectural choices that senssolutions enable include: 
Stand-alone 
iCE40 UltraPlus
 / 
ECP5
 based always-on, integrated solutions, with latency, security, and form factor benefits.
Solutions utilizing iCE40 UltraPlus as an always-on processor that detects keyphrases or objects, and wakes-up a high performance So/ for further analytics only when required, reducing overall system power consumption.
Solutions utilizing the scalable performance/power benefits of ECP5 for neural network acceleration, along with flexibility to seamlessly interface to on-board legacy devices including sensors and low-end MCUs for system control.
Updates to the sensstack include:
Cores
 – New 
Compact Accelerator core
 for improved accuracy on iCE40 UltraPlus FPGA, and enhanced 
Accelerator core
 for improved performance on ECP5 FPGAs
Software Tools
 – Updated 
neural network compiler tool
 with improved ease-of-use and both Caffe and TensorFlow support for iCE40 UltraPlus FPGAs
Reference Designs
 – New 
human presence detection
 and 
hand gesture recognition
 reference designs and demos
Modular Hardware Platforms
 – New iCE40 UltraPlus development platforms including 
Himax HM01B0 UPduino Shield
, and 
DPControl iCEVision Board
Design Service Partners
 – New vehicle classification and package detection demos from sensDesign Services Partners
The 
senspartner eco-system
 continues to expand worldwide with new design service and partners focused on enabling smart home, smart factory, smart city, and smart car applications. “Lattice’s low power, small size FPGAs and neural network cores and tools, will significantly accelerate adoption of artificial intelligence at the edge,” said Amit Vashi, Chief Operating Officer, Softnautics, a sensDesign Services partner. “With our expertise in machine learning, we are proud to be working closely with to enable senssolution deployments as evident by our jointly developed vehicle classification demo using ECP5 FPGAs”.
