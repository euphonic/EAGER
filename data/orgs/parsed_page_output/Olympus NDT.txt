Our Compliance Code is based on three fundamental principles:
Medical decisions should be focused on the best interests of patients.
Products must be promoted in a manner consistent with the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approved uses (indications) as listed in the product labeling.
Training HCPs and others how to utilize our products and services in a safe and effective manner is important to enhance the well-being of the patients they serve.

Surface metrology, also known as surface roughness, is the study of the measurement and characterization of surface features.
Surface metrology not only connects product design with performance optimization and manufacturing yield, but it also provides insights for scientific discoveries and future engineering innovations. Multiple surface metrology technologies and techniques are available, making it difficult to choose the appropriate equipment for your specific application.
In this webinar, you will learn about the history, instrumentation, measurement parameters, calibration, and applications of surface metrology. Specifically, we’ll discuss how you can use laser scanning confocal microscopy to improve your surface metrology inspections.
