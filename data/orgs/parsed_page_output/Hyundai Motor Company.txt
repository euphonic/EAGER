Under the 3 Day Worry-Free Exchange, a customer who purchases or leases a new vehicle from a participating dealer may return the vehicle for any reason to exchange it for another new vehicle, provided that: 1) the vehicle is returned to the dealership where the vehicle was purchased or leased within three (3) days from the date of purchase/lease (with the three-day period being extended by one day if the final day of the three-day period falls when the dealership is closed); 2) the returned vehicle is in “like new” condition (e.g., the automobile has not been in an accident and is free from modifications, dents, scratches, tears, breaks, cracks, stains, etc.) as determined by the dealer; 3) the customer has driven the returned vehicle less than 300 miles from the date of purchase/lease; and 4) the returned vehicle is free from any outside lien. If the returned vehicle meets all of these requirements, the customer may exchange it for another new vehicle, subject to the mutual agreement of the customer and dealer on the terms of the new vehicle purchase or lease. Additional costs may apply to exchanges for a vehicle of greater value. See participating dealers or Hyundaiusa.com/ShopperAssurance for details.

thoughtful kind of car company.
What would happen if people who were passionate about cars took the time to think about them all over again, as though for the first time?
What if they cracked the entire industry wide open, peered more deeply into it, spread out all its parts, and questioned their every detail?
What if they set aside the rules and vowed to discover the things that really matter about a car the things that are universally and undeniably true?
What if they stood face-to-face with each and every automotive assumption out there and challenged them all with an unprecedented sense of openness and honesty? What kind of answers would they find?
At Hyundai, we ask ourselves the important questions every day. And, every day, we seek the best answers. It’s what makes us grow as a car company. It’s what makes us Hyundai.
