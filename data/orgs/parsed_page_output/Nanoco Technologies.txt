Annual General Meeting information
General Meeting InformationNanoco’s CFQD® quantum dots offer enhanced colour, energy efficiency, and seamless integration into existing production processes
displays have become the interface of choice between people and their devices, from smartphones to large screen televisions. Continuous improvement in the quality of these
displays is a key demand for companies that manufacture and supply such products.
Nanoco’s quantum dot technology is particularly attractive not only for its ability to enhance the colours of screens – allowing them to rival products – but also enabling manufacturers to use their existing infrastructure to do so.
Nanoco’s CFQD® quantum dots are cadmium-free, and free of other toxic heavy-metals, so they are ideally suited for use in all consumer electronic devices.
Research Link
However, most lighting technology offers lower
colour performance relative to incandescent light and fails to show the true colour of illuminated objects.
Nanoco’s CFQD® quantum dots offer a simple and effective solution that can both tune the colour and improve the quality of light. Since the materials are free from toxic cadmium and heavy-metals, they can readily be used in lighting and device applications.
Research Link
Nanoco’s nanomaterials have the potential to produce highly efficient, low cost and lightweight solar cells
Using Nanoco’s expertise in the synthesis of nanoparticles, a variety of novel materials have been developed that can absorb a wide spectrum of the sun’s energy.
These nanomaterials are being developed and used as printable inks, ideal for roll-to-roll manufacturing and low cost production of solar cells.
In the future, this technology will enable highly efficient, low cost and lightweight solar cells that could transform the economics of solar power.
Moreover, as with all other materials developed by Nanoco, these solar inks are free from toxic cadmium and heavy-metals.
Research Link
Nanoco’s nanomaterials offer improved in-vivo and in-vitro biological imaging of cells for advanced diagnostic applications
Nanoco’s technology is free from toxic cadmium and heavy-metal, so it can be used for in-vivo diagnostics opening up new areas of clinical and surgical opportunities.

About usYou are here:
quantum dots are differentiated from other quantum dot as they do not contain toxic heavy-metals such as cadmium, a known carcinogen. Legislation limiting the use of heavy-metals is becoming increasingly restrictive, to protect consumers and the environment.
The EU’s RoDirective, for example, restricts the use of cadmium in materials such as liquids, plastics or coatings to maximum concentrations of 0.01% (100 ppm). Similar legislation is in the pipeline in countries such as China, Korea, Japan and the US.
Nanoco’s innovative technology allows for highly efficient quantum dots to be made that are completely cadmium and heavy-metal free. This uniquely positions as one of the few manufacturers able to supply quantum dots which can be used without legislative restrictions on heavy metals content in a whole range of consumer electronics and lighting applications.
Research link
Nanoco’s core intellectual property revolves around four key areas: the company’s proprietary mass production process, CFQD® quantum dot materials, surface chemistry and applications/devices incorporating its materials.
For example, has patents surrounding the molecular seeding process for the production of high quality CFQD® quantum dots, cost effectively and on an industrial scale.
This process not only allows the company to produce on a large scale, it also offers precise control over the particle-size, enabling them to provide material to meet any defined specification.
All told, now holds ca. 300 granted patents or pending patent applications in these four key areas.
Nanoco’s team consists of highly qualified scientists,
sales, operational and administrative staff recruited from countries all around the world. In total the company has people spanning over 15 nationalities, testifying to the company’s hunger for the best and brightest.
With a Semi-Tech facility in Runcorn, UK, an office in Boston, US, and business development managers working in the USA, Japan, Korea, China and Taiwan, has an experienced team with a truly global outlook.
Nanoco’s patented ‘molecular seeding’ process allows for the production of uniform, high quality quantum dots on a large scale.
continues to expand its Semi-Tech production capacity to meet the increasing testing and sampling requirements of its customer base.
has signed global licensing deals with Dow Electronic Materials, Merck and Wah Hong to
service the display industry. These deals allows our partners to utilize its expertise in high volume manufacturing to market and sell Nanoco’s CFQD® quantum dots for display applications.

About usBoard Composition And Committees
The board consists of six directors, three of whom are non-executive and are considered by the board to be independent.  The board will be responsible for, among other things, strategy, budget, performance, approval of major capital expenditure and the framework of internal controls. The board has established an Audit Committee, Remuneration Committee and a Nomination Committee, with formally delegated duties and responsibilities.
Board committees:
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises Alison Fielding and Brendan Cummins. Alison Fielding is Chair, and she brings an exceptional breadth of relevant skills to the Board, with her background in chemistry and her extensive commercial, financial and international experience across the technology sector. 
The Audit Committee’s primary responsibilities are to review and monitor:
the annual report and accounts and preliminary and interim results and statements of the Company;
the appropriateness of accounting policies and the critical judgements and estimates;
the relevance of developments in accounting and reporting requirements;
the effectiveness of internal controls and risk management systems;
the auditor’s plan for the year-end audit;
the formal engagement terms, performance, objectivity and independence of the auditors including the extent of non-audit work undertaken by the auditors; and
the audit and non-audit fees of the auditors.
The Remuneration Committee comprises Alison Fielding, who is Chair of the Committee, and Brendan Cummins. The Committee is responsible for establishing a formal and transparent procedure for developing policy on executive remuneration and for setting the remuneration of individual directors.
Nominations Committee
The Nominations Committee comprises Christopher Richards, who is Chairman of the Committee, Alison Fielding and Brendan Cummins. Under normal circumstances, the Nominations Committee will meet not less than twice a year to assist the Board in discharging its responsibilities relating to the composition and make-up of the Board and any Committees of the Board. It is also responsible for periodically reviewing the Board’s structure and identifying potential candidates to be appointed as Directors or Committee members as the need may arise. The Nominations Committee is responsible for evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge and experience and the size, structure and composition of the Board and Committees of the Board, retirements and appointments of additional and replacement Directors and Committee members, and makes appropriate recommendations to the Board on such matters.
Internal Control
The board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Group’s system of internal controls.  Internal control systems are designed to meet the particular needs of the group, and to address the risks to which it  is exposed.  By their nature, internal control systems are designed to manage rather than eliminate risk, and can provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.  As stated, primary responsibility for monitoring the quality of internal controls has been delegated to the  Audit Committee.
