Our History
cane has been part of the agricultural landscape for more than 200 years. First introduced to South Texas' subtropical climate in the early 1800s, five major mills were in operation in the by 1913. However, in a short span of eight years, economic and political hardships
brought on by World War forced the last of the mills to close in 1921.
In the 1960s - almost 40 years after the last mill in the was shuttered -- agricultural leaders in South Texas, in cooperation with the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station in Weslaco and the Department of Agriculture, launched feasibility studies to determine whether cane production could once again be cost-efficient in South Texas. When those studies returned solid data showing that the time was indeed right to re-enter the market, the four-decade hiatus was over - and the cane industry in the was reborn.
The Valley's re-entry into the cane market was a grassroots effort aimed at keeping costs as low as possible and returning maximum profit to the growers. In 1970, a
cooperative of 100 South Texas farmers pledged both money and cropland to help build a new mill and establish sustainable crops. By 1973, the cooperative completed construction of a $28 million mill in time for its first harvest in December of that same year.Our Company
