Our Customers
Our customers are truly the key to our success. We have built relationships with contractors, architects and DIYers who depend on our products every day. Our products are stocked by the leading distributors, retailers and specialty supply houses in each of our core categories. We also supply components in other product manufacturing.
Our Commitment to Innovation
We take great pride in innovation. Along with investments in advanced manufacturing equipment, also invests heavily in research and development. Today, we’ve developed more patents than any competitor in the industry. Often new products and technologies that we bring to market become the industry standard. In the spirit of innovation, we continue to advance water based technology, reducing and in some cases eliminating solvents and VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds). By reducing solvent usage, air pollution is reduced and customers work with safer products. We continue to be focused on minimizing our impact to the environment, while developing new products to serve our customers’ needs.
Our History
From one small plant in Tampa, FL, we’ve expanded across the country to become a premier supplier of packaged coatings, caulks and adhesives. For the last four decades, our business has been proudly owned and operated by the Hyer Family. We remain very active in the community and proudly support both local and national charities.
