The investment supports Project ,  a new global initiative to design and implement  solutions to reduce marine plastic pollution especially in countries with high  leakage of plastics into our oceans.

Chemicals’ investment  will support the first city partnership in Muncar, a coafishing community  located in Banyuwangi, IndoneWith minimal waste services in place, many citizens  are forced to dump their waste directly into the environment. Muncar was chosen  as the first location due to the seriousness of the challenge, coupled  with strong leadership and environmental commitment at national, regency and  local levels.
Project was  co-created in 2017 by Borealis and .
