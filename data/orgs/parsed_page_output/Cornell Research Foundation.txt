Welcome to Knowledge for the greater good
We have taken to heart the revolutionary spirit that founded our university and encourage each other to pursue unpredicted lines of thinking in order to effect change on local and international scales.
Our Profile
is a privately endowed university and a partner of the State University of New York. As the federal land-grant institution in New York State, we have a responsibility—unique within the Ivy League—to make contributions in all fields of knowledge in a manner that prioritizes public engagement to help improve the quality of life in our state, the nation, the world.
Campus Maps & Directions
Success, Loud and Clear
While working for Samuel Morse, Ezra devises a way to use electricity and magnetism to string telegraph wires on glass-insulated poles aboveground. He takes much of his pay in stock, becoming the largest stockholder of Western Union. The success of the telegraph enables him to found University in 1865.
1862-1868
Radical Beginnings
President Lincoln signs the Morrill Act into law. New York State Governor Fenton signs the charter. Together, these signatures establish as New York's first land grant university. Ezra states: "Finally, trust we have laid the of an University—an institution where any person can find instruction in any study."
1868
Chimes Ring Out Over the Hill
The original set of nine bells first ring out from ground level at the University's opening ceremonies October 7, 1868. In 1873 they find a permanent home in McGraw Tower and have since been recast and expanded to 21 bells. They continue to ring daily concerts, making them one of the largest and most frequently played chimes in the world.
1875
Coeducation: The 'Great Experiment'
Sage College welcomes 25 female students, making a pioneer in coeducation and attracting many applicants. Early graduates include two college presidents, Julia Josephine Thomas Irvine (Wellesley) and Martha Carey Thomas (Bryn Mawr); a publisher and author, Ruth Putnam; and noted professor and scientist, Anna Botsford Comstock.
1901
Bye-Bye Winter, Hello Spring
The first recorded "Spring Day" takes place, celebrating the end of winter. Students skip classes and mount variety shows, circuses and even a mock bullfight, among other festivities. Nowadays, Slope Day is held on Libe Slope on the day following the last day of classes and features musical performances.
1906
'...We Shall Transcend All.'
Seven undergraduates found the Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity on campus. Initially started as a study and support group, it becomes the first intercollegiate fraternity for African-American men in the nation and quickly evolves into an organization built on defending the rights of African-Americans through social action.
1940
75 Years of Scholarship
In an address marking the 75th anniversary of the signing of the University charter, distinguished teacher, scholar and historian Carl Becker captures the spirit of the university with a phrase that would become a trademark: freedom and responsibility.
1967
Innovation Underground
At its opening, the Wilson Synchrotron is Cornell's largest single construction and the world's largest particle accelerator, for use in physics, materials science and biology. With expansions over the years, the facility includes a tunnel buried 40 feet beneath Cornell's track complex, creating a giant ring with a half-mile circumference.
1969
Occupy burning crucifix on the porch of the Wari House Black women's housing cooperative compels more than 100 members of the Afro-American Society to occupy Willard Straight Hall for a day and a half. Soon after, 5,000 students take over Barton Hall in support of the Society's demands, prompting decades of sociocultural and political change on campus.
1972
Sagan Greets Aliens
Pioneer 10 begins a 3,000-light-year voyage, the first spacecraft to travel beyond our solar system. In hope of communicating with extraterrestrials, enlists astronomers Frank Drake and Carl Sagan to design a pictorial greeting. The image depicts Earth as the origin of the message.
1977
The Grateful Dead Play Based solely on audience recordings, future Grateful Dead Archivist Dick Latvala declares one show in the band's 1977 tour possibly their best performance ever. That show? The Grateful Dead's concert in Barton Hall on May 8, 1977. The show becomes a "you had to be there" moment and recordings of it are a must-have in any fan's collection.
1997
The Pumpkin That Scaled a Tower
In October, a hollowed-out pumpkin appears atop the spire of McGraw Tower, attracting months of international attention. It sits there, unreachable, for five months until workers testing crane equipment accidentally knock it down. The mystery of how the pumpkin made it there to begin with remains unsolved.
2004
Mars Rover Program is a Go
Twin Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity land on Mars, embarking on three-month missions led by astronomy professor Steve Squyres. Extensive data collected by the rovers in the ten years since have provided new insights into the possibility of water on the red planet and the general composition of Mars.
2008
Water for the People
student-designed water plant brings clean, treated water to the Honduran town of Támara as part of Cornell's AguaClara Project. Led by civil and environmental engineer Monroe Weber-Shirk, the project works with students and villagers to bring cost-effective, municipal-scale water treatment technologies to communities in Honduras and now India.
2010
Pipe Dreams Realized
new baroque organ debuts to a full house in Anabel Taylor Chapel. Construction of the massive, 1,827-pipe instrument—the first in the world to be equipped with wind systems that let it reproduce sounds exactly as Bach and other period composers intended—employed authentic 18th-century techniques.
2017
Tech, Designed for Impact
The first phase of Tech opens on Roosevelt Island, close to the heart of New York City. The campus is a space where graduate students focus on the intersection between technology and entrepreneurship, allowing it to become the urban nexus for fast-tracking tech solutions that have immediate relevance to New York City and the world.
1844
Success, Loud and Clear
While working for Samuel Morse, Ezra devises a way to use electricity and magnetism to string telegraph wires on glass-insulated poles aboveground. He takes much of his pay in stock, becoming the largest stockholder of Western Union. The success of the telegraph enables him to found University in 1865.

Traditions
Dragon Day
Each year in late March, first-year students from the College of Architecture, Art, and Planning (AAP) create and parade an enormous dragon across campus. Accompanied by students in costume and heckled by rivals from the College of Engineering, the dragon lumbers to the Arts Quad to be consumed by a symbolic bonfire. Formalized by students in the 1950s, Dragon Day's roots are actually traced back to the antics of the architecture Class of 1901.
Chimes Concerts
The heartbeat of campus life, the Chimes have been marking the hours and chiming concerts for more than a century. The original set of bells first rang out at the university's opening ceremonies October 7, 1868. The chimes continue to ring daily concerts, making it one of the largest and most frequently played set of chimes in the world.
Homecoming
Meet current students, alumni, faculty, and staff as you cheer on in the traditional homecoming football game. Recent homecoming events have included the Big Red Band, a firework and laser show, and a carnival.
Slope Day
The ultimate celebration of the last day of classes, Slope Day continues a century-long tradition as a year-end gathering. Live musical performances are the main feature of this community fete.
Big Red ice hockey at Lynah Rink is one of Cornell's treasured spectator sports. Learn cheers for the hockey team, or cross off an item on 
the list of 161 things every Cornellian should do
 by joining hundreds of others in camping out for season tickets. The "Lynah Faithful", as they are known, celebrate with the 
Cowbell cheer

All the trappings of a traditional college campus—academic buildings and residence halls, libraries and eateries, labs and facilities—housed in buildings that stand as testimony to our storied past and progressive future. And yet, it's Mother Nature's architecture we think you'll be most impressed by...
Ithaca has been named one of the top 100 places to live, a top 10 recreation city, a best green place to live, and one of the "foodiest" towns in America. For the bustle of city life, head off campus to the Ithaca Commons or Collegetown. Not busy enough? The City of Syracuse is under an hour away, and frequent buses to allow for day trips.

From the laboratory bench to the hospital bedside and from cultural evolution to concepts in sustainability, our researchers and scholars are translating discovery into meaningful, measurable impact that is changing the world for the better.
