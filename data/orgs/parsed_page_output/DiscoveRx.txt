Eurofins is an innovative company that develops, manufactures, and commercializes reagents, complete cell-based assay kits, profiling and screening services as well as other turnkey solutions for the drug discovery, screening, and life science markets. Our biochemical and cell-based assays enable customers to improve research productivity and effectiveness of their screening, lead optimization and campaigns, thus accelerating the discovery and development of new drugs. Plus, with the addition of the BioMAP® platform of human primary cell systems for phenotypic profiling, Eurofins offers a powerful tool to deliver physiologically relevant insights and integrated solutions for all stages of discovery from target and lead discovery to preclinical and beyond.
Business Overview
Acquired by Eurofins Pharma Discovery Services in 2017, Eurofins is dedicated to the development and commercialization of innovative solutions for discovery research.
Proven Technology
The Company pioneered the use of β-galactosidase enzyme fragment complementation (EFC) for discovery research. technology is a proven, established screening platform in most major pharmaceutical companies and our EFC-based HitHunter
®
 cassays are the market leader in screening applications. PathHunter
®
 and InHunter™ technology platforms, an adaptation of technology, are an innovative and comprehensive assay system that enables live cell-based assays for pathway profiling and compound screening.
In addition to the platform, Eurofins also holds extensive intellectual property for its second core technology, an
 in vitro
 binding assay platform called KINOME
scan
SM
. Through our core technologies, Eurofins is able to offer assay solutions for every major class of drug target, including GPCRs, kinases, bromodomains, methyltranseferases, proteases, nuclear hormone receptors, cytokines, transcription factors and secreted proteins.
Corporate Partnerships
Eurofins remains committed to fully exploit the commercial potential of its as well as KINOME
scan
 technology either solely or with its corporate partners.  Eurofins values such partnerships and is actively seeking additional collaborative alliances to commercialize and provide early access to new technology platforms in the drug discovery and development markets.

Eurofins Acquires Eurofins Scientific (EUFI.PA), a world leader in providing analytical support to the global pharmaceutical industry, announces that it has signed an agreement to acquire DiscoverX, a leader in drug discovery products and services across all stages of discovery from target identification and lead discovery to preclinical and beyond. The transaction is expected to close in the coming weeks, upon fulfillment of customary closing conditions.
is an innovative company that develops, manufactures, and commercializes reagents, complete cell-based assay kits, profiling and screening services as well as other disruptive solutions for the drug discovery, screening, and life science markets. The company has over 15 years’ experience in drug discovery and development leveraging on the Enzyme Fragment Complementation (EFC) technology and has become a reputable market leader in screening applications. technology is a proven, established screening platform in most major pharmaceutical companies. With over 900 stable cell lines, 4500 drug discovery assays and kits, and both custom and off-the shelf services, is one of the most trusted and utilized drug discovery portfolios in the world. The company employs 137 staff in four locations in Fremont, San Diego, San Francisco (California) and Birmingham (England).
The combination of Eurofins Pharma Discovery Services and provides the pharmaceutical and biotech industries with a partner of choice for end-to-end drug discovery services, enabling customers to improve research productivity and effectiveness of their screening, lead optimization and structure-activity relationships (SAR) campaigns, thus accelerating the discovery and development of new drugs. In addition, DiscoverX’s KINOMEscan platform and epigenetics services, combined with Eurofins Pharma Discovery’s kinase profiling services would result in the largest available portfolio of kinase products and services in the market. Furthermore, it provides researchers with a comprehensive technology platform for assessment of drugs to kinases, the most widely evaluated drug target.
DiscoverX’s expertise complements Eurofins discovery pharmacology capabilities following the previous acquisitions of Panlabs, Cerep, Millipore Discovery and Development Solutions and Villapharma. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing R&outsourcing market in the and provides a gateway to the Asia-Pacific region.
Comment from Dr. Gilles Martin, Eurofins’ CEO: “adds another spectrum of new advanced services that Eurofins can now offer to its clients. This transaction is another demonstration of Eurofins’ commitment to provide the most comprehensive portfolio of laboratory services in the discovery pharmacology field which enjoys a strong outsourcing growth trend.”
