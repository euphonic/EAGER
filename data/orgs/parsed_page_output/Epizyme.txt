Epizyme’s vision is to rewrite therapy for cancer and other serious diseases through targeted epigenetic medicines. We aspire to change the standard of care for patients and physicians by developing medicines with fundamentally new mechanisms of action.
We are focused on creating medicines that are targeted at specific causes of diseases, that are orally administered, tolerable, easy to take, and that are based on a deep understanding of the patients that will benefit from them.
Since 2011, we have discovered five novel epigenetic therapies, three of which are in clinical development and two that have begun or will soon begin IND-enabling studies.
Our pioneering work in epigenetic drug development is led by the advancement of tazemetostat in a number of cancer indications and treatment settings. Our unique scientific capabilities have enabled us to expand our platform into new epigenetic target classes likely to be highly important in disease biology. Our discovery research is yielding exciting new targets for which we are developing novel small molecule programs with the goal of creating a sustainable pipeline of clinical candidates. This includes our most recent drug development candidate, EZM8266, which will begin IND-enabling studies in 2018, for the potential treatment of sickle cell disease. To help further accelerate our portfolio, we have established a foundation of strategic collaborations with biopharmaceutical leaders.
At Epizyme, our exceptional team is wholly dedicated to bringing epigenetic therapies to the many patients who can benefit from them. We believe that we have the opportunity to change the lives of patients living with cancer and other serious diseases and are well positioned to deliver on our multi-year vision.
