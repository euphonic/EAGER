By using a network of qualified and trained recovery partners, one of the most stringent screening and recovery protocols, patented tissue-cleaning and sterilization processes, and a highly controlled processing environment, we counter the risk of disease transmission at every step.
Quality
Health’s controlled processing environment is designed to ensure tissue quality and safety. Through the consistent application of quality systems, quality control, and design control processes, tissue graft are designed and manufactured to ensure highest possible quality. Year after year, this dedication to quality is validated internally and vetted by your peers as well as government and industry regulators. holds the longest running current accreditation by the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB). Our certifications and memberships include AATB, (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Ammendments), registration, 13485 (Standard for medical devices) and (United Network of Organ Sharing).

Institute of Regenerative Medicine
Established in 2012, the Institute of Regenerative Medicine is a division of and serves as a global center of excellence for research and development.  Its focus is on new medical applications for allografts and tissue engineering to maximize the gift of donation.
Its mission is to apply the principles of regenerative medicine to enhance the efficacy of bioimplants for saving and improving the lives of patients and develop novel therapeutic approaches derived from, or designed to enhance the efficacy of, tissue allografts and organ transplantation.
As home to the Health’s Research and Development operations, the Institute of Regenerative Medicine is committed to improving healing in the areas that has served for 30 years - bone, cardiovascular, skin, sports medicine, spine, craniomaxillofacial, dental, and organ transplantation.  These achievements further the Institute’s goal to develop innovative or novel uses of donor tissues and organs through sound scientific and clinical research.
Saving Lives. Restoring Health. Giving Hope.
Saving Lives, Restoring and Giving Hope isn’t just our mission; it has been our sole motivation since 1982. That commitment has driven us to become a world leader in allograft bio-implants, with an unmatched safety record that makes us the most-trusted partner in the field.

Tissue Services Division
Tissue Services Division is dedicated to training, educating and maintaining relationships with numerous partners in order to promote donation in their respective communities.
The Tissue Services Division customizes and coordinates services to meet the specific needs of our recovery partners.  The Department of Tissue Client Relations functions as the primary contact for all recovery partner operational needs. Each recovery partner is assigned a team of experienced staff, led and coordinated by the partner's primary Tissue Client Relations Representative, all to handle the essential administrative, regulatory and compliance issues.  Our Tissue Development team allows for an efficient, easy-to-communicate process to assist recovery partners.
The Technical Training and Education department offers personal consultation services for all recovery operations. Planned, periodic on-site training that offers technical recovery guidance to optomize the donation is provided, as well as educational opportunities that assist the partner's staff to better understand donor suitability criteria and rationale. Effective, open communication with our partners is the hallmark of the valuable information exchange between us that guides our collective efforts to fulfill our donation missions.
Donation Center Coordinators work to facilitate tissue and organ donation and transplantation by decisively managing critical information.  The Donor Center operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and employs trained medical staff and allied healthcare professionals.  Our highly trained team work together to evaluate routine hospital telephone referrals, analyze donor information in real time and facilitate the consent process.
Health's Quality Assurance procedures ensure the safety of tissue by performing multiple record reviews prior to releasing any grafts for transplantation.  Each member works directly with the Quality Control Laboratory and Tissue Development team to determine if all information meets established acceptance criteria. Health's Medical Directors and well-trained specialists ensure that only the highest quality grafts are released.

Collaborative Donation Process
vigorously supports the concept of "Hospital Ownership of Organ Donation" when this 
ownership is a part of a collaborative effort to enhance donation awareness and support among hospital staff. To this end, the healthcare professionals of provide the hospital the resources it needs to ensure all staff members are educated in the need for, value of, and current practice of donation and transplantation.
In the spirit of collaboration, works closely with your hospital to help you provide quality care and personal attention to families facing the death of a loved one. The following information will help orient you to the nature and extent of our collaborative relationship.
What Are OPOs?

	Not-for-profit Organ Procurement Organizations (OPOs), like Health, are federally designated by The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to serve specific regions of the country and were established to:
Educate the public about benefits of organ donation and transplantation
Recover, preserve and distribute donated organs
Increase the availability of organs for transplantation
Support, promote and assist tissue donation
Medicare Conditions of Participation

	The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has included in its Conditions of

	Participation a requirement that all hospitals refer all deaths and imminent deaths to the local in a timely manner.
Hospitals are reviewed for compliance by Joint Commission and Medicare. To help ensure the hospital

	performs well in this review, Helath staff prepares a review of the hospital's donation process by reviewing the hospital's medical records. then shares with you any opportunities for

	improvement, both to avoid any future survey challenges with and Joint Commission and to help you help your families in crisis.
Hospital /Collaboration
Educate hospital staff on the donation process
Ensure potential donors receive appropriate and aggressive treatment to allow the opportunity for organ and tissue donation
Present families of deceased patients with organ and tissue donation options
Manage the potential donor while testing and placement are performed
Review death records
Why is Collaboration So Important?

	Working together is the only way we can prevent the harmful and untimely request for consent, help the family have the opportunity for organ and tissue donation, and maintain the viability of organs upon the death of the donor.
Who Health?

	is certified by to facilitate the donation and transplantation process within the state of Virginia as well as parts of West Virginia. collaborates with approximately 72 area hospitals and the Office of the Chief Medical Examiners to provide donation-related services, including:
Supporting potential donor families in their time of loss
Coordinating the recovery of all medically suitable organs and tissues for transplant
Ensure organs are effectively placed with 5 regional and many national transplant centers
Additionally, provides after care support to donor families and educates the diverse

	communities of Virginia about organ and tissue donation and transplantation.
