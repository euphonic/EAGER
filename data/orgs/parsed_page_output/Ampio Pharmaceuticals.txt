General email inquiries:  info@ampiopharma.comOsteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis, affecting over 100 million people in the United States with over 48 million people suffering from osteoarthritis of the knee. It is a progressive disorder of the joints involving degradation of the intra-articular cartilage, joint lining, ligaments, and bone. The incidence of developing osteoarthritis of the knee over a lifetime is approximately 45%. Certain risk factors in conjunction with natural wear and tear lead to the breakdown of cartilage. Osteoarthritis is a chronic, progressive condition caused by inflammation of the soft tissue and bony structures of the joint, which worsens over time and leads to progressive thinning of articular cartilage. Other progressive effects include narrowing of the joint space, synovial membrane inflammation and thickening, osteophyte formation and increased density of subchondral bone. Inflammation of the synovium interrupts the natural chondrocyte metabolism, which is responsible for the production and maintenance of cartilage’s extracellular matrix. Osteoarthritic synovial fluid activates pro-inflammatory cytokines in active chondrocytes through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. The cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-), interleukin-17 (IL-17), and interleukin-18 (IL-18), stimulate the synthesis of matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) whose enzymatic activity leads to the degeneration of cartilage.
The global osteoarthritis therapeutics market continues to expand and is expected to exceed $3 billion by 2015. Despite the size and growth of the osteoarthritis of the knee market, few adequate treatment options currently exist for this chronic, debilitating disease.

Edward Brody, MD, PhD, a physician, molecular biologist, biochemist and biophysicist by training, is the Chief Medical Officer Emeritus of SomaLogic Inc. and Adjunct Professor, Department of Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology at the University of Colorado, Boulder. Dr. Brody served as Vice President, Drug Discovery, NeXstar Pharmaceuticals, Boulder, Colorado from 1998 to 1999 and has been working in proteomics at SomaLogic since its inception in 2000. Proteomics is a branch of biotechnology concerned with applying the techniques of molecular biology, biochemistry, and genetics to analyzing the structure, function, and interactions of the proteins produced by the genes of a particular cell, tissue, or organism, with organizing the information in databases, and with applications of the data. The company has developed protein-binding reagents and technologies that can efficiently, accurately and rapidly identify and quantify 5,000 proteins across approximately eight logs of concentration in small sample volumes that support advanced biomarker discovery, diagnostics development, and pharmaceutical discovery and development.
Dr. Brody earned his (1964) and Phin Biochemistry (1965) from the University of Chicago and accepted a Postdoctoral Fellow position at the Department of Biophysics, Laboratory of Geiduschek in Chicago. He then went to Geneva, Switzerland (1965-1968) and continued his research as a Postdoctoral Fellow, Department of Molecular Biology. Dr. Brody moved from Geneva to the Biochemistry Department of the Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique, Paris, France and joined the French National Research Council (C.N.R.S.) in 1971 as “Chargé de Recherche” and was promoted to the position of “Maître de Recherche” in 1973. In 1983, Dr. Brody took a sabbatical to the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, working in John Abelson’s laboratory studying the splicing of pre-min cerevisiae and was able to label, isolate, and prove the structure of an in vivo generated lariat intron and then found that in vitro splicing takes place specifically on a 40particle which he named the spliceosome. Their article in Science (228, 963-7, [1986]) was one of the 100 most cited life science articles for the year 1985.
Returning to France in August, 1985, Dr. Brody worked on mammalian pre-msplicing, and in particular on tissue specific splicing, skeletal muscle-specific splicing of b-tropomyosin pre-mand in 1988, moved to Gif-sur-Yvette, where splicing was the major pursuit of the laboratory. In 1992, Dr. Brody was recruited to become Professor, Chairman of the Department of Biology, Department of Biological Sciences Buffalo, USA.
Dr. Brody is the author of a large number of research papers in the field of molecular biology and proteomics.
Pablo Rubinstein, MD, a surgeon and immunogeneticist by training, is the founder and director of the National Cord Blood Program at the New York Blood Center (NYBC), where he developed the first public cord blood banking system. He has played a leading role in international cord blood transplantation in which the stem cells from the placenta and umbilical cord blood of unrelated donors are used to treat, by hematopoietic transplantation, leukemia, lymphoma and other neoplastic diseases of the blood. More than seventy genetic diseases, such as Hurler’s disease, Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), Severe Aplastic Anemia and Sickle Cell disease have been treated successfully with cord blood transplantation. His peer-reviewed publications teaching the processing methods he developed and generous training of an international fellowship of physicians and blood bankers at the cell processing laboratory have stimulated and led to the establishment of more than 100 public cord blood banks in thirty countries and an inventory of more than 600,000 cryogenically stored cord blood units from ethnically diverse donors. These cord blood banks have provided most of the over thirty thousand cord blood transplants to date.
Milestones accomplished by Dr. Rubinstein and his team in the development of this new field of medicine include providing the first unrelated stem cell transplant for hematopoietic reconstitution, receiving the first from the that allowed cord blood processing and freezing for transplantation to proceed (1996) and, in November 2011, the first Biologics License issued by the for any stem cell preparation.
Dr. Rubinstein earned his medical degree from the Universidad de Chile in 1962 and completed a surgical residency at Hospital Clinico of the Universidad de Chile, followed by a fellowship at the Bassett Hospital, Columbia University. He also completed a National Institutes of Health (NIH) International Postdoctoral Research fellowship at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. His study of immunogenetics, which encompasses the structure and function of genes that regulate immune responses, control the acceptance or rejection of tissue and organ transplants, and affect susceptibility to certain types of diseases, led to his appointment as an investigator at the Lindsley Kimball Research Institute at the New York Blood Center (NYBC) and eventually as Director of the Fred Allen Jr. Laboratory of Immunogenetics. He served as Clinical Professor in the Pathology Department at Columbia University School of Medicine.
He has also conducted collaborative research on the Genetics of Juvenile (Type I) Diabetes Mellitus in humans and showed that the disease is inherited as a recessive gene with incomplete penetrance through genes in the region. He has also conducted studies on the genetic structure of the region in humans and its homologs in other species and shown the genetic linkage of several components of the complement system including Factor in the alternative pathway and C2 and C4, active in the classical pathway.
He has also worked in the genetics of human blood groups and discovered the existence of Fy6, an allele of the Duffy blood group system that serves as the receptor for the binding of vivax malaria merozoites.
Dr. Rubinstein is the author of more than 270 research papers on immunogenetics, cord blood banking and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

General email inquiries:  info@ampiopharma.comAbout Diabetic Macular Edema
Type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus affects 26 million people in the United States. One of the many symptoms of diabetes is the local and systemic inflammation of the microvascular system. Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes and is characterized by damage to the blood vessels of the retina and can either be proliferative or non-proliferative. Proliferative damage occurs when a reduction in oxygen levels in the retina due to impaired glucose metabolism causes fragile blood vessels to grow in the vitreous humor. Non-proliferative damage occurs when existing vessels experience poor endothelial cell linkage due to increased blood glucose levels and hypertension. Macular edema is the most common form of non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. In diabetic macular edema, prolonged hyperglycemia compromises endothelial cell linkage leading to vascular permeability. The leakage of fluid, solutes, proteins and immune cells cause the macula to swell and thicken. This leads to damage of the central retinal tissue and cany significantly impair sharp central vision. The prevalence of diabetes is 11.3% of the population above the age of 20, with an annual incidence of 1.9 million cases in the United States alone. In this population, the prevalence of diabetic macular edema is estimated at 30% of patients inflicted by the disease for 20 years or more.

About Osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis (OA) is an incurable and progressive disorder of the joints involving degradation of the intra-articular cartilage, joint lining, ligaments, and bone. The incidence of developing osteoarthritis of the knee over a lifetime is approximately 45%. As this disease is associated with age, obesity, and diabetes, this number will continue to grow. Certain risk factors in conjunction with natural wear and tear lead to the breakdown of cartilage. Osteoarthritis is caused by inflammation of the soft tissue and bony structures of the joint, which worsens over time and leads to progressive thinning of articular cartilage. Other symptoms include narrowing of the joint space, synovial membrane thickening, osteophyte formation and increased density of subchondral bone.
About Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a development stage biopharmaceutical company primarily focused on the development of therapies to treat prevalent inflammatory conditions for which there are limited treatment options. We are developing compounds that decrease inflammation by (i) inhibiting specific pro-inflammatory compounds by affecting specific pathways at the protein expression and at the transcription level; (ii) activating specific phosphatase or depletion of the available phosphate needed for the inflammation process; and (iii) decreasing vascular permeability.

About Ampion™ for the Treatment of pain due to Osteoarthritis of the Knee
Ampion is a low molecular weight fraction of human serum albumin (HSA) currently being developed for the treatment of pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee.
The primary constituent ingredient of Ampion is aspartyl-alanyl diketopiperazine, or DA-DKP, an endogenous immunomodulatory molecule derived from the N-terminus of Based on published pre-clinical and clinical research, DA-plays a significant role in the regulation of inflammation. DA-is believed to reduce inflammation by suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokine production in T-cells. Ampion also contains other known small molecules that confer anti-inflammatory effects to complement the activity of DA-and derive demonstrated 
in-vitro
 and 
in-vivo
 effects. We believe this non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory biologic agent has the potential to treat a broad range of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions as well as immune-mediated diseases. is currently developing Ampion as an intra-articular injection to treat osteoarthritis of the knee, and the final pivotal trial is underway.  Additional pre-clinical and clinical studies have been completed or are underway for Ampion and other chronic inflammatory conditions. Fifty six patents are currently issued for Ampion throughout the world.

Contact UsAbout Optina for the Oral Treatment of Diabetic Macular Edema
Optina is a novel, ultra-low dose of danazol being developed for the oral treatment of diabetic macular edema.
Danazol is an established, synthetic derivative of modified testosterone ethisterone that affects vascular endothelial cell linkage in a biphasic manner. Ultra-low dose danazol (as formulated in Optina) decreases vascular permeability by increasing the barrier function across endothelial cells, indicating the potential to treat multiple angiopathies. Further, danazol increases intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels through the rapid activation of membrane-associated androgen, steroid binding globulin, and calcium channel receptors. With the ultra-low dose contained in our novel Optina formulation, danazol binds to androgen and steroid binding globulin receptors stimulating the formation of a cortical actin ring to enhance endothelial cell barrier function. When organized into a cortical ring, filamentous actin (f-actin) increases the barrier function of endothelial cells by tethering adhesion molecule complexes to the cytoskeleton. In this orientation, increased cortical actin improves tight junctions which strengthen cell-to-cell adhesions, thereby restricting leakage (edema) across the cell membrane. large, late-stage clinical trial is identified to start in the for the oral treatment of diabetic macular edema. Additional future indications for Optina are being researched. One hundred thirty four patents are currently issued for Optina with 50 pending applications worldwide.
