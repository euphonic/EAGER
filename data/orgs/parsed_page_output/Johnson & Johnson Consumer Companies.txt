北京大宝化妆品有限公司成立于1999年，是北京市三露厂成功进行股份制改造的结果 (北京三露厂始建于1985年) 。强生(中国) 投资有限公司于2008年7月30日完成收购北京大宝化妆品有限公司的交易，大宝品牌及公司正式成为强生大家庭中的一员，从此，强生信条指引新的大宝公司全力实现对客户，员工，社会和股东的责任。
面临新的发展机遇，公司管理层提出了“成为中国领先且最受大众喜爱的护肤品公司，并不断致力于为客户、员工和社会提供简单务实的关爱” 的公司发展愿景，同时提出了为实现这一愿景所要执行的战略：1，持续创造英雄单品 2，全方位塑造简单务实的关爱 3，建立以多快好省为目标的管理体系 4，培育具有国际公司理念且精通中国大众市场的人才。
多年来，大宝公司始终秉承“物超所值，服务大众”的宗旨，推陈出新，不断满足日益变化的消费者需求。“大宝”系列化妆品1985年诞生至今，适应了不同时期、不同层次的消费需求。诞生于1990年的大宝品牌“SOD蜜”, 及其后的“美容日霜”和“SOD蛋白蜜”都成为中国市场上家喻户晓产品。从2009年开始，大宝公司又成功推出了‘SOD滋润霜’，‘SOD清爽保湿露’以及‘清爽保湿洁面乳’等新产品，为消费者提供了更多物超所值的选择。
大宝公司始终把员工发展放在重要战略位置，从2009年起，为实现战略目标、提高组织效率、使员工更好的遵守职业道德，明确做事原则，公司推出了《大宝公司员工行为典范》。行为典范由一个核心要素-勇担责任，四个关键要素-紧迫感、变革心、协作力及时效性共同组成。
大宝公司始终持续不断在社会公益事业上做出突出贡献。在强生信条的指引下，制定了“扶助弱势群体”及“关注环保”两大公益主题。自2009年以来，公司又先后捐资用于植树造林、资助听障儿童康复等公益事业，包括与中华残疾人福利基金会及中国狮子会一道，积极支持中国聋儿康复事业；与中华环境保护基金会一起，在河北省丰宁县开展植树造林项目；致力于改善首都环境质量，与北京绿化基金会共同协作，在内蒙古多伦县开辟“大宝生态园”。
