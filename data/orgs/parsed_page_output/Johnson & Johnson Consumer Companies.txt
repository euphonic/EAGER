大宝公司始终把员工发展放在重要战略位置，从2009年起，为实现战略目标、提高组织效率、使员工更好的遵守职业道德，明确做事原则，公司推出了《大宝公司员工行为典范》。行为典范由一个核心要素-勇担责任，四个关键要素-紧迫感、变革心、协作力及时效性共同组成。
大宝公司始终持续不断在社会公益事业上做出突出贡献。在强生信条的指引下，制定了“扶助弱势群体”及“关注环保”两大公益主题。自2009年以来，公司又先后捐资用于植树造林、资助听障儿童康复等公益事业，包括与中华残疾人福利基金会及中国狮子会一道，积极支持中国聋儿康复事业；与中华环境保护基金会一起，在河北省丰宁县开展植树造林项目；致力于改善首都环境质量，与北京绿化基金会共同协作，在内蒙古多伦县开辟“大宝生态园”。
