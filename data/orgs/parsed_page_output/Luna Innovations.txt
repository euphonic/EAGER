About Mission
To help advance the continuing increase in data transmission rates for the public & private communications network with high speed optical test products, while also leveraging our unique fiber optic sensing technology to improve the structural testing of new composite elements and components in new aircraft and automobiles.
Vision
To be a leader in optical technology, providing unique capabilities in high performance fiber optic test products for the telecommunications industry and distributed fiber optic sensing for the aerospace and automotive industries.
Our history
(NASDAQ: LUNA) was founded in 1990 and has been successful in taking innovative technologies from the applied research stage to product development and ultimately to the commercial market. In some cases, the successes led to the creation of independent businesses. We have created companies in our area of focus, sold some of them to industry leaders in their fields, raised private capital, formed joint ventures and entered into a number of licensing agreements.
We are a Virginia-based company with a diverse team of scientists, engineers, and business professionals developing and manufacturing a new generation of technologies and products. We employ a disciplined and integrated business model designed to accelerate the process of bringing innovative solutions to market.
