R&Group
SDI’s R&groups are operating within Materials R&Center, Small-Sized Li-ion Battery Division, Automotive & Battery Division, and Electronic Materials Division. All the groups collabo­rate with each other to strengthen SDI’s global leadership in technology
R&Experts
has around 2,300 R&experts and the percentage of R&employees with a Master’s and/or Ph.degree is 39%. In order to strengthen the ability of R&workforce, operates a learning group where employees share their experience and knowledge. To nurture the global talents, in addition, the company has increased its support through various systems including academic training, in-house technology college, locally-led global talent nurturing center, the operation of a global educational portal, and dissemination of excellent educational contents.
Divisional R&D
Establishing Materials R&Center’s Mid/long-term Strategies
has established and has been operating mid/long-term strategies in order to secure product leadership. Based on established strategies, plans to structure the scientific technology-management system built on big data to establish a ‘Strong and Lively R&Center’.
Strengthening R&Partnership
In order to take a lead in the ever-changing technology and market environment, has been strengthening its R&partnership. conducts joint R&projects with domestic/ international universities and research institutes, to develop forward-looking element technologies and commercialize them. In addition, the company expands its overseas R&locations to structure a system where, all pro­cesses from development to completion can be taken care of locally. At the same time, concentrates on technologies such as cutting-edge battery materials at the ‘Material Research Complex’ while collaborating with other affiliated companies located in the complex to generate synergy.
Strengthening R&in Li-ion Battery Material
Recently, the core of Li-ion battery market has moved from small-sized Li-ion bat­teries to medium-to-large Li-ion batteries, including automotive Li-ion batteries and As it is becoming more important to increase the driving range while charging electric vehicles, and to secure competitiveness in system solutions, focuses on developing technologies that can overcome limitations of the current materials. As more devices are using Li-ion batteries, and the competition amongst companies intensifies, the company is increasing research and development on up­grading existing materials and new materials with high-capacity to maximize usage time of applications and reduce charging time of Li-ion batteries
Acquiring various flexible battery technology
In these days, interest in wearable devices is getting higher. Recent innovations in healthcare band, smartwatch, and glass help us to see the growth potential of the flexible battery. In November 2014, unveiled world’s first flexible battery which is not only bendable but also rollable. Applying our own technology - flexible structure design and material technology, our flexible battery is so durable that it still works after going through tens of thousands of bending test. We now focus on improving the technology maturity in order to apply to various kinds of wearable devices.
Materials
Electronic Materials
strives to develop core materials of cutting-edge products - such as semiconductors, displays, new energy solutions - in a timely manner. We are especially focusing on securing the technology quality in pursuit of development of competitive products. In 2014, we developed high-efficiency electrode pastes, evaporation materials for allow longevity and high efficiency, next-generation materials enable high-resolution. We aim to lead both the present market and the next-generation core material market, through developing materials, highly advanced polarization films, and high-brightness CR.
Konzession
Creating synergy for Intellectual Property has built a foundation to demonstrate synergy with patents not only in the field of battery materials but also in the field of future energy materials. In particular, we are pioneering potential business fields by finding competitive patents through intensive support for major challenges in the next-generation battery and materials fields. filed 59,498 patents in the first quarter of 2015, maintaining 14,668 registered patents. Especially, we have secured 8,329 registered patents in major markets such as the US, Europe, and China, and are strengthening our responsiveness in the global market.
