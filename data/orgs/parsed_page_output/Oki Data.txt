Amid large changes in the business environment, we seek to embed these principles as extensively as we can into our practices with the commitments expressed in the Group Charter of Corporate Conduct and the Group Code of Conduct as the cornerstones of our corporate activities. We seek to realize our corporate philosophy by striving to embody our vision.
