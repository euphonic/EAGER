Shinya Kamagami
As Japan's pioneering manufacturer of telecommunications equipment, got its start in 1881 when founder Kibataro manufactured Japan's first telephone. Since then, its spirit of proactively tackling the challenges of new frontiers has been documented and handed down to this day. The corporate philosophy, captured in the words: "The people of OKI, true to the company's "enterprising spirit," are committed to creating superior network solutions and providing excellent information and communications services globally to meet the diversified needs of communities worldwide in the information age."
The Group helps people around the world lead more comfortable and richer lives based on this philosophy and through sound business activities implemented in accordance with both common sense and applicable laws and regulations. We believe the foundations for increasing corporate value lie in earning the trust of all our stakeholders, including shareholders, investors, employees, business partners, and local communities, as well as in delivering peace of mind to customers at all times through our business activities.
Based on this philosophy and understanding, as a company that supports society's infrastructures, we deliver bank branch systems for financial institutions; telecommunications infrastructure and communication systems for enterprises; and transportation systems including flight control and Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) systems, as well as high-end consigned electronic manufacturing services reflecting our 135 years of technologies and experience.

Smaintains a corporate auditor system, with the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board. With an executive officer system in place, it strives to promote timely decision making processes by separating business execution and oversight.
It endeavors to improve the fairness and transparency of management by nominating outside directors to the Board as well as setting up a voluntary committee on nomination, remuneration, etc. so as to ensure effective supervision from an independent and objective standpoint.
The Board of Directors in principle meets once a month but can call extraordinary meetings when necessary, and is responsible for deciding fundamental management policies and other important matters and overseeing business execution. To enhance management fairness and transparency, four of the Board's seven members (including one female member) are outside directors with a high level of independence. The chairman presides over meetings of the Board of Directors. To clarify management responsibility for each fiscal year, directors are appointed for single-year terms.
The Audit & Supervisory Board comprises four Audit & Supervisory Board members, two of which are outside Audit & Supervisory Board members with a high level of independence. Based on audit policies, methods, etc. decided at Audit & Supervisory Board meetings, Audit & Supervisory Board members attend Board of Directors' meetings and other important meetings, verify the content of reports received from directors, etc., and conduct investigations into matters concerning the Company's operations, financial status, etc. Collaborating closely with outside directors, the Internal Auditing Division, and the accounting auditors, Audit & Supervisory Board members audit the performance of duties by directors.
The Group recognizes sustainable growth and increasing corporate value over mid- and long-term as its most important management priorities in earning the trust of its various stakeholders. To this end, we are working to bolster and enhance corporate governance based on our fundamental policies, including "enhancement of management fairness and transparency," "timely decision-making processes," and "full compliance and fortification of risk management."
appoints executive officers to implement operations in accordance with management policies determined by the Board of Directors so as to separate the functions of business execution and oversight of management and promote timely decision-making processes. Moreover, to assist the president in making decisions, the Company has established the Management Committee.
has established the Personnel Affairs and Compensation Advisory Committee as a voluntary committee to secure transparency in the decision-making processes for appointments of board members and executive officers and remuneration for them. Outside directors play leading roles on the committee. After deliberating from an objective perspective on appointments or dismissals of board members and executive officers as well as the structure and level of their compensation etc., the committee reports its findings to the Board of Directors.
Internal Auditing
The Internal Auditing Division is tasked with internal auditing and its staff comprises nine internal auditors. The division must accurately perceive the actual state of compliance risk management across businesses and functions in the Group, and on that basis conduct internal audits for the purpose of identifying and preventing mistakes and errors as well as corruption in the operation of internal control systems with the goal of supporting operational improvements.

In order to secure transparency and objectiveness in the decision-making processes concerning compensation for officers, the Personnel Affairs and Compensation Advisory Committee deliberates on the structure and level of compensation for directors and executive officers from an objective viewpoint, and reports the results to the Board of Directors.
OKI's basic policy on compensation for directors and executive officers is to serve as incentives for the performance improvement with the aim of the continuous enhancement of the corporate value and the corporate competitiveness while being the compensation structure that can attract excellent human resources.
The compensation system consists of basic compensation, annual incentive compensation linked to the performance of each fiscal year, and compensation-type stock option as medium- to long-term incentive compensation. These changes have been implemented as part of efforts to develop an environment for a shift to the management focused on "more aggressive goal setting" and "growth over medium- to long-term" in order to achieve "continuous growth" of the Group.
Type
When serving as executive officer concurrently, monetary compensation shall be paid, determined individually tailored to position, followed by duties.
Annual incentive
compensation
Monetary compensation shall be paid, determined individually with a linkage with the past fiscal year's consolidated business performance of the Group and that of the division each director/executive officer is responsible for. The amount of payments is 35% of the basic compensation in case that the rate of payments is 100%. The rate of payments is determined within the scope of 0% to 200%, according to a linkage with business performance and the President's qualitative assessment.
Medium- to long-term incentive compensation
Compensation-type stock option shall be granted, around 13% of basic compensation amount, in the view of value sharing with shareholders and the enhancement of corporate value as well as shareholders' value over the medium- to long-term.
Compensation for outside directors consists only of basic compensation. In addition, the appropriateness of the structure and level of compensation is validated utilizing objective evaluation from external organizations and others.

The Group regards environmental management as an integration of its business management activities and environmental management activities. is pursuing environmental management throughout the supply chain in Japan and overseas, and is working to reduce environmental impact while ensuring business merits at each stage of the product life cycle (*) .
At production sites, this leads to energy-saving/resource conservation from the viewpoint of reduction of environmental impact and directly links to the reduction of production cost from the perspective of benefits for business. Also, at the stage of product usage by the customer, it ties directly to the reduction of production costs. At the customer usage stage, we broadly classify products into those that cycle between standby and startup, such as ATMs and printers, and those that operate continually such as communication equipment. The "Environmental Report 2018" addresses a broad range of life-cycle environmental management case studies in Japan and overseas.
As one example, Electric Industry (Shenzhen) (OSZ) in Shenzhen, China, which manufactures such products as Group's ATMs, cooperated with suppliers to change the cardboard packaging of procured parts to a returnable plastic box. This succeeded in halving the usage of cardboard. Additionally, the form of the returnable box has been shaped to enable the opened box to be placed into the production line as is, thereby reducing the cost of parts management.
Moving forward, the Group is committed to pursuing various efforts to improve operating efficiency, visualizing relevant information, and promoting environmental legal compliance. Beyond this, is constantly seeking to strengthen corporate value by improving its environmentally friendly products and securing business opportunities.
