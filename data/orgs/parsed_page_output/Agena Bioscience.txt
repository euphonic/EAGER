21 August 2018
Combining LabChip® Touch Nucleic Acid Analyzer and MassARRAY® for Optimized Liquid Biopsy Workflow
San Diego, – (Agena) announced today that they have entered into a collaboration with PerkinElmer, incorporating the LabChip® Touch™ nucleic acid analyzer for quality assessment and quantitation of in the upfront workflow of Agena’s MassARRAY® system. The companies have focused on targeting ctin oncology liquid biopsy, where the combined systems support a low cost, yet highly robust, single-day sample to results workflow for laboratories.
“We found the speed of Agena’s Massworkflow and the sensitivity of their UltraSEEK® liquid biopsy assay to be an ideal pairing with the rapid quality assessment using our LabChip Touch system,” said Mark Dupal, PerkinElmer’s Global Portfolio Manager of Automation and Microfluidics, Applied Genomics.
PerkinElmer’s LabChip Touch nucleic acid analyzer provides accurate electrophoretic visual quality assessment and quantitation down to 25 pg/µl for in as little as 30 seconds with flexible sample throughput options including 96-well and 384-well. This provides a streamlined upfront process to Agena’s 96 and 384-chip systems and the Ultrachemistry for liquid biopsy.
“The LabChip Touch system gives our customers a new option to analyze quality that is consistent with the overall value proposition that we offer,” said Mickie Henshall, of Marketing at Bioscience. “We look forward to working with PerkinElmer to provide this comprehensive solution with our cost effective and rapid workflows.”
In evaluations performed by Agena’s Scientific Affairs team, the LabChip system ensured that sufficient was present in the sample to achieve the sensitivity capabilities of the Ultrachemistry while efficiently identifying samples compromised by pre-analytical variables that could result in false negative results.
“Controlling pre-analytical variables is an important component of delivering robust reproducible liquid biopsy analysis. The combination of LabChip Touch nucleic acid analyzer’s sample qualification with Ultraassay’s highly sensitive, multiplexed chemistry delivers a powerful liquid biopsy sample-to-result solution” said Darryl Irwin, Sr. Director of Scientific Affairs at Bioscience. “We believe this collaboration will provide many benefits to customers by optimizing their liquid biopsy performance”.
About develops, manufactures, and supplies genetic analysis systems and reagents, including the MassSystem. The system is a highly sensitive, cost-effective, mass spectrometry-based platform for high-throughput genetic analysis, and is used globally in diverse research fields such as cancer profiling for solid tumors and liquid biopsies, inherited genetic disease testing, pharmacogenetics, agricultural genomics, and clinical research.

1 November 2018
San Diego, CA, November 1, 2018 – Bioscience, a global provider of molecular testing solutions, today announced the release of the Chimeric Panel designed to reduce the time and cost of performing chimerism analysis for bone marrow engraftment monitoring studies. The SNP-based panel is designed for research use with the MassARRAY® system and is accompanied by software which calculates the composition of a post-transplant follow-up specimen in seconds and displays the results in an easy-to-interpret report.
“This panel boosts lab efficiency by replacing cumbersome methods involving capillary electrophoresis and analysis” said Peter Dansky, Chief Executive Officer of Agena. “The simplified workflow and automated reporting reduce the burden on specialized staff and allow results to be calculated much faster than traditional methods.”
The announcement was made during the Association for Molecular Pathology annual meeting in San Antonio, TX.
“is the perfect venue for this discussion” said Dr. Darryl Irwin, Senior Director of Scientific Affairs for following an industry workshop highlighting the panel. “Molecular laboratories are being asked to process increasing numbers of samples using a time-consuming method run on a platform with limited utility. This panel simplifies bone marrow engraftment studies that monitor chimerism and gives labs access to other Massapplications such as cancer profiling for liquid biopsies and pharmacogenetics to name a few.”
About develops, manufactures, and supplies genetic analysis systems and reagents, including the MassARRAY® System. The system is a highly sensitive, cost-effective, mass spectrometry-based platform for high-throughput genetic analysis, and is used globally in diverse research fields such as cancer profiling for solid tumors and liquid biopsies, inherited genetic disease testing, pharmacogenetics, agricultural genomics, and clinical research.
