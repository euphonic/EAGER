We aim to harmoniously coexist with society by striving to engage in corporate citizenship activities in all areas where we conduct business.
To Bring Smiles to Those Close to Us
The first step to creating a better society lies in the feelings we have for those close to us.
The more that people who share the same ambitions work together, the closer we get to realizing such a society.
If we see someone in trouble, or someone putting forth their best effort, will raise its voice in support.
wishes to form connections with people and society at large so that a peaceful coexistence can be realized.
understands that the simple action of caring for other people can become the driving force for significant social change.

As a good corporate citizen, is working to contribute to the sustainable development of society.
To this end, is actively promoting corporate citizenship activities that are deeply rooted in local communities as it aims to become a company that is trusted and understood by society as a whole.
DENSO’s corporate citizenship activities Activity Policy and Key Points
In fiscal 2006, we formulated the Group Basic Policy for Corporate Citizenship Activities. Guided by this policy, we are promoting activities in the three priority areas of “harmony with the environment,” “ensuring security and safety in communities,” and “Hitozukuri ” (developing youth and supporting differently abled persons), all of which represent areas in which we can leverage our unique strengths. As we pursue these activities, we take into account the social circumstances of each individual region.
DENSO’s corporate citizenship activities Creating a Corporate Culture That Encourages Employees to Volunteer
We have set up an employee volunteer support program to help employees who wish to participate in volunteer activities find opportunities to do so. At the same time, we are working to create a corporate culture that encourages employees to get involved in corporate citizenship activities on their own initiative.
DENSO’s corporate citizenship activities Collaboration with Local Communities and Group Companies
Turning our eyes to the social issues faced by Japan and communities all over the world, we are collaborating with Group companies and local communities to pursue corporate citizenship activities that cater to the social circumstances in each country and region of operation.

Technical cooperation with Robert Bosch Gmbof Germany is started.
The agreement allowed us to expand our technical expertise from outside the company to achieve world-class engineering.
1954
By establishing service plants in respective regions, the Assigned Service Station System is started.
Today, a global service network of around 4,600 bases is in place to enhance services for end users in different regions (e.g. repair and replacement of our products).
Our Technical Training Center is established.
The principles of "Monozukuri is Hitozukuri (our performance relies on our people)" and "engineering and technique, hand in hand" are still being practiced today.
1955
The Injection Pump Preparation Section is established.
We began to expand our business fields beyond the development and production of electrical components we established at the time of our founding. Today, we operate in various product areas such as powertrain, thermal systems, electronics, and driving control & safety systems. We have a competitive edge in being able to deliver entire systems instead of single products.
1961
The Deming Prize, the most prestigious award for quality control, is received.
Efforts made by all employees to win the prize laid the foundations for the concept and our culture of "Quality First."

Manufacturing
Innovative products and components can only be realized if they can be manufactured. At DENSO, our technicians and engineers painstakingly refine every detail of our manufacturing systems to enable the creation of the best technologies and products. 
WorldSkills Competition medalists
Our commitment to the production of world-class components requires constant refinement of our evaluation equipment and processing methods. This is where highly skilled technicians play a vital role. Recognizing the importance of both technologies and skills, we built our skill development center in 1954, only five years after our establishment. Today, has earned 63 WorldSkills Competition medals, and the medalist partner with our engineers to bring our products from prototype to production.
Meticulous quality control
focuses on safety because cars carry people. We were one of the first parts manufacturers to build our own test courses to evaluate our products, ensuring that people could confidently drive cars using our components. Our advanced test facilities are comparable with those of major carmakers and include such advances as high-low temperature wind tunnel laboratories and anechoic chambers that simulate the diverse conditions drivers encounter every day.
Creating exotic new materials
When existing materials don’t provide the properties we need, we create new materials. This is what makes monozukuri — the art of making things — so unique. Our material engineers collaborate with material makers to develop new materials that contribute to the creation of world-first products offering leading performance.
Where world firsts take shape
is an innovator in highly precise processing and assembly. We develop our own facilities, machines and production lines that bring world-first products and unparalleled performance and quality to market.
