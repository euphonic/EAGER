Our Strengths
will prepare a brighter future for generations to come through our commitment to protecting lives and preserving the planet. We believe the unique strengths of our research, production and people make anything possible.
Research & Development
produces world-first technologies and products that increase security and safety while lowering environmental impact through our commitment to groundbreaking research and development.
Solid technological partnerships
supplies technologies and products to all major automakers. Our experience in developing state-of-the-art technologies in wide-ranging fields helps us find unique solutions to end users’ needs.
The pursuit of world firsts
is committed to creating technologies that contribute to a better quality of life for all people. Our world-first advances range from common rail systems that dramatically improve diesel engine performance to night view technology that detects pedestrians at night.
Shaping our future
has short-term (five year), mid-term (10 year) and long-term (20 year) roadmaps for technological research. At our institute for long-term research, we use our state-of-the-art facilities and technologies to research everything from semiconductor materials to microalgae that produce oil.
Worldwide R&network
At DENSO’s technical centers around the world (Japan, U.S., Germany, Brazil, India, China and Thailand), we collaborate with automakers, research institutes and universities to develop leading technologies and products that meet local needs.

Manufacturing
Innovative products and components can only be realized if they can be manufactured. At DENSO, our technicians and engineers painstakingly refine every detail of our manufacturing systems to enable the creation of the best technologies and products. 
WorldSkills Competition medalists
Our commitment to the production of world-class components requires constant refinement of our evaluation equipment and processing methods. This is where highly skilled technicians play a vital role. Recognizing the importance of both technologies and skills, we built our skill development center in 1954, only five years after our establishment. Today, has earned 63 WorldSkills Competition medals, and the medalist partner with our engineers to bring our products from prototype to production.
Meticulous quality control
focuses on safety because cars carry people. We were one of the first parts manufacturers to build our own test courses to evaluate our products, ensuring that people could confidently drive cars using our components. Our advanced test facilities are comparable with those of major carmakers and include such advances as high-low temperature wind tunnel laboratories and anechoic chambers that simulate the diverse conditions drivers encounter every day.
Creating exotic new materials
When existing materials don’t provide the properties we need, we create new materials. This is what makes monozukuri — the art of making things — so unique. Our material engineers collaborate with material makers to develop new materials that contribute to the creation of world-first products offering leading performance.
Where world firsts take shape
is an innovator in highly precise processing and assembly. We develop our own facilities, machines and production lines that bring world-first products and unparalleled performance and quality to market.
