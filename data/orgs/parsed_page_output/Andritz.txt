The cornerstone of today’s international technology Group was laid in 1852 when a small iron foundry was set up in Graz, Austria.
The milestones in the history of are outlined here.
1852-1900: beginnings as an iron foundry
has its origins in an iron foundry that was established in 1852 by the Hungarian entrepreneur Josef Körösi in Andritz, a suburb of the city of Graz. Soon after its foundation, the company’s production program was extended to include large capital goods, such as cranes, pumps, water turbines, and later also bridges, steam boilers and engines, as well as mining equipment.
In 1852, the Hungarian Josef Körösi established an iron foundry in Andritz, a suburb of the city of Graz, Austria.
1900: becomes a stock corporation
1900-1946: World Wars and the Great Depression
At the end of the First and Second World Wars and during the Great Depression in the early 1930s, ANDRITZ’s production came to a standstill, but the company’s dedicated management and employees succeeded each time in making a new start.
1946-1980: growth and new products
In 1949, began a lasting cooperation with the Escher Wyss Group of Switzerland, initially in the water turbines sector. The product portfolio of was revised: Production of steam engines and air compressors came to an end, and the focus shifted towards water turbines, centrifugal pumps, cranes, and steel structures. In 1951, embarked on the production of complete paper machines in cooperation with Escher Wyss.
In 1950, Creditanstalt-Bankverein, Austria, acquired a majority interest in ANDRITZ.
During the 1960s and 1970s, continued to grow. The production shops were extended, new machines purchased, and research and development activities intensified. Electrochemical and metallurgical equipment were added to the production program.
The site in Graz in the mid 1950ies.
1980s: crisis and recovery
The second global oil crisis and worldwide economic stagnation in the early 1980s caused a drop in ANDRITZ’s order intake and the company was operating at a loss, but Austrian government subsidies and drastic rationalization measures enabled the company to survive.
In 1987, AG, an investment company in Frankfurt, Germany, acquired a majority stake in began to change its strategic direction, from being a licensee of other equipment manufacturers to become a leading international supplier of its own high-tech production systems.
1999: change of ownership
sold its shareholding in to a consortium of investment companies (The Carlyle Group, Capital, Unternehmensinvest AG, Deutsche Beteiligungs AG) and the Custos private foundation (established by Wolfgang Leitner, President and of ANDRITZ).

Growth through acquisitions and research & development
In 1990, the acquisition of Sprout-Bauer, a company supplying equipment for mechanical pulp and animal feed production, marked the beginning of the Group’s successful expansion policy through acquisitions. Complementary acquisitions, in addition to organic growth that is mainly driven by research and development, have been an important driver of company growth ever since.
S1990, has acquired and integrated almost 70 companies, pursuing its policy of complementary acquisitions. The largest transactions in terms of sales were the acquisitions of Ahlstrom Machinery Group in 2000/2001 (making a globally leading supplier of pulp production systems), of in 2006 (advancing to a globally leading supplier of electromechanical equipment for hydropower plants), and of more than 95% of Schuler, the world market leader in forming technology, in 2013.

Every day, more than 7,000 employees are working hands-on in 70 manufacturing and service locations worldwide to produce custom-tailored key components as well as wear and spare parts to suit individual customer requirements for systems and equipment.
Around two-thirds of the manufacturing staff work in Europe and North America, and one-third in the emerging countries of Asia, South America, and Eastern Europe. They are assisted by trained temporary staff.
manufacturing focuses particularly on the production of key components critical to technology and quality. Everything else is largely purchased from qualified suppliers who are subjected to regular quality checks and on-time performance monitoring. With this proven make-or-buy strategy, it is easier to deal with changes in capacity utilization and ensure optimum use of own manufacturing capacities.
All manufacturing locations undergo continuous further development so that they can offer customers the best possible technologies. Investments concentrate on building up and expanding manufacturing capacities in the emerging countries of Asia and South America, as well as in Central and Eastern Europe on the one hand, and on modernizing existing locations in Central Europe and North America on the other.

Involving the R&staff directly in project development, preparation of quotations, and project execution is also an essential factor for economic success. Customers and consulting engineers can access the R&know-how directly and, at the same time, current market developments flow straight into development projects.
The research and development sector at is also closely linked to an international network of research partners. Research projects with universities working on the relevant technologies are actively pursued and supported. In many cases, basic research is conducted that cannot always be pursued to an adequate extent in
the course of project-related everyday business. Another advantage of these collaborations is the contact to highly qualified graduates who are well prepared to take on future tasks within the company. Many university students sponsored by decide to take up employment with the company after graduating.

In the education and training sectors, a management training program for the next generation of managers has been in place for several years. Courses are available on an international and a local level covering many different topics. The company's collaboration with universities is particularly important. Another element of ANDRITZ's success is the commitment of its employees, who are encouraged to make use of their personal knowledge and experience in their work. Integrating the companies that it acquires presents a big challenge for ANDRITZ, in particular when it comes to assimilating new employees. The Group also takes measures to help its employees achieve a good work-life balance and invests heavily in health and safety at work.
Globalization promotes economic growth, both in industrial countries and in emerging markets. Companies like ANDRITZ, which focus on sustainability, do business in free, open markets and in countries that aim to distribute wealth equally among their citizens.

Supplier Code of Conduct
In order to broaden the scope of the Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, a Supplier Code of Conduct was published in 2015, defining the minimum requirements for sub-suppliers collaborating with the This is a fixed element of any contract and must be signed by suppliers as a sign of their assent and then returned. The content of the Supplier Code of Conduct was also added to all contracts that already existed before the Code was published and the contracts were updated accordingly.
In addition to organizational requirements and anchoring the compliance topic within the respective organization, the Code also contains certain requirements relating to human rights and working conditions, responsibility for the environment, integrity in business dealings, export controls, and handling data from third parties. Suppliers are instructed to report any breaches of the Code to without delay. Depending on the severity of the violation, the measures implemented may go as far as ending the business relationship. In future, online training is to be provided.
The questionnaire used for supplier assessment was also extended on the basis of the Supplier Code of Conduct to cover the topics of compliance and sustainability. It must be completed by all existing and newly qualified suppliers. If the replies are not satisfactory, the Supplier Compliance and Sustainability department will draw up a catalog of measures together with the respective supplier to ensure compliance with the Code.
Another step towards a better and more comprehensive assessment of suppliers in terms of sustainability and compliance is the appointment of auditors – two for the time being – who will operate in India and Asia. The local supply chain will be reviewed in terms of human rights and fair working conditions,environmental responsibility, business integrity, export controls, and intellectual property rights in coordination with the Quality Group Function in these two regions; event-driven audits are triggered by defined risk parameters.
