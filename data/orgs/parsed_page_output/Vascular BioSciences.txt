About VBS
(VBS) is a biopharmaceutical and medical device company with operations in California and North Carolina with a focus on developing solutions for difficult-to-treat cardioand inflammatory diseases – the leading cause of serious illness and death in industrialized countries. At VBS, we are focusing on intrinsic causes and mechanisms of disease in order to lay the foundation for a robust array of next generation targeted pharmaceuticals, interventional devices and personalized molecular diagnostics.
Our lead therapeutic candidate, (CAR) peptide, represents a new paradigm in targeted therapy. preferentially homes to, and penetrates, diseased tissue while selectively augmenting the efficacy of therapies and accelerating wound healing. can selectively enhance gene therapy, boost drug effectiveness, and reduce systemic side effects by enhancing the efficacy of co-administered therapeutics.
Our efforts to find better solutions for treating vascular-based diseases has resulted in the world’s first and only method of endoarterial biopsy sampling that does not require invasive surgery. Furthermore, when endoarterial biopsies are combined with our molecular diagnostic techniques, a new age in disease detection and treatment is made possible, one in which the molecular signatures underlying each patient’s disease can be identified and therapeutics can be prescribed to precisely target each patient’s individual disease pathways.
