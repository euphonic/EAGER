We believe.

	    						    					At GlucanBio, we know natural resources are precious. And using available natural resources like biomass, as efficiently as possible, is a global game-changer. That’s why we are developing a scalable, cost-efficient technology – to lead the change.
We know what to do.

	    						    					We’re not taking the typical approach; we’re focused on bio-chemicals and we’re discovering new market opportunities in addition to the existing drop-in furfural market. We’ll travel the globe to convert biomass to renewable chemicals, cost effectively.	    				
We’re ready to do it.

	    						    					North America is the ideal place to launch a commercial plant to prove our platform.  We’re exploring multiple locations and forming strategic partnerships to make it happen.

GlucanBio was founded in 2012, based on technology developed from the University of Wisconsin and Center for Biorenewable Chemicals (CBiRC) at Iowa State. Our primary purpose is to produce furan derivatives from biomass with cost and performance advantages. The market opportunity is strong and relevant, not only for furfural, but also for HMF, DMF, and FDCA.Our team offers best-in-field expertise in catalysis, management, engineering scale-up, and early stage commercialization.Engaging great minds like Jim Dumesic, a world-renowned catalytic chemist, and Brent Shanks, a highly acclaimed principal in the industry, gives us an advantage in hurdling technical roadblocks.
