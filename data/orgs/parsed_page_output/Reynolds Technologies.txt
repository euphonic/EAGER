In 1897, Alfred solved a problem that had frustrated cycle frame builders for many years. 
By thickening the walls at the end of the tubes, Alfred had discovered a technique that would revolutionise cycle frame engineering to the present day.
lot has happened in the last 120 years and many milestones have been achieved; by our engineers, our clients and their riders. Not least 27 Tour de France winners.
In 2018, our butted steel tubing technology remains the product of choice for high-performance cycle manufacturers, including De Rosa, Genesis, Mercian and LeMond, to name but a few.
Innovation is the driver behind everything we do. Together with our clients, we’re continually improving the performance of cycling and cyclists – from club level to pro-team.
The next phase of our journey is going to be the most exciting yet – we hope you’ll join us on it.
