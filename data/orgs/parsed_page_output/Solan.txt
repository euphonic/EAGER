18. WAIVER
Please read this section carefully. It affects your rights.
Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to a customer’s satisfaction by contacting us at corehelp@salon.com. This Provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and Salon. Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision. You have the right to opt-out of this Provision (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury.
Please read this Provision carefully. It provides that all Disputes between you and Salon shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Except as otherwise provided, entering into this agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees).
For the purpose of this Provision, the “Salon” means Salon and its parents, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Salon regarding any aspect of your relationship with Salon, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as Salon’s licensors, suppliers, dealers or third party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.
THAT, BELOW, DISPUTES, ABOVE, FUTURE, PROVISION.
Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution
For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give Salon an opportunity to resolve the Dispute. You must commence this process by mailing written notification to Salon Media Group, Inc., 101 Spear Street, Suite 203, San Francisco, 94105. That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your Claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek. If Salon does not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below.
Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out
Notwithstanding the above, you or Salon may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) the Dispute qualifies, it may be initiated in small claims court; or (b) OPT-30 (the “Opt-Out Deadline”). You may opt out of this Provision by mailing written notification Salon Media Group, Inc., 101 Spear Street, Suite 203, San Francisco, 94105. Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Salon through arbitration. Your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Salon. Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court.
Arbitration Procedures
If this Provision applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or Salon may initiate arbitration proceedings. The arbitration will be conducted under the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures ("Rules") in effect on the date of commencement of the arbitration, as modified by these The arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator. The arbitration will be based entirely on the written submissions of the parties and documents submitted to the arbitrator, unless the parties agree or the arbitrator orders otherwise. Unless you and Salon both agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not join your claim(s) or Salon's claim(s) with any other claim, and may not preside over any representative or class proceedings.
Because the Service and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit.
Arbitration Award – The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement.
Location of Arbitration – You or Salon may initiate arbitration in either San Francisco, California or the federal judicial district that includes your billing address. In the event that you select the federal judicial district that includes your billing address, Salon may transfer the arbitration to San Francisco, California in the event that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the transfer, as determined by the arbitrator.
Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs – For any arbitration in which you claim less than $10,000, Salon will reimburse you for the cost of your filing fee with and will directly pay all of JAMS' other costs and fees. For claims between $10,000 and $75,000, you will pay any filing fee required by JAMS, and Salon will pay all of JAMS' other costs and fees. If you bring claims between $10,000 and $75,000 and the arbitrator determines that you cannot afford to pay the filing fee, Salon will pay the fee directly on your behalf. If, however, the arbitrator determines that any claim brought by you is frivolous, then payment of JAMS' costs and fees will be governed by the rules. Furthermore, if the arbitrator determines that your claims are frivolous, you agree to reimburse Salon for any costs or fees that it paid that otherwise would have been your responsibility under the Rules. If you bring a claim for greater than $75,000, payment of fees and other costs to will be governed by the Rules. In addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with Salon as provided in the section above titled “Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution” and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator.
Class Action Waiver
Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and Salon specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration. If you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other user of the Service can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above.
Severability
If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision, and the remainder of this Provision will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court.
Survival
This Provision shall survive the termination of your service with Salon or its affiliates. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, you and Salon agree that if Salon makes any change to this Provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change and require Salon to adhere to the language in this Provision if a dispute between us arises.
19. WAIVER
No modification or amendment to nor waiver of any part of this Agreement shall be of any force or effect unless formally posted by Salon as part of these TOS, or made in writing and signed by a duly authorized officer of Salon.
20. SEVERABILITY
If any provision of this Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable, the provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in force.
21. AGREEMENT
This Agreement, the Privacy Policy, and any other terms and conditions of service for specific services or features of the Site constitute the entire agreement between you and Salon and govern your use of the Site.

Last Revised May 24, 2018.
We respect your privacy, and we want you to know how we use the information you provide to us. This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) applies to your use of our website located at www.salon.com, as well as to all other online websites (collectively, the “Site”) and mobile applications (the “Application”), blogs and interactive applications operated by Salon Media Group Inc. (“Salon,” “us” or “we”), collectively our “Services,” unless a different policy is provided on a particular website or application. In this Privacy Policy, we describe the information we collect, how Salon uses and discloses the information, and your choices regarding our information collection practices.
Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. By visiting our Site and Application and using our Services, you agree that your information, including your personal information, will be handled as described in this Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference into this Terms of Service.
Information We Collect
We collect information from and about you, including personal information and information about your use of the Site, the Application, and our Services. Specifically, we collect information: (1) directly from you, such as when you register to use our Site, request our newsletter, or participate in contests, sweepstakes, or other offers; (2) from third parties, such as when you log in through a social networking site or our Refer a Friend program; and (3) automatically, as you move through our Site and our Application, such as Site usage, browser types, addresses or device IDs, and other data, as discussed below.
Information We Collect Directly From You. We request information from you when you register for an account for our Site (our legacy “Salon Core” members), request our newsletter, participate in our contests, sweepstakes, and other promotions, and contact us. Depending upon the particular activity, we may request the following information from you: your name, email address, zip code, gender, age range, income range, username, password, and, for Salon Core members, credit card information.
Information We Collect About You From Third Parties.
Refer a Friend. The Site offers an “email a friend about this story” feature, allowing Site visitors to send email to friends to inform them about an article that might be of interest. For this feature to function, we ask for email addresses for the recipient (so we know who to mail the message to) and from the sender (so we can tell the recipient who sent the email). We do not store or save these addresses and neither you nor your friend will receive email or other communications from Salon or its partners as a result of having used this feature. While this tool should not be used to send mass “spam” mailings, Salon has no control over how our visitors use it, and any email sent through it originates with, and is the responsibility of, the sender, not Salon.
Social Networking Sites. You may log onto our Site through social networking applications, such as Facebook and Twitter. From time to time, we may add the capability to log into our Site through different social networking sites. If you log into our Services through a social networking site, we will request your name and certain basic information. We also may request certain permissions from you, which vary based on the social networking site. For information about how the particular social networking site may disclose your information, including any information you make public, please consult their privacy policy. We have no control over how a third party social networking site uses or discloses the personal information that you provide to it. We store the information that we receive from the social networking site along with other information that we collect from you or receive about you.
Information We Collect Automatically. We use cookies, web beacons, Flash, and other automated devices to collect information about you when you visit our Site and our Application. Specifically, we collect the following information about your use of our Site via these technologies: your browser type and operating system; web pages you view; links you click; your address; your interaction with the Site; length of time you are logged in to our Site; and websites visited before our Site.
With regard to the Application, we may collect your mobile device ID; location and language information; device name and model; operating system type, name and version; your activities within the Application; and the length of time that you are logged into our Application. We will request your information before we collect your location.
Please see the section “Use of Cookies, Flash Cookies, HTML5, Web Beacons, and Other Tracking Devices” below for more information about our use of these tracking devices. We may use the information gathered through these methods in anonymous or aggregated form to analyze ways to improve our Services. This information may be associated with your username and may be combined with other information, including personal information that we collect about you.
Location Information. If you are using our Application, we also may collect your location. We will request your permission prior to doing so. We may combine your location information with other information that we have collected about you.
Use of Cookies, Flash Cookies, HTML5, Web Beacons, and Other Tracking Devices
When you interact with our Services, we strive to make your experience easy and meaningful. We or our third party service providers use cookies, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs, and similar technologies to track user activity and collect data about our Site, Services, and our users. As stated above, we may combine this data with the personal information we have collected from or about you.
Cookies. We use browser “cookies” on our Site. Cookies are a website’s way of remembering who you are. cookie is a small text file that is stored on your computer’s hard drive or stored temporarily in your computer’s memory. There are two kinds of cookies, and we use both types of cookies on our Site: “session” cookies and “persistent” cookies. Session cookies are deleted when you close your browser. Persistent cookies remain on your computer and retain information for later use tomorrow, next month or whenever they are set to expire. We use cookies to help us to identify account holders and to optimize their experience on our Site. Also, we will use cookies to monitor and maintain information about your use of this Site.
Most Web browsers accept cookies automatically. You can delete cookies manually or set your browser to automatically delete cookies on a pre-determined schedule. If you decline to accept cookies, you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in certain features of this Site.
Other companies that place advertising on our Site also have the ability to assign their cookies to you. You can opt out of the collection of certain information about you by many online advertisers. Please see the section below entitled “Advertising” for additional information.
Use of Flash Cookies and HTML5. Our Services enable the use of the Adobe Flash Player. Your use of the Adobe Flash Player generates “flash cookies” (also known as “persistent identification elements” or “local shared objects”). The Adobe Flash Player (and similar applications) uses flash cookies to remember user settings, preferences and usage in a manner similar to the browser cookies referenced above. Flash cookies can store more information than browser cookies and are managed through a different interface than the one provided by your Web browser.
You can control the degree to which you accept flash cookies by accessing your Adobe Flash Player management tools directly through the settings manager for Adobe Flash, located at http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html. (Users running the Windows operating system can generally view flash cookie files in this folder: \Documents and Settings\[username]\Application Data\Macromedia\Flash Player. Users running the Apple operating system can generally view flash cookie files in this folder: /users/[username]/Library/Preferences/macromedia/Flash Player. Flash cookies, or files are stored typically with an “.SOL” extension. If you do not allow flash cookies on your computer, you may not be able to take advantage of or participate in certain features of our Services.
is the software language used for building most of the sites on the internet. Some HTML5 code may allow your responses to advertising and other activities to be monitored across websites, and for such information to be stored on your computer or mobile device and accessed by others you do or have done business with. Salon accesses user activity information stored through this feature of HTML5. As with cookies, other companies that place advertising on our Site may have the ability to access information using this feature of HTML5. Salon does not control and is not responsible for any such access or for their use of information obtained.
Web Beacons. Our Web pages or e-mail messages may contain a small graphic image called a Web beacon, which is sometimes also called a “clear gif,” that allows us to monitor and collect certain information about our users, such as the type of browser requesting the Web beacon, the address of the computer that the Web beacon is sent to and the time the Web beacon was viewed. Web beacons can be very small or invisible to the user, but, in general, any electronic image viewed as part of a Web page or email, including HTML-based content, can act as a Web beacon. We may use Web beacons to count visitors to our Web pages or to monitor how our users navigate our Site, and we may include Web beacons in email messages in order to count how many of the messages we sent were actually opened or acted upon. We use Web beacons to compile aggregate statistics about our Site and our marketing campaigns.
Analytics. Each time a visitor comes to the Site or uses our Application, our servers collect information, including, for example, the visitor’s domain name (e.g., the website that you came from), referral data (e.g., depending on your browser, the address of the last page or series of pages you visited prior to clicking through to our Site), and browser and platform type. We also count, track and aggregate each visitor’s activity as part of our analysis of general traffic flows at our Site and on our Application (e.g., tracking where traffic comes from, how traffic flows within the Site and our Application, etc.). We collect some of this data directly, and we also engage third party service providers (e.g., Google Analytics) who use the technologies described in this section, to collect this information and to assist us with our analytics.
Security of Information
Salon makes efforts to protect your information. However, no website, Internet transmission, computer system or wireless connection is completely secure. Salon cannot guarantee that unauthorized access or disclosure, hacking, data loss or other breaches will not occur. Your use of the Site and our Services is at your own risk. Salon urges you to take steps to keep your information safe by memorizing your password or keeping it in a safe place (separate from your account information), logging out of your account, and closing your Web browser. In addition, you should not provide your password to others. By registering for or using our Services, you are responsible for any use of the our Services accomplished through the use of your password.

Affiliates and Non-Affiliated Third Parties. We may disclose your information to affiliates and non-affiliated companies when we believe their products or services may be of interest to you, so that they can contact you with offers. If you are a California resident, you have a right to obtain information about this sharing; please see the Special Notice to California Consumers below. If you respond to an offer and provide information directly to another company, that information will be subject to their privacy policy, not this Privacy Policy. If you later decide that you do not want that third party to use your information, you will need to contact the third party directly. Salon is not responsible for the manner in which other businesses collect or use your personal information.
Joint Marketing Events/Partners. We also may partner with third parties for joint marketing events. If you participate in such as an event, including a promotion as discussed below, we may share your information with the third party.
Third parties providing services on our behalf. We may engage third parties to perform services in connection with the operation of our business. Examples of these services include: (a) distribution of marketing and promotional material; (b) website evaluation and analytics; (c) fulfilling magazine, newsletter or other subscriptions; (d) data collection, storage, management, analysis and, where applicable, cleansing, and (e) any other services designed to assist us in maximizing our business potential.

We may release information about you when legally required to do so, at the request of governmental authorities conducting an investigation, in response to a subpoena or other legal process, or to verify or enforce compliance with the policies governing our Site, Application, and applicable laws. We may also disclose such user information whenever we believe disclosure is necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of Salon, or any of our respective affiliates, business partners, customers or others.
Aggregate Information. We may disclose aggregated user statistics to third parties for a variety of purposes, including describing our services to prospective partners and other third parties, such as advertisers, and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy.

Certain portions of our Services permit registered users to post content, including, for example, commenting on an article, posting a picture, etc. Any information that you post to our Services may be viewable by other visitors to our Services.

We cannot prevent such information from being used in a manner that may violate this Policy, the law or your personal privacy.
Advertising
We use third parties such as network advertisers to serve advertisements on our Site. Network advertisers are third parties that display advertisements based on the use of personal information as already described in this privacy policy as well as your visits to our Site and other websites you have visited.
This enables us and these third parties to personalize and target advertisements to you for products and services in which you might be interested. Third party ad network providers, advertisers, sponsors and/or traffic measurement services may use cookies, JavaScript, web beacons (including clear GIFs), Flash LSOs and other technologies to measure the effectiveness of their ads and to personalize advertising content to you.
These third party cookies and other technologies are governed by each third party’s specific privacy policy, not this one. We may provide these third-party advertisers with information about your usage of our Site and our Services on an aggregated basis.
You may opt-out of many third-party ad networks. The website http://www.networkadvertising.org/optout_nonppii.asp provides information regarding this practice by Network Advertising Initiative (“NAI”) members, and your choices regarding having this information used by these companies, including how to “opt-out” of third-party ad networks operated by members.
You also may contact the Digital Advertising Alliance at http://www.aboutads.info/choices/ for information about opting out of targeted advertising and your choices regarding having information used by About Ads member companies, including how to “opt-out” of third-party ad networks operated by About Ads members. Opting out of one or more members or members (many of which will be the same) only means that those members no longer will deliver targeted content or ads to you, but it does not mean you will no longer receive any targeted content or ads on our Site or other websites. You may continue to receive advertisements, for example, based on the particular website that you are viewing. Also, if your browsers are configured to reject cookies when you visit this opt-out page, or you subsequently erase your cookies, use a different computer or change web browsers, your or opt-out may no longer, be effective. Additional information is available on NAI’s and DAI’s websites accessible by the above links.
Special Information for California Consumers
California residents may request a list of all third parties to which Salon has disclosed certain personal information about you for the third party’s marketing purposes. You may make one request per calendar year. In your request, please attest that you are a California resident and provide a current California address for our response to you.

When we amend this Privacy Policy, we will revise the “last updated” date located at the top of this Privacy Policy.

Farmers' dilemma: Save bees or save themselves
Saving the bee is one of the most pressing challenges facing agriculture today
The original article appears on WhoWhoWhy.org .
Saving the bee — an indispensable pollinator for many crops — is one of the most pressing challenges facing agriculture today. Yet farmers are being paid government subsidies to plant crops in ways that are harmful to bees. Many farmers have to decide whether they want to reverse the decline of bee populations through sustainable practices, or risk devastating their own livelihoods — and the future of some major food crops — through the pursuit of short-term profits.
Behind this ongoing crisis in agriculture looms the specter of climate change.

The key to avoiding mass extinction of species like the honey bee and preventing ecosystem collapse — suggests a Berkeley  study  — may be enhancing biodiversity in working lands: farmland, rangeland, and forests.
“Sustainability is a real issue, and in order to create systems that are truly sustainable, it’s important to take care of the biodiversity that provides critical ecological services underlying sustainability,” Dr. Claire Kremen — co-author of the study, and a professor at Berkeley’s Department of Environmental Sciences, Policy, and Management — told WhoWhatWhy.
Promoting diversity on working lands could be as simple as adding trees, hedgerows, or different flowering plants along the edges of fields, or as complex as using crop rotations and keeping livestock on a single farm.
Farms that grow only a single crop remove biodiversity from vast amounts of land; the process degrades habitats for bees and other organisms. One sustainable practice that could make a big difference is the use of  cover crops , which help to improve soil quality and enhance wildlife and pollinator habitat.
Many pollinators are  habitat-specific , and much pollinator habitat has been lost to agriculture, resource extraction, and urban and suburban development. Cover crops, like clover and alfalfa, provide highly nutritious  food  for bees.
While beekeepers in the United States have been attempting to  stabilize  the number of honeybee colonies, it’s not a permanent solution. There are not enough habitats to allow bees to survive without the help of beekeepers.
“It’s much more difficult to keep honey bees now than in the past. Beekeepers are having to work harder,” Dr. Claudia Hitaj, economist for the Conservation and Environment Branch at the Economic Research Service, told WhoWhatWhy. They often must move their honey bees around the country to service pollination contracts and secure good access to forage during summer.
“ Research  shows that moving colonies frequently or over great distances can decrease the lifespan of honey bees,” Hitaj said.

“Several fruit and vegetable farmers interviewed for my book were struggling to get their crops pollinated,” Brian DeVore, agricultural journalist and author of " Wildly Successful Farming: Sustainability and the New Agricultural Land Ethic ," told WhoWhatWhy. “One farmer planted native prairie around their vegetable plots, and after a few years the plots were thriving with pollinators. But prairie seed is very expensive and difficult to establish.”
“Sustainability practices are hard work, and our marketplace does not support it,” DeVore said. “For example, if you’re going to plant cover crops, then, yes, it’s something you’re going to need to invest in.”
Crop farmers across Indiana have been among the first to experience benefits from sustainable farming practices, though for  many  it’s difficult to estimate how well those practices have paid off.
Corn farmer Dan DeSutter estimated in 2016 that all his sustainable practices increased the income from his corn crop by about one-third, compared to the county average.

Another example of sustainable crop-farming success is that of corn/soybean farmer Rodney Rulon. Using a combination of nutrient management, cover crops, and other conservation practices, he has improved his soil health and has seen a net return on his investment in sustainability of more than  320  percent .
However, current policy pays farmers commodities to plant and grow certain kinds of crops in specific regions, and farmers often rely on government subsidies to stay in business.
Some government programs, such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP), do cover costs that farmers face when starting sustainability practices on their land. Generally around  50 to 75 percent  of costs are covered; these involve planning, design, materials, implementation, management, labor, and/or maintenance.
But even with the help of programs like EQIP, DeVore said, “it could take the average farmer three to five years for a return on investment when utilizing a soil building technique like cover-cropping.”
“However, ranches with livestock can see substantial return on investments when adopting  sustainability practices,” Kremen said. By increasing the variety of trees, shrubs, and grasses in some pastures, she said, cows produced four or five times as much milk, and needed far less grazing land to produce a ton of meat.

Issues such as lack of habitat and climate change continue to be major environmental stressors on honeybee populations.
“One of the last refuges for good forage, that is also pesticide-free, are the Prairie Fields in North Dakota, and even that is changing,” Hitaj explained.
Restoring habitats in and around working lands would allow for habitat “permeability,” says Adina Merenlender, a cooperative extension specialist in the Department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management at Berkeley. “This is even more true in the face of climate change, because species will need to move around to adapt to shifts in temperature and climate.”
Maintaining even small pieces of the original landscape — even a single tree — can help conserve the original diversity of species.
“strong movement within the conservation community is working to protect 50 percent of terrestrial habitat area. But that is a tall order compared to current global goals at 17 percent,” stated Kremen.
Advertisement:
While sustainability practices benefit biodiversity, more widespread use of them across the is needed to meet environmentalist goals — but so far there are not powerful enough incentives for farmers to do so en masse, profitably.
“It is possible for these working landscapes to support biodiversity but also be productive and profitable,” Kremen argues. “And ultimately, this is where we have to go. We just can’t keep mining our soils for their fertility and polluting our streams — in the end, this will diminish our capacity to continue producing the food that we need. Instead, we must pay attention to the species, from microbes to mammals, that supply us with critical services, like pollination, pest control and nutrient cycling.”

The best chicken breast recipe you've never heard of
mashup of a breaded chicken cutlet and an extra-crispy latke
December 2, 2018 7:59(UTC)
This story first appeared on  Food52 , an online community that gives you everything you need for a happier kitchen and home – that means tested recipes, a shop full of beautiful products, a cooking hotline, and everything in between!
The Hanukkah story goes something like this: tyrannical ruler was oppressing the Jews. So they rebelled, fought for their freedom, and finally won. After reclaiming a temple in Jerusalem, they lit a menorah to celebrate. There was only enough oil to burn for one day, but by some miracle, it lasted for eight.
Though the historical accuracy of this is up for debate , it’s still the tale that’s been told from generation to generation for thousands of years. It’s the reason why Hanukkah lasts for eight days. And it’s the reason why Hanukkah revolves around one type of food: fried. In places like Israel , this means lots of sufganiyot, or jelly-filled doughnuts. Meanwhile, in places like the United States , it’s all about latkes, or potato pancakes.
Advertisement:
Not that I’m biased or anything, but my mom makes the best latkes — always served with applesauce and sour cream because no one should have to pick. She coarsely shreds the potatoes and onions, wring-dries both, binds it all together with just enough egg and flour, and salts everything like there’s no tomorrow. When they fry up in the oil, their edges turn frizzy, and their exteriors get as crunchy as a potato chip.
But our Hanukkahs weren’t about the latkes. My brother and begged for those plenty, but we begged for something else even more: latke chicken. Or, as we would put it, “Latke chicken!!!!!!” It’s a breaded chicken cutlet, only instead of being coated in breadcrumbs, it’s coated in that same latke mixture described above.
My mom has no clue where she got this idea. She thought it might’ve come from one of her best friends, but her best friend said, Nope, not me. And from there, it’s a downright mystery. Google search for latke chicken led me to this blog post , a dopplegänger concept, but over a decade too late to have inspired my mom. Plus, this curious chicken latke (not latke chicken, get it?), where shredded chicken is mixed into the potato pancake. And these chicken fat–fried latkes from The New York Times.
That last one got me thinking. As Melissa Clark writes, “Frying latkes in schmaltz — rendered poultry fat — is the traditional Ashkenazi method, what Central and Eastern European Jews typically did before assimilating in America.” Which is to say, chicken is special in Jewish cooking—especially during Hanukkah, when a roast chicken and just-fried latkes are like two peas in a pod.
It was really only a matter of time before someone combined the two. Whether it was my mom’s ah-ha moment on an extra-busy weeknight or an idea she snagged from somewhere (any idea where? Do share in the comments!) it’s been a Most Requested Recipe (MRR) in our family ever since.
It also just happens to be a super smart way to cook chicken breasts. Because the meat is completely insulated by the latke mixture, this prone-to-drying-out cut stays tender and juicy. And because you horizontally halve the chicken breasts — a less messy alternative to pounding — they cook evenly and quickly, about 5 minutes per side.
My mom’s method was simple: Just coat the chicken breast in the latke mixture, then fry. But, as she reminded me, there was this one snafu: the crust kept falling off. What would happen, wondered, if treated it even more like a breaded chicken cutlet? What if assembled a dredging station with flour, egg, then the latke mixture?
Spoiler alert: It worked. By dipping the chicken in flour and egg, you prime the meat to really hold onto its crust. And because the flour and egg are already in the latke itself, this doesn’t weigh down the Big Little ingredient list at all.
Advertisement:
All you need is a simple green salad* alongside and dinner’s done. Of course, it’s totally dreamy for Hanukkah — but now that I’ve finally made the recipe for myself, have a feeling that I’ll turn to it pretty often on those other 357 days of the year. Hopefully you will, too.
https://youtu.be/hv3J-WkNzXY
2 Russet potatoes (about 12 ounces each), peeled and grated
1 small yellow onion, peeled and grated
3/4 cup all-purpose flour, divided into 3 tablespoons and 9 tablespoons
2 large eggs, divided
1 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more to taste
2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, halved horizontally (like you're slicing a cake layer in two)
6 tablespoons vegetable oil, more or less as needed
Click here to read the full recipe.
*Editors' Note: The photography and video for this article were produced before the current romaine recall. If this is the first you're hearing about that, head here to learn more . While we still encourage serving Latke-Crusted Chicken with a salad, please do not use romaine for this—or any other—recipe until the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food & Drug Administration (FDA) deem romaine safe to eat again. Kale, iceberg, or endive would all be great here instead.

Donald Trump appeals directly to men who suffer from “fragile masculinity," psychologist finds
“The political process provides a way that fragile men can reaffirm their masculinity,” Eric Knowles explains
This article originally appeared on Raw Story .
Two psychologists at New York University have conducted a study showing how President Donald Trump appeals directly to men who suffer from what they call “fragile masculinity.”
Writing in the Washington Post , New York University psychology professor Eric Knowles and psychology doctoral student Sarah DiMuccio claim that many male Trump supporters feel far more insecure in their own masculinity than they’d have you believe — and they are drawn to Trump’s authoritarian rhetoric because it makes them feel more powerful.
Advertisement:
“The political process provides a way that fragile men can reaffirm their masculinity,” they write. “By supporting tough politicians and policies, men can reassure others (and themselves) of their own manliness.”
In particular, the researchers found that there was a strong correlation between counties that voted overwhelmingly for Trump and internet searches for topics related to masculine insecurity, including “erectile dysfunction,” “hair loss,” “how to get girls,” “penis enlargement,” “penis size,” “steroids,” “testosterone” and “Viagra.”
Most interestingly, the researchers found there was not a strong correlation between these search items and votes for Mitt Romney in 2012 and John McCain in 2008, which seems to indicate that Trump was uniquely adept at awakening “fragile male” voters.
“Our data suggests that fragile masculinity is a critical feature of our current politics,” they conclude. “We suspect… Trump’s re-engineering of the as a party inextricably tied to many Americans’ identity concerns — whether based on race, religion or gender — will ensure that fragile masculinity remains a force in politics.”

Silicon Valley is undermining democracy with its dangerous ideology
Salon's Keith Spencer lays out the case for why Silicon Valley is a scourge on democracy
This article originally appeared on Truthout .
Silicon Valley has a dark side, and it doesn’t want you to know about it.
So far, it’s done a pretty decent job of keeping it from you. In fact, if you were to believe its side of the story, you’d truly think that Silicon Valley was the pinnacle of human civilization. But the sun doesn’t shine evenly into this valley, and a very different picture begins to emerge once you venture out into the shadows.
Advertisement:
In " People’s History of Silicon Valley: How the Tech Industry Exploits Workers, Erodes Privacy and Undermines Democracy ," tech writer and cultural critic Keith Spencer guides readers on a journey through the shadows. He lays out an argument for why Silicon Valley is, at its core, a highly exploitative and problematic industry that is hell-bent on spreading not only its technology, but its incredibly dangerous ideology as well.
Robert Raymond: Before we get into some of the ideas you write about in the book, think it would be helpful for us to provide some personal context. Tell us about your connection to Silicon Valley.
Keith Spencer: My family goes back to the San Francisco Bay Area many generations and has been, for the most part, un-included in the economic boom that Silicon Valley is considered to have created. When was in my 20s my grandfather — who had been born in Mountain View and lived in what is now Silicon Valley for his whole life — got evicted from where he lived when he was 90 years old. Watching that happen and hearing my family tell stories about the Bay Area and why so many of them left over the years really colored my perspective on Silicon Valley.
So that was the beginning of watching all this stuff happening in Silicon Valley and thinking, “Wow it’s interesting that everyone thinks what’s going on here is so wonderful.” Some people in tech literally say that there’s a modern renaissance happening in Silicon Valley. But my experience and my family’s experience [is] very different. So, think that was a big part of what led me to have a more critical eye on the tech industry, and then ultimately to write this book.
The housing crisis in Silicon Valley is directly related to the growing inequality of the region, and it certainly seems to have hit epidemic proportions. think many of us living here can say that we have close friends and family members who have been pushed out of their homes or even from the valley entirely. But as you outline in your book, Silicon Valley is more than just a geographic region in California.
Yeah, the thing about Silicon Valley is that it’s not really just a place like London or Greece — it’s also kind of ethereal. The term “Silicon Valley” has become synonymous with the tech industry — not just the Santa Clara Valley. And so, the thing about writing "People’s History of Silicon Valley" was that had to cover how the tech industry is affecting people’s lives across the entire world. When someone at Uber changes how the algorithm works for picking up rides, for example, an Uber driver in Mumbai is affected. Or if Facebook, all of a sudden, changes the way that you see things in your timeline, a small family business in Johannesburg may suddenly have fewer customers.
So, the decisions and choices that a small number of engineers and CEOs make in Silicon Valley have repercussions across the whole world and can sometimes radically affect or ruin people’s lives overnight. The way a small number of rich people can manipulate people’s lives so suddenly and quickly by rewriting the algorithms that govern them — that’s profoundly undemocratic.
So the book is an attempt to write a dual history that’s both about the people who physically live in Silicon Valley — not just the workers, but also the way that the technology in Silicon Valley affects everyday people’s lives — while also telling the larger story of how people across the whole world are implicated in making the tech industry function and provid[e] the profits that cause Silicon Valley to be perceived as this really wealthy place where there’s a renaissance happening, as some CEOs like to say.

want to follow up about the economic aspects of Silicon Valley, but first, let’s provide some historical context. In the book, you sketch out how Silicon Valley is intimately connected to the military, specifically through the development of radio technology around the World War era, which evolved into the computer technology of today. But there’s an interesting part of the history that we don’t usually associate with Silicon Valley: the countercultural revolution. How did the ‘60s hippie culture in California shape the culture of Silicon Valley?
There were actually lots of hippies who thought computers were these revolutionary machines that were going to free us in some way. And later, the internet also enhanced that feeling for a lot of people. There were people who thought that if we network computers together, it would just sort of innately lead to these anti-authoritarian, free networks where we could all communicate without any government or corporate control having any involvement in our lives — that we were going to be completely freed by these machines.
Right, it’s what Richard Barbrook and Andy Cameron wrote about in the “ Californian Ideology .” This weird mixture of anti-authoritarian, hippie culture that mixed into a unique brand of libertarian, tech utopianism. It’s where the idea of the “ Randian hero " sort of evolved, which served as one of the foundational mythologies that shaped Silicon Valley.

Yes. It’s unsurprising that so many tech CEOs and so many people who work in tech have really libertarian beliefs — that they ignore the social realm and don’t think of themselves as products of society, but rather as these individualistic übermensches who, by virtue of their own genius and brilliance, create these amazing products — which is patently not true. And by having libertarian politics and by spending money either directly or through their companies on lobbyists that lobby against things like fair taxation, or having any of the profits from their products go back to public coffers … they’ve ensured that there’s going to be income inequality in the Bay Area for a long time to come. It’s always astounding to think that San Francisco is lauded as one of the wealthiest cities in the country in terms of how much wealth is here. And yet, there’s so much poverty because that wealth is just not redistributed.
And a lot of the things that we think of as being intrinsic to the tech industry or to Silicon Valley were actually created by public money. lot of the basis of what the internet is, was created by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in the Pentagon. Similarly, a huge amount of the technology in the iPhone was created with public money. But those pieces of the iPhone and the internet aren’t patented in the same way that Apple or Microsoft patent their things. So, the government is essentially just giving away these technologies toward private profits.
One of the most egregious examples is [Global Positioning Systems]. Think about how much wealth is created with GPS: Uber, Lyft, Google Maps, Apple Maps — they couldn’t exist without GPS, or rather, they could exist in an inferior form, based only on your nearby Wi-Fi networks and cell networks, and they’d be way less accurate. allows your phone or computer to know where you are within a few feet, and those are all government satellites. Billions and billions of dollars were spent by the government to put those up. And when tech companies use them to create these products, they don’t pay any money back, even though taxpayers funded them.
That really seems to line up with the emerging business models in tech, especially with platform apps like Uber, for example, that really just make money off of other people’s labor. But it’s marketed as technological innovation, or freedom even. They’re really quite effective at the public relations side of things.
Part of the brilliance of Silicon Valley is this marketing idea that they create utopias. They perpetuate that even through things like office design. These little things that we think of as being such amazing amenities — they’re actually part of a system of control to make their employees want to stay at work forever and not necessarily want to go home or even need to go home because they have food at work, and have laundry at work, and even beds if they stay late at work. It’s what’s sometimes called the “golden handcuffs” effect.

Most employees in Silicon Valley are being exploited by their employers who take a cut of their surplus labor, like any other standard for-profit company. But in Silicon Valley, often white-collar employees don’t relate to other workers, they relate to the They think that anybody can become a CEO, and a founder, if they just put their mind to it. And so, they often will relate less with other exploited workers and employees, and more with their bosses who have all these tricks and systems built in place to wring as much work out of them as possible, and to pay them much less than they’re worth.
And actually, Silicon Valley has always been very anti-labor. Silicon Valley management will often argue that unions are outmoded, or they’re not innovative, or that they’re these old stodgy things that we don’t need any more because we advanced beyond them because Silicon Valley is just innately different — which it’s not. And think would say that if the book has one big point, it’s trying to shatter this illusion that Silicon Valley and the tech industry is somehow inherently different than any other capitalist enterprise. It’s not. It’s really hard for people to see that because of how the ideas around it, and the marketing around the tech industry is trafficked in our society and our culture.
So, if you were to zoom out, what would you see as some of the root causes tying together a lot of the issues you document in your book? And what do you see as potential solutions?
Generally, like many social ills that seem to be perpetuated by many industries, it’s really just a trickle-down effect of capitalism, and the way that it molds people and molds culture. And if you wanted a solution or explanation, I’d say if people who were involved in a lot of these platforms that are causing immense social ills had some type of inbuilt model of platform cooperativism, where anybody who is participating was an owner, you wouldn’t have the same problems because you wouldn’t have a central exploitative force that was pushing for these things. The way that we think of companies as existing is that it’s normal for there to be these top-down entities, where there’s someone at the top who’s making money off of all the people below them. But if that relationship were inverted and the dominant model of any business was a worker-owned cooperative … there wouldn’t be the same incentive to exploit and manipulate employees because they would own it themselves.
And even if a lot of Silicon Valley workers were unionized, it would be immensely redistributive economically — in terms of actually redistributing wealth in the Bay Area and making it a more equal place. And if, at the same time, the taxpayers were somehow getting compensated for all the technology that they created with their money that is making all these people rich, you could use that to fund public housing, for example. That would go a long way toward halting gentrification and fixing the housing crisis the tech industry created.

Democrats taking key leadership jobs have pocketed millions from Pharma
Top House Republican also received more than $1 million from drugmakers since 2007
Three of the lawmakers who will lead the House next year as Congress focuses on skyrocketing drug costs are among the biggest recipients of campaign contributions from the pharmaceutical industry, a new analysis shows.
On Wednesday, House Democrats selected Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland to serve as the next majority leader and Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina as majority whip, making them the No. 2 and No. 3 most powerful Democrats as their party regains control of the House in January.

Both lawmakers have received more than $1 million from pharmaceutical company political action committees in the past decade. Just four members of Congress hold that distinction, including Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, whom Republicans chose as the next House minority leader earlier this month.
Adding Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat expected to be the next speaker, the three-person House Democratic leadership team has collected more than $2.3 million total in campaign contributions from drugmakers since the 2007-08 election cycle, according to KHN’s database .
High drug prices surfaced as a major campaign issue in 2018. With almost half of Americans saying they were worried about prescription drug costs last summer, many Democrats told voters they’d tackle the issue in the next Congress. But the large amount of money going to key Democrats, and Republicans, raises questions about whether Congress will take on the pharmaceutical industry.
In the past decade, members of Congress from both parties have received about $81 million from 68 pharma PACs run by employees of companies that make drugs and industry trade groups.
Brendan Fischer, who directs federal reform programs at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center, said drugmakers, like other wealthy industries, “shower money” on congressional leaders who are mulling legislation that could affect the pharmaceutical industry.
“Both Democrats and Republicans have discussed taking action on prescription drug prices, and drug companies likely expect that big contributions will help them maintain access to, and influence over, powerful lawmakers,” he said.
McCarthy, who has close ties to President Donald Trump, has received more than $1.08 million from drugmaker PACs since 2007. According to the latest data, which runs through September, he received about $250,000 this election cycle.
The fourth lawmaker to top $1 million is Sen. Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican who serves on both the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions and the Senate Committee on Finance. North Carolina is also home to a number of research universities and drugmakers’ headquarters.

While campaign contributions may seem tantalizing as a metric for influence, industries are not necessarily buying votes with their cash. More likely, they are buying access — a sizable donation from a drugmaker’s may increase the chances its lobbyists get a meeting with an influential lawmaker, for example.
Clyburn, who like Hoyer has served as a top Democratic leader since 2007, has received more from drugmaker PACs over the past decade than any other member of Congress — more than $1.09 million. During the 2018 election cycle, he received at least $170,000, despite trouncing his Republican opponent in his safely Democratic district.
party leader and the highest-ranking African-American in Congress, Clyburn has had ties to the pharmaceutical industry over the years. In 2013, he was a featured speaker at a conference hosted by Ph, the industry’s leading trade group. The conference was held at the James Clyburn Research Center  at the Medical University of South Carolina, a hub for biopharmaceutical research.
This fall, Hoyer topped the million-dollar mark in drugmaker contributions over the past decade, collecting more than $1.02 million since 2007 and more than $128,000 this election cycle.

“Mr. Hoyer’s positions on legislation are based on what is in the best interest of his constituents and the American people, and he has made it clear the new Congress will tackle rising health care and prescription drug costs,” said Mariel Saez, a Hoyer spokeswoman.
Clyburn, McCarthy and Pelosi’s offices did not respond to requests for comment.
Pelosi, in contrast to her deputies, has received nearly $193,000 total from drugmaker PACs the past decade. In the month before the midterm elections, she intensified her calls for action to control drug prices, saying on Election Day that she believed Democrats could find “common ground” with Trump on addressing the problem.
Senior committee members also tend to draw huge sums from the industries they oversee. Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, the Democrat who is expected to chair the House Committee on Energy and Commerce , received nearly $169,000 this election cycle from drugmaker PACs, according to KHN’s database. Since 2007, he has collected more than $840,000.
Similarly, Rep. Greg Walden, the Oregon Republican who is finishing his term as chair of the committee, received $302,300, the most of any member this election cycle in contributions from drugmaker PACs.

By contrast, Rep. Elijah Cummings — the Maryland Democrat who is expected to head the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform — has attracted minimal drugmaker cash, receiving just $18,500 since the 2007-08 election cycle. He has made it clear that he intends to target pharmaceutical companies next year as he investigates climbing drug costs.

keeps letting guests and paid commentators lie about climate scientists
It's not true that scientists do climate research to get rich, and knows it
This article originally appeared on Media Matters .
has let at least three commentators argue this week that scientists are warning the public about climate change because they're getting rich by doing so — a ridiculous and patently false claim . knows it's ridiculous and false because the network ran a fact-checking segment debunking the claim and interviewed a climate scientist who explained why it's wrong. But even that didn't stop the network from continuing to spread the lie.
To make matters worse, the three people who made this lie on — former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-PA), former Rep. Tom DeLay (R-TX), and Trump-boosting economist Stephen Moore — have themselves been the beneficiaries of fossil fuel money, but failed to disclose that information.

lets liars lie
Following the release of the National Climate Assessment , a major government report about the dangers that climate change poses to the U.S., contributor Santorum came on "State of the Union" on Sunday morning to discuss it. Among other idiotic things, he said :
think the point that Donald Trump makes is true, which is — look, if there was no climate change, we'd have a lot of scientists looking for work. The reality is that a lot of these scientists are driven by the money that they receive, and of course they don't receive money from corporations and Exxon and the like. Why? Because they're not allowed to because it's tainted. But they can receive it from people who support their agenda, and that, believe, is what's really going on here.
Santorum's comments about climate scientists doing it for the money were widely mocked on Twitter . But that didn't stop other conservative commentators from repeating the bogus claim during appearances.
DeLay, who resigned as House majority leader in 2005 after being convicted of money laundering and conspiracy, made similar comments on "Right Now" on Monday:
The report is nothing more than a rehash of age-old 10- to 20-year assumptions made by scientists that get paid to further the politics of global warming.
does fact-checking, confirms that the lie is a lie
On Tuesday morning, CNN's John Avlon played clips of what Santorum and DeLay said and then proceeded to debunk their claims in a "Reality Check" segment:
John Avlon (political analyst): Now that talking point you're hearing is a classic bit of distraction and deflection designed to muddy the waters just enough to confuse the clear consensus. In fact, one of the scientists who worked on the climate change report, Katharine Hayhoe, confirms that she and her colleagues were paid, quote, “zero dollars” for their work and could easily make ten times their salaries by working for something like Big Oil. So it turns out that this idea that climate change scientists are rolling in the dough Scrooge McDuck-style is so pervasive that it had to have its own Yale study debunking it.
The Yale study that he referred to is a guide by the Yale Climate Communications group that lists arguments refuting the "persistent myth" that scientists are in it for the money.

then hosted the climate scientist Avlon cited, Dr. Katharine Hayhoe, who laughed at the claim that she and her colleagues are paid to advance an agenda and explained why it's incorrect:
Katharine Hayhoe (atmospheric scientist): got paid zero dollars to write this report. My salary would have been exactly the same if had or hadn't. And if were studying astrophysics like used to, I'd probably get exactly the same salary as well. The reality is that I’ve found people often accuse us of doing what they would often do themselves in our position. If we just cast our eye down the richest corporations in the world on Wikipedia's list, the vast majority of those owe their wealth to fossil fuels, so therefore they have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo as long as possible.
invites liar back on to repeat lie
But even after debunked the lie with its own programming, the network invited Moore back on to double down and repeat the discredited claim. During "At This Hour With Kate Bolduan" on Tuesday, host Bolduan played Moore a clip of Hayhoe's comments and let him respond :
Moore: She runs the climate change center at the school in Texas. What keeps those centers alive is the climate change industry. My only point is that the government in the United States and around the world has spent billions and billions of dollars on climate change. It has become an industry. That does call into question some of the partiality of this research. But the bigger point is —
Bolduan: You still don't think she is just motivated by science?
Moore: She may be. I'm not calling out any single person. I'm just saying that the industry is very, very well funded. It’s in the billions of dollars. People have a vested financial interest in talking about armageddon and these kinds of things.

invited Moore back on for yet another appearance on Tuesday, again on "Erin Burnett OutFront," in which he continued to repeat specious right-wing talking points about the National Climate Assessment.
And Santorum also got another chance to repeat the lie about climate scientists being motivated by money. During an appearance on "Anderson Cooper 360°" on Tuesday night, Santorum said :
said this the other day and I've gotten a — I've become a very popular man on Twitter in the last couple of days for the comment made about scientists making money. There would be no chair of the head of climate studies at every university in America if we didn’t have a crisis. These people make money because there's a crisis.
Santorum's appearance on "Anderson Cooper 360°" was all the more egregious because Cooper interviewed climate scientist Hayhoe for the episode, and even teased the interview during the show, but ultimately didn't air it. Hayhoe revealed this fact in a tweet , part of a longer thread about the experience:
did end up posting the interview with Hayhoe on its website . In it, Hayhoe said:
Hayhoe: What do take personally is when we are accused of being in it for the money. got paid zero dollars to write this report, and honestly, could have spent those hundreds of hours elsewhere. We don't do this for the money. We do it because we're physicians of the planet. We understand that our planet is running a fever. The impacts are serious and will become dangerous, and we have to act now, not for the good of the planet but for the good of every single human who lives on it.
Cooper: mean, that is something the president has said in the past, that this is a hoax, and that there are people who've said on our air that this is a money-making scheme essentially, this is a money-making venture.
Hayhoe: would ask them where are they getting their money from.
Great points from Hayhoe. Too bad they didn't make it on the air.

fails to disclose that liars have received fossil fuel money
While lets its commentators falsely accuse scientists of being motivated by graft, the network has failed to disclose that those very commentators have financial motivations of their own: All three have gotten money from fossil fuel interests that oppose climate action.
Santorum received $763,331 in contributions from the oil and gas industry during his time in the Senate from 1995 to 2007. His long career of shilling on behalf of fossil fuel interests paid off after he left Congress and started doing lucrative work as a consultant, including earning $142,500 in 2010 and the first half of 2011 from Consol Energy, a Pennsylvania coal and gas company. Santorum is also currently the co-chair of biofuels advocacy group Americans for Energy Security and Innovation. Anderson Cooper disclosed that Santorum is paid by the biofuels group before his discussion with Santorum, but did not note the fossil fuel money Santorum has raked in over the years.
DeLay received $739,677 in contributions from the oil and gas industry from 1985 to 2008, and gave enormous handouts to the industry during his time in office.
For his part, Moore has worked for many fossil fuel-backed advocacy groups, including the Koch-funded Cato Institute , Club for Growth , and Donors Capital Fund . He was also chief economist at the Heritage Foundation , a conservative think tank that has been funded by ExxonMobil and the Kochs. And just last last month, Moore gave a speech at the annual meeting of the Oklahoma Oil and Gas Association.

Smoking rates in have fallen to all-time low, but how did they get so high?
Smoking rates among adults have fallen to only 14%, but how did the rates get so high in the first place?
This article was originally published on The Conversation .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls cigarette smoking “the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the U.S., accounting for over 480,000 deaths per year.” The just announced that smoking rates among adults have fallen to the lowest level ever recorded — only 14 percent, less than a third the rate just 70 years ago. While this decline is remarkable, it also points to a puzzle: How did smoking rates ever get so high in the first place?
November is Lung Cancer Awareness Month , which provides a timely opportunity to review the history of tobacco smoking and its promotion.

Getting cigarettes rolling
Tobacco smoking originated in America around 3,000 Seafaring traders introduced it to Europe and Asia in the 17th century. One of the first anti-tobacco publications ever issued was King James I’s 1604 “ Counterblaste to Tobacco ,” in which he condemns the practice as “loathsome to the eye, hatefull to the nose, harmefull to the braine, and dangerous to the lungs.”
Smoking has several appeals. First, tobacco naturally contains nicotine , an insecticide, which raises alertness, speeds reaction times, and stimulates the release of neurotransmitters such as dopamine, which are associated with pleasure. Second, smoking may provide opportunities to flout authority and fit in with peer groups. Third, once someone has started smoking, attempts to stop may precipitate withdrawal symptoms such as headaches, nausea, anxiety and weight gain.
Cigarette smoking in the really caught fire in the first half of the 20th century. Technology played an important role. Through most of the 19th century, each cigarette had to be rolled by hand, which took about 15 seconds. But in 1875, a Richmond, Virginia, company offered a US$75,000 prize for the invention of an automatic rolling machine. The prize was claimed by James Bonsack, whose machine could roll 200 cigarettes per minute, dramatically increasing capacity and lowering production costs.
Wartime promotion
Over the course of World War I, cigarettes supplanted pipes as the most popular means of tobacco consumption. Soldiers who smoked pipes had to keep their loose tobacco dry, take time to fill their pipes, and relight them frequently, which could attract enemy attention. By contrast, cigarettes were quick and easy to consume. Free cigarettes were distributed to the troops, and they soon began serving as a unit of currency, with the price of a haircut, for instance, set at two cigarettes. During the war, rates of smoking tripled.
During World War II, free cigarettes were again distributed to soldiers and even included with ration kits. Soldiers were encouraged to smoke to relieve boredom and improve morale, and in 1943 their demand helped companies manufacture 290 billion cigarettes. Some tobacco ads showed patriotic wives and mothers shipping cartons of cigarettes to their loved ones on the front. At home, rationing made cigarettes scarcer, and on days they were available, people often lined up to buy them.
tobacco companies received an unexpected boost during when Germany’s Nazi Party introduced a variety of initiatives aimed to reduce smoking among both the general public and physicians. Perhaps augmented by Hitler’s personal distaste for the habit, smoking was banned in many public places, the tobacco tax was raised and educational initiatives were launched. After the war, cigarette firms were able to undermine anti-smoking campaigns by linking them to Nazi tactics.

Cigarettes’ health effects
For decades, cigarette companies strenuously denied that smoking is linked to human disease. 1954 ad that appeared in over 400 dailies was entitled “ Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers .” It declared that “interest in people’s health is a basic responsibility, paramount to every other consideration in business.” Yet it also added, “We believe the products we make are not injurious to health,” claiming that “one by one” charges that cigarettes are injurious “have been abandoned for lack of evidence.”
Tobacco companies were not content merely to deny that cigarettes are harmful. They also used print, radio, and television ads to argue that they are positively healthful. Many ads featured physicians and dentists endorsing particular brands because they were filtered or mentholated. One 1930 Lucky Strike ad claimed that “20,679 physicians say Luckies are less irritating,” calling them “Your throat protection against cough.”

Many campaigns featured celebrity endorsements . One 1947 Chesterfield ad featured popular comedian Bob Hope, saying “Dorothy Lamour is my favorite brunette. Chesterfield is my favorite cigarette.” 1950 Chesterfield holiday campaign showcased actor and future President Ronald Reagan, a cigarette dangling from his lips, saying “I’m sending Chesterfields to all my friends. That’s the merriest Christmas any smoker can have.”
To promote sales to men, campaigns linked cigarettes to masculinity. The Marlboro Man, conceived by advertising executive Leo Burnett in 1954, aimed to enhance the male appeal of filtered cigarettes, which had a feminine connotation. Running from 1954 to 1999, Marlboro ads featured rugged cowboys on the open range, often backed by bold music, such as the theme from the film, “The Magnificent Seven.” Ironically, many of the Marlboro Men eventually succumbed to tobacco-related diseases.
In the years following World War I, cigarette companies had been disappointed to find that smoking was much less popular among women than men. They soon turned to advertising to stoke demand. One campaign, “torches of freedom,” was developed by Sigmund Freud’s nephew Edward Bernays , who paid young women to light cigarettes during a 1929 Easter parade, symbolizing their emancipation. By 1935, cigarette purchases by women had more than tripled.
By the 1970s, women’s cigarette marketing often focused on themes of liberation. For example, Virginia Slims, which sponsored the women’s professional tennis tour, often promoted images of irrepressible young women with the tag line “ You’ve come a long way, baby .” The implication? By lighting up, women could strike a blow for an oppressed minority, announce their independence, and cast their lot with a svelte cadre of role models.
Where are we now?

Cigarette use has fallen to an all-time low in part because the last television cigarette ad appeared at 11:59 p.m. on Dec. 31, 1970, just one minute before a federal ban went into effect. But cigarette marketing is not dead. For example, many point-of-sale campaigns can be found in convenience stores, gas stations and even pharmacies. Such promotions now account for most of the $8.7 billion cigarette marketing budget.
Although cigarette marketing has declined considerably since its heyday, the timeliness of its lessons remains undiminished. Americans today are still subjected to marketing for a variety of hazardous products, from firearms and gambling to less obvious threats such as social media, the excessive use of which is linked to depression . So long as there is money to be made in moving such merchandise, it seems, someone will be on hand with a battery of techniques to promote sales.

Paleoclimatologists are digging into the connections between the collapse of Maya Civilization and extreme droughts
This article originally appeared on Massive .
Over 1,000 years ago, droughts plagued the Yucatan peninsula. The Yucatan was home to the Classic Lowland Maya Civilization, of pyramids and the number zero fame. Droughts occurred intermittently for centuries, from 200 to 1100 This is an era of Mayan history typically split in two — the Classic (200-800 CE) and Terminal Classic (800-1100 CE) Periods. The droughts coincided with the widespread collapse of the Maya Civilization around 1100 CE.
The first scientific evidence of these droughts was discovered by Dr. David Hodell and other researchers at the University of Florida in 1995, using ancient sediments from Lake Chinchancanab. Since then, the droughts have been a popular example of how extreme climate fluctuations can impact society. However, the magnitude of the droughts has remained an elusive and difficult question to answer. Further,  archaeological research has revealed a much more complex history of the Classic Maya reorganization than originally thought, suggesting the droughts were not the only factor destabilizing the Classic Maya. Archaeologists have found evidence that suggest the Maya Civilization experienced social changes including class conflicts, warfare , invasion, and ideological change. 20 years after the discovery of drought evidence in the Yucatan, researchers returned to Lake Chinchancanab to investigate a seemingly simple question: just how dry was it?

In the pioneering Yucatán drought research, Hoddell and his team sampled sediment cores from the bottom of Lake Chinchancanab that were thousands of years old. In the core, they found layers of gypsum, a white chalky mineral often used in plaster or cement. Because gypsum can only form in a lake setting when a large amount of evaporation has occurred, presence of gypsum in lake sediments is evidence of periods in the past where lake levels dropped significantly — signs of past drought events.
Interestingly, archaeological records show that these periods of droughts coincided with sociopolitical unrest in the region, including increased warfare and internal violence  of the Lowland Maya. This sediment core from Lake Chinchancanab was the first quantitative link between climate and instability of the Classic Maya.
Hoddell is now based at the University of Cambridge, but he and his group are still interested in human-climate connections. In this new study, his team went back to Lake Chinchancanab. The researchers are still focusing on the lake’s gypsum, but now they are looking to the ancient lake water that has been trapped in the gypsum since the droughts. The researchers developed new chemistry and modeling techniques to assess how extreme the Classic and Terminal Classic droughts were. By measuring the chemistry of the trapped ancient lake water, they established ideas for what the chemistry and depth of the lake would have looked like during the droughts. With these constraints, the researchers developed a theoretical model of a lake. They tested different climate scenarios to see how the lake chemistry would respond, until the modeled lake chemistry matched the ancient water in the gypsum. It’s the scientific equivalent of turning light switches on and off until you figure out which one is the light you actually want.
The researchers ultimately found that rainfall decreased by 50 percent on average compared to today, and as much as 70 percent during the most intense drought conditions. Humidity decreased by two to seven percent. That decrease in rainfall is the equivalent of Seattle becoming as dry as Tucson. “We don’t really know what changes in relative humidity might be in that past, because we never really had a tool to constrain it before,” says Thomas Bauska, a co-author of the study and researcher at Cambridge University. ”[The results] do tell us that the Yucatan was experiencing dry season conditions during a much longer period of the year.”
These new results and techniques can open many doors. Much of paleoclimate research relies on qualitatively studying past climate records rather than measuring past climate. It’s useful, but this approach prevents us from asking questions precise quantitative data can raise. It’s the difference between saying “wow, it was really dry in 1100 CE” and saying “there was a 50-70 percent decrease in rainfall compared to today.”
For example, we can learn a lot from the ancient Maya about human resilience and adaptation to climatic extremes. Previous studies in this region showed that during the first Classic Period droughts, the Maya adapted their agricultural practices by rotating their crops to maize (corn) varieties that required less water, but were unsuccessful at adapting in later droughts. But these results were based on qualitative paleoclimate records; hopefully providing more exact estimates of drought intensity will lead to a better understanding of how the Classic Maya reacted in the face of extreme climatic change.
This civilization flourished in the not too distant past: the demise of the Classic Maya occurred around 900–1200 (though this collapse doesn’t mean the Maya disappeared — the remaining population reorganized and formed new communities). Cambridge University, where this research was done, was founded in 1209 But there’s still so much that scientists don’t know about Mayan history. More concretely understanding the past climate changes of this region is one monumental step toward understanding how the Maya interacted with their environment

Paul Schrader wants better moviegoers, says audiences don’t take films seriously
"What there was in the ‘70s was better audiences," Schrader says about the lack of quality films plaguing Hollywood
This article originally appeared on IndieWire .
Paul Schrader has been in the movie business for well over four decades, and the one thing he’s noticed that has changed the most over the last several years is the moviegoing audience itself. Schrader, who most recently wrote and directed the acclaimed “ First Reformed ,” recently appeared at a Screenwriters Series in London and connected the dots between the current lack of quality films in Hollywood and the overall changes in moviegoing attitudes.
“There are people who talk about the American cinema of the ‘70s as some halcyon period,” Schrader said (via Deadline ). “It was to a degree but not because there were any more talented filmmakers. There’s probably, in fact, more talented filmmakers today than there was in the ‘70s. What there was in the ‘70s was better audiences.”

“When people take movies seriously it’s very easy to make a serious movie,” he continued. “When they don’t take it seriously, it’s very, very hard. We now have audiences that don’t take movies seriously so it’s hard to make a serious movie for them. It’s not that us filmmakers are letting you down, it’s you audiences are letting us down.”
Schrader explained that in the height of New Hollywood there was a balance between audiences wanting films to explore and engage with the social and political topics of the day and films delivering audiences just that. “lot of what was happening in the world had people in consternation: women’s rights, gay rights, sexual liberation, drug liberation, anti-war,” Schrader said. “All of these things were rolling on top of each other and people were turning to the arts, specifically movies, for what we should feel about this? ‘Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice’ about wife swapping, and ‘Coming Home’ about Vietnam veterans, ‘An Unmarried Woman. about female liberation.”
The “Taxi Driver” and “Raging Bull” writer went to summarize his point by saying, “If audiences are receptive to a quality movie, believe me they will get it. We’re all just waiting to make it. At that time, that period about ten, twelve years, every single week there was some kind of film coming out addressing a social issue in a fictional form.”
Schrader is currently in the middle of awards season with “First Reformed,” backed by A24. The film had a huge week at various award shows and announcements, with Schrader winning Best Screenplay honors from the Gotham Awards, the National Board of Review (Original Screenplay), and the New York Film Critics Circle. Additionally, “First Reformed” star Ethan Hawke won Best Actor prizes at the Gotham Awards and the New York Film Critic Circle. “First Reformed” is now available on demand.

Trump takes a tougher line on Pakistan, but the 2008 Mumbai attack goes unpunished
Pakistani intelligence officer and others indicted in the killings of 166 people remain at large
This article originally appeared on ProPublica .
In a sharp break from the caution and inertia of his predecessors, President Donald Trump has slashed military aid to Pakistan and warned that Washington will take further punitive measures unless the Pakistani government acts decisively against Islamist terrorists.
“They were just one of many countries that take from the United States without giving anything in return,” the president tweeted about Pakistan on Nov. 19. “That’s ENDING!”

But while the Trump administration has freely vented its frustration with Islamabad, current and former officials said it has been slow to seek justice for the 2008 massacre of 166 people — six of them Americans — in Mumbai, India, by a terrorist group that has worked closely with Pakistan’s intelligence service.
In 2011, federal prosecutors in Chicago indicted four Pakistanis, including a serving officer of the country’s powerful intelligence service, in connection with the Mumbai attacks. Yet after an initial flurry of effort by the Obama administration, the government has done little to press Pakistan to arrest those suspects or to condition support on progress in the hunt for the suspects, the officials said.
On Sunday, the State Department marked the 10th anniversary of the attacks with the administration’s first strong statement about the case. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressed solidarity with the people of India and said the “barbarity” of the massacre had “shocked the entire world.” He also added a rebuke to Pakistan.
“It is an affront to the families of the victims that, after 10 years, those who planned the Mumbai attack have still not been convicted for their involvement,” Pompeo said in a statement. “We call upon all countries, particularly Pakistan, to uphold their Security Council obligations to implement sanctions against the terrorists responsible for this atrocity, including Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and its affiliates.”
In addition, Pompeo announced that the department was offering $5 million through its Rewards for Justice Program for information leading to the arrest of anyone involved in planning or facilitating the attacks.
Nonetheless, critics say the administration’s lack of effort and attention until now shows that the matter has not been a priority. Earlier this year, a multi-agency group of national security officials agreed to prepare financial sanctions against the Mumbai suspects to try to force action by the Pakistani government. But soon thereafter, the officials involved were reassigned to other tasks, including a State Department campaign of counterterrorism measures against Iran, several officials said.
“The administration said they were going to get tougher, but it didn’t translate into action,” on the Mumbai case, said Jason Blazakis, who recently stepped down as director of the State Department’s office on counterterrorism finance and designations. “What are you doing as a government to bring these people to justice? Not a whole heck of a lot — and that’s unfortunate.”
The Pakistani government’s support for the deadly Mumbai attacks was especially brazen, and Indian investigators say. well-trained team of 10 militants, deployed by boat and directed by phone from Pakistan, slipped into the city and stormed a Jewish center, Chabad House, as well as two luxury hotels, a restaurant and a train station. The three-day rampage of shootings and bombings outraged India, Pakistan’s neighbor and nuclear-armed rival.

The attacks exposed the Pakistani government’s patronage of and control over Lashkar, a militant group that has served as Islamabad’s proxy in the longtime conflict with India over the disputed border region of Kashmir. Successive governments have also long supported or tolerated the Afghan Taliban and other Islamist groups, a circumstance underscored by the 2011 killing of Osama bin Laden at his hideout in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, less than a mile from a major military academy.
The Mumbai investigation provided extensive new evidence of the partnership between Lashkar and the powerful Inter-Services Intelligence Directorate, or ISI, of Pakistan. The arrested a Pakistani-American businessman, David Coleman Headley, who confessed to conducting undercover reconnaissance in India. Headley was an operative of both Lashkar and the ISI, and he testified that they jointly designed, financed and directed the plot, intending to kill Americans and Jews as well as Indians.
An officer known only as Major Iqbal served as Headley’s intelligence handler, overseeing his missions and helping select targets, according to case files. Headley identified his superior within Lashkar as Sajid Mir, a veteran militant who was charged with coordinating the plot. Phone intercepts recorded Mir’s calls from a high-tech command post in Karachi as he talked to a hostage in Chabad House, then ordered one of the gunmen to shoot the woman in the head.
Even before the al Qaeda attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, officials consistently subordinated their concerns about Pakistan’s ties to militants to other bilateral issues, including containment of the country’s nuclear weapons program. The Trump administration, like those of Presidents George Bush and Barack Obama, has focused primarily on urging Pakistan to act against the so-called Haqqani network — a Taliban group based in the country — and other Taliban groups that fight and Afghan troops from bases in Pakistani border areas.

Following the Mumbai attacks, the Obama administration pressed Pakistan to crack down on Lashkar. Chicago prosecutors indicted Major Iqbal in the murders of the American victims, making him the first serving officer to face terrorism charges. Pakistan responded by arresting the chief of Lashkar’s military operations, but it took no known action against Major Iqbal, Mir or others accused of planning and directing the attacks. In addition to those indicted in Chicago, counterterror agencies have assisted an Indian investigation in which prosecutors have charged more than two dozen suspects.
Publicly, the Islamabad government denied any role in the attacks and questioned whether Major Iqbal even existed. But behind the scenes, officials said, the moved him to a new unit and promoted him to the rank of colonel. Mir, meanwhile, remains “incredibly active” in Lashkar operations, one national security official said.
Pakistan has continued to protect the suspects not only to preserve its relationship with the militant group it sees as a bulwark in its operations in India and Afghanistan, but to shield itself from embarrassment or sanction and to safeguard sensitive information that they might reveal if arrested, counterterrorism officials and experts on the region said.
“It would require the introduction of the kind of evidence that the military and the do not want shared,” said Stephen Tankel, a professor at American University and former Pentagon adviser on South Asia. “There’s also the risk of alienating a reliable proxy and setting a precedent that could come back to haunt the Pakistan military and down the road.”
Of the few suspects whom Pakistan did arrest, several have been released. Others who remain in custody have been permitted by Pakistani authorities to oversee terrorist plotting while imprisoned, and Indian officials have said. The trial of seven suspects in Pakistan has lasted for years, and the proceedings have been repeatedly delayed by legal and technical problems.

In 2012, the Obama administration offered $10 million rewards for the capture of Lashkar’s religious leader, whom it accused of being involved in the Mumbai attacks, and another senior militant in the group. But as years passed without progress, Washington’s attention to the case faded, officials said. The Obama administration also stopped short of cutting aid so as not to imperil its collaboration with Pakistan on issues related to the war in Afghanistan, officials said.
Almost from the start of his presidency, Trump has taken a more confrontational approach, accusing Pakistan early this year of “nothing but lies and deceit.” His administration later lobbied successfully to put Pakistan on an international terrorism financing watch list. In September, the Pentagon redirected $300 million in military aid slated for Pakistan, and hundreds of millions more in aid have been suspended. During a recent Fox News interview, Trump alleged that Pakistan had sheltered bin Laden.
Responding on Twitter, Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan criticized actions in South Asia and said his country had suffered 75,000 casualties fighting the war on terror. “Can Mr. Trump name another ally that gave such sacrifices?” Khan demanded .
But Trump has not talked publicly about the Mumbai case or Pakistan’s failure to capture the accused killers of Americans, including at least one Pakistani official. The White House and State Department did criticize Pakistan’s release last year of Lashkar’s religious leader from temporary house arrest. And Pompeo sent a message Sunday to Pakistan with his statement about the anniversary and the $5 million reward offer.
Lashkar still poses a formidable threat, officials said. The group is loyal to the Pakistani state, and it wields power through hospitals, charities and a political party. Lashkar has not carried out another major attack, but it remains a concern because of its interest in developing weapons of mass destruction and its activity in Afghanistan and Kashmir. intelligence detected an uptick this year in Lashkar operations involving drones and paragliders, counterterrorism officials said.

“absolutely see Lashkar as a current threat,” said Blazakis, now a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey in California. “It has a state patron. It has sanctuary. It has a freedom to operate. What would happen if the group carried out another Mumbai? shudder to think about India’s response. It could steamroll into a full war between India and Pakistan.”
