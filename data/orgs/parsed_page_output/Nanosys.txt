DOTS
COLOR
Quantum Dots produce the purest colors– no other display technology even comes close. Quantum Dot displays can reproduce nearly every color found in nature for a picture so accurate, it's the next best thing to actually being there.
MORE
BRIGHTNESS
Quantum Dots enable displays to produce more light with less energy than any other material on earth for a picture that is more lifelike from the most brilliant brights to the deepest darks.
MORE
CLARITY
Quantum Dots can be switched on and off in mere 
billionths 
of a second. That’s more than 100 times faster than a stroke of lightning for incredibly smooth motion with ultra high frame rates.

, interviews of Sales and Marketing Russell Kempt on 2019 and Quantum Dot display technology’s move to the mainstream market: 
“As quantum-dot costs fall, added Kempt of quantum-dot supplier Nanosys, “it is now becoming possible for set makers to waterfall the technology across their product lineups.” As a result, by the end of 2018, “we’re beginning to see quantum-dot technology entering the mainstream market for TVs with several 65-inch products available below $1,500.”

DISPLAY
Mind your O’s & Q’s. 
Maybe you are shopping online or even standing in an aisle at store and find yourself completely surrounded by buzzwords. QLED, OLED, Quantum-this, nano-that. We’re here to help with a list of the top 8 benefits of Quantum Dot technology from Nanosys.
Click on a feature to learn more
COLOR
Get ready for an expansive range of colors that has never before been seen in a home viewing environment.  
The latest Ultra High Definition (UHD) content delivers a range of over 1 billion colors that closely matches the vibrant colors you see in real life. Only Quantum Dot displays can reproduce over 90% of this impressive UHD color spectrum for a perfect in-home color experience that matches the director’s intent.
BRIGHTNESS
Nothing else is brighter.
Quantum Dots enable displays to produce more light with less energy than any other light emitter on earth. With Quantum Dots, watching your is closer to looking out a window than ever before. Real scenes pop with the lifelike impact of high brightness enabled by Quantum Dots.  
CLARITY
Quantum Dots are faster than lightning
Quantum Dots can be switched on and off in mere 
billionths 
of a second, about one hundred times faster than a typical stroke of lightning, leaving other light emitting materials choking on our dust.  
This blazing speed enables displays with the highest refresh rates, cleaner motion through black frame insertion without compromising brightness and opens the door for exciting new display architectures in the future. 
BURN-IN
Perfect colors should not fade over time.  
Whether you watch news, sports, movies or enjoy gaming, displays made with Nanosys’ rugged, inorganic Quantum Dots always look as good as the day you bought your device. 
Display makers stand behind the technology too. The world’s largest maker recently offered an unprecedented 10 year no-burn-in guarantee for their flagship lineup of Quantum Dot TVs based on technology. 
RESOLUTION
8K? No problem. 16K? Bring it on. 
Quantum Dots can be patterned into microscopic pixels. By “microscopic” we mean, literally, pixels that you cannot see without the aide of a microscope, enabling displays with thousands of pixels per inch.  
Quantum Dots create new possibilities for incredibly lifelike near-eye applications like AR/VR (and, hey, we’ll also be ready for those inevitable 32TVs too). 
CONTRAST
Watch content in any room, any lighting condition
The contrast number on the box only tells you part of the story. Sometimes “infinite black” means “too dim". With Quantum Dots you don’t have to turn off every light in your house or close all the curtain to avoid reflections. Quantum Dots enable a bright, comfortably watchable image in any lighting condition. Whether you are viewing in a bright or dark room, images on Quantum Dot displays are more lifelike, from the most brilliant bights to the deepest darks.
METAL
is leading the display industry towards a totally Cadmium-free future.  
Our Quantum Dot technology enabled the very first 100% Cadmium-Free Quantum Dot TVs and monitors in 2015. Since then, we’ve continued to help the display industry reduce reliance on Cadmium with more great, 100% Cadmium and heavy metal free products and new innovations like our 
Hyperion materials
. 
VALUE
Uncompromising, best-in-class image quality at mainstream prices. 
Quantum Dot materials are solution processed (think printed) in open air, eliminating bottlenecks and enabling display makers to achieve faster throughput with better yields and a lower Bill of Materials compared to other advanced display materials. 
The proof is in the marketplace.
