We’ve spent over 25 million dollars over the past 5 years developing a breakthrough technology that dramatically accelerates the removal of tattoos.  Our devices use very high energy, in the range of 3,000 volts at nearly 3,000 amps, to form acoustic shockwaves at 100 times per second.  Our core team is comprised of life science veterans, with more than 150 years of life science experience, multiple device clearances, and multiple national and international aesthetic device launches.
Our Team
In order to develop our complex, breakthrough technology, we recruited some of the country’s leading scientists in acoustic engineering, plasma physics and immunology who have supported the Space Program, the nuclear fusion industry and even cancer research. Our technology has also been enabled by design partnerships with and Sanmina (the world’s largest medical device manufacturer) and supported by our shareholders, including  leading research centers.
Clinically Focused
We’re committed to holding our technology and its applications to the highest scientific standards, including ongoing clinical trials for current and future applications.  We also believe in education and transparency, and as you’ll see in our trials section, we explain what makes up a comprehensive clinical trial, and showcase our data. We continue to conduct clinical trials for tattoo removal and we are expanding our clinical trial activities to include cellulite and other aesthetic indications.
