Awards and Recognition
Sustainable Product Innovations
is proud to be a leader in designing power-efficient chips and is committed to advancing the development of sustainable technologies. Our solutions enable our customers to achieve better performance with less power, helping to create a more environmentally responsible product and a more sustainable environment.
Low-Power and Energy-Efficient recognizes the importance of energy-efficient semiconductor as one of the electronics industry’s most pressing challenges, and has taken on the challenge in developing end-to-end solutions for low-power design.
As opposed to conventional techniques to save power—such as keeping whole active to implement energy-wasting sleep or stand-by modes—engineers can use our advanced technologies and methodologies to “design-in” energy efficiency at the level of transistors and wires on silicon. These green silicon designs have already been proven to reduce power consumption. Saving power in this way not only helps protect the environment and its resources, but also enables our customers to differentiate their products in an increasingly competitive market—through enhanced energy efficiency, reduced heat, and greater reliability.
Sustainability at Our Sites
is also committed to addressing the environmental impact of our facilities and business operations. We are working to implement waste reduction initiatives, to reduce our energy and water consumption, and to minimize our overall environmental impact in our communities.
Waste Management and Recycling
Office Waste
is committed to ensuring that recyclable materials are diverted safely and correctly. Our employees actively engage in recycling, composting, and reuse programs at our facilities worldwide.
Electronic Waste
regularly reviews how we can reuse and maximize the use of our existing electronic equipment. For example, we have implemented a technology loaner program that offers older, previously used equipment to employees whose equipment may require updates or repair.
Energy Conservation
Energy-Efficient Building Features
Our largest building at our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California uses reflective roofing and architectural features to minimize solar gain and allow for less mechanical cooling energy consumption. The glass walls in this building let in more natural light, resulting in less required electricity for lighting office space. Natural ventilation is also used in place of traditional cooling where possible.
Lighting and Management
regularly reviews lighting efficiency and improvements in our facilities worldwide to create energy-efficient offices and reduce energy consumption.
Our largest building at our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California features a comprehensive lighting-control system, advanced electronic lighting ballasts, compact fluorescent and lighting, and networked systems.
We conduct routine maintenance and regularly check and fine-tune thermostat settings to be consistent with outdoor conditions and occupancy loads. By scheduling thermostat setbacks for non-critical and unoccupied spaces, we have significantly reduced our energy consumption and related costs.
Office Technology
When considering hardware for our facilities worldwide, we consider power consumption, carbon footprint, power management features, operational efficiencies, power supply efficiency ratings, cooling requirements, international standards certificates (e.g., Energy Star and EPEAT) and generic attributes, such as recyclable packaging material and reuse.
We use Energy Star-compliant desktop monitors, servers, and printers, and new workstations and laptops have Gold and Silver ratings. We have enabled energy-saving modes on our computers, conference room monitors, and projectors, and our software allows reduced energy consumption during low-demand or idle times. Additionally, we are adopting cloud technologies, resulting in energy savings.
We have also implemented collaboration tools for our employees and increased virtualization for our major events in order to reduce costs and carbon emissions related to business travel.
Datacenters
It is important for us that our datacenters increase our computing capacity, but also reduce cooling energy requirements and physical space allocations. Over the past few years we have worked to improve efficiencies in our existing datacenters in San Jose, California by reducing cooling and energy requirements at these sites and using space more efficiently.
Water Conservation
Our business operations are not water intensive, but we are nonetheless committed to water conservation in our offices and datacenters through the use of water-efficient restroom fixtures and right-sized cooling equipment, and promoting conservation efforts.
We have also adopted environmentally responsible landscaping practices by managing our landscape irrigation schedule, implementing weather-based irrigation controls, using recycled water for landscaping, and using native and sustainable plantings.
Employee Environment Initiatives
employees are doing their part to positively impact the environment. Our employees value our culture of giving back and take pride in the many opportunities to work with our communities and support efforts to build a more sustainable environment.
Bike to Work Day
Many employees around the world ride their bicycles to work. We sponsor an “Energizer Station” at one of Silicon Valley’s major bike commuting routes on Bike to Work Day and provided bicyclists with food, water, and good cheer to fuel them on their way to work.
E-waste Recycling and Disposal
To commemorate Earth Day, Cadence’s team at our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California hosts an annual e-waste recycling and collection drive for employees to environmentally recycle or dispose of any end-of-life electronics. At our facilities, our employees have collected thousands of pounds of e-waste for proper disposal.
Spare the Air Days
During Spare the Air alert days in Silicon Valley, we reduce interior lighting levels in our buildings, conference rooms, and offices to conserve energy at our corporate headquarters in San Jose, California.
Electric Vehicle Charging Stations
supports efforts to reduce carbon emissions by maintaining highly utilized electric vehicle (EV) charging stations at several sites, including the corporate headquarters in San Jose, California.
Responsible Business Alliance
is an Affiliate Member of the 
Responsible Business Alliance
 (RBA), and fully supports RBA's vision and goals:

System Enablement
System Enablement
Our strategy to help companies quickly create differentiated electronic products
Strategy: System Enablement
Cadence’s goal is to empower engineers at semiconductor and companies to create innovative, highly differentiated electronic products that transform the way people live, work, and play. Our customers are under extreme pressure to deliver new products faster and more efficiently than ever before. And the pressure, over the years, will just get more intense as the new products get much more complex.
To succeed in their highly competitive markets, our customers need to develop new with unique features that stand out in the marketplace. This is why so many companies now are developing their own specialized chips rather than purchasing them from semiconductor companies. If they use the same chips as their competitors, they won’t have an advantage in the marketplace.
companies use the basic tenets of System Enablement to everything from the software down to physical chip design. Now semiconductor companies also are paying attention to the entire system, providing their customers with a much more systems-oriented solution.
System Enablement Guides Everything We Do
Our System Enablement strategy guides everything we do to help our customers succeed. It guides our product development, the expertise and services we offer our customers, and the partnerships we develop with other industry leaders.
To really understand what our customers need, we have a three-pronged approach to System Enablement:
We develop internal expertise on the demanding requirements of the most important end markets so we can intelligently work with the leading companies in those areas.
We work directly with leading companies to develop products to meet their upcoming requirements.
We partner with other industry leaders, including software companies, to provide comprehensive integrated solutions.
We’ve had great learning experiences as we’ve worked through this strategy, and we’ve made significant improvements to our products and services. You can learn more about some of the markets we’re actively engaged in by going to our solutions pages on

Both of our board-level software products 
OrCAD
®
 and 
Allegro
®
 are continually enhanced with more capabilities for system-level analysis
Our field application engineering team is dedicated to making every customer engagement a huge success, and works closely with each customer as they adopt our technologies
We offer 
online
 and 
hands-on training classes
 around the world
This is just a sampling of the successful execution of our System Enablement strategy. We help engineers look at the high-level issues that drive major implementation decisions.
We provide a broad portfolio that focuses not just on Sodevelopment but also on the design, integration, analysis, and verification of system-level components including packaging, boards, software, and system-level We consider how these tie into the mechanical and thermal aspects of the system, and expand our ecosystem partnerships accordingly.
We believe that giving our customers a systems-level perspective throughout the cycle pays off in faster and better design, shorter verification cycles, software that works with the hardware, and new product leadership.
Our Customers Tell the Story
The renewal of many of our customer contracts and our customers’ decisions to make new purchases from us are dependent upon our success with our System Enablement strategy. We’re pleased that so many of our customers are delighted to provide stories to highlight what tools, hardware, and have done for their success.

At the ®
 Academic Network, we strive towards building a strong relationship between academia and industry. We facilitate this exchange of knowledge by co-organizing training, workshops, and technology days; providing professional services; and helping with educational material, in addition to providing access to the latest technologies. Here are some of the many ways in which we facilitate the exchange of ideas.
Lead Institutions
Lead Institutions are “lighthouse” universities, where academic staff have proven their expertise in education and research in a certain technology and act as key influences to the Academic Partnerships Office at Cadence. These staff members promote their experience by connecting with other universities and by helping them to establish a professional level of technology use. Each Lead Institution maintains a certain Academic Network LinkedIn subgroup for information exchange with those subgroup members. They collaborate closely with on activities such as summer schools and technology days to promote the academic use of the latest technologies. Lead Institutions represent the spirit of the Academic Network and contribute to its success.

Lead Institutions

Academic Network Contributors
Academic Network Contributors are institutions that have played an important role in the success of the Academic Network. This continuous collaboration between the Academic Network program and contributors is apparent in a number of ways, such as workshops and project collaborations. We encourage the contributors' submissions of papers to our user conferences, such as 
CDNLive,
 and welcome their participation in our new 
Lab Certification Program
. We often accept their recommendations for future interns, an opportunity for students to gain fantastic insight into the electronics industry from our valuable position as a world-leading tool provider.

What’s New in Allegro EDM

Schematic Capture
Data Management
Previous Releases
All your projects consist of many moving parts, with multiple members of various teams providing input and demanding output. Efficiently tracking and managing all aspects of your improves overall productivity and resource efficiency and provides valuable insights into the process you can use to run even better teams. The ®
 Allegro
®
 Solution addresses multiple facets of information within engineering and now extends directly to the enterprise and manufacturing.
Release to Manufacturing
The data created in a is a critical component to the product record. With Allegro EDM’s integrated release-to-manufacturing capability, engineering teams can frequently, accurately, and efficiently update enterprise systems, such as product lifecycle management (PLM). Release to manufacturing obtains the current state of the bill of materials (BOM), variants, data, and manufacturing deliverables in the context of the corporate workflow, such as the engineering change order (ECO) and release processes with little to no additional work by the engineer. Eliminating the costly time engineers spend manually extracting and uploading data while improving the quality and frequency of the release. The improved collaboration allows better visibility across manufacturing, supply chain, and management reducing time, cost, and risk in the overall process while allowing engineers to focus on innovation.
Engineers Stay Inside Allegro Environment
Executing a successful release of data into the enterprise or manufacturing environment does not need to be a disruptive or time-consuming task. Engineers initiate a release directly from the current project, keeping track of the current project and part numbers, and removing data entry.
Corporate Product Structure and Workflow
Designers are concerned about the technical aspects of the design; however, to have that realized, engineers may have to create, or know how to map, manufacturing deliverables and into the corporate product structure. Additionally, they must adhere to differences in deliverables based on the current workflow state of the project in Using a centrally controlled template-driven approach, corporate standards, such as product structure creation, validation rules, and adherence to workflow, are automatically managed for the engineer, removing the guesswork for engineers, enabling adherence to corporate process, and eliminating rework due to missing, incomplete, or incorrect data
Maps to Existing Corporate and Engineering Process
Administrators employ a highly configurable web interface to centrally manage the overall process used by their engineers. The high level of configurability allows administrators to map the existing process into the existing enterprise process, minimizing disruption and reducing training. Administrators can maintain multiple configurations to support the changing needs of the corporate and processes, enabling the needs of an agile enterprise.
Always Up-to-Date Component Selection
When used with Library Management, engineers are kept up to date with all corporate part numbers, attribution, and status. Automating this with a direct connection into reduces the chances engineers will choose invalid parts and virtually removes and component status issues when releasing a for manufacturing. As the central library directly receives information, librarians no longer need to perform the manual tasks of keeping constantly changing part data fresh—and they may instead focus on providing engineers the quality library components needed.
Integration with Library Management
Libraries are the building blocks of all your designs. Properly managing them is the difference between a strong foundation for your entire business, and a jaw-dropping domino fall leaving a clear path of collapse behind.
Reusable Alternate Footprint Sets
Define compatible alternate footprints in your component library, and improve library consistency with a few clicks. Easily define an alternate set of footprints for a part by viewing and selecting the complete set of footprints used by similar parts.
Complex Part and Model Properties
Define part or model properties as a combination of other properties, such as voltage, tolerance, and value. This enables, for example, a part’s to be built from a combination of multiple other properties and when those properties change, is updated automatically.
Support for and LDAPS
Ensure the confidentiality and security of your data with technology and support for Lightweight Directory Access Protocol over Secure Sockets Layer (LDAPS).
Release Cycle Support for Manufacturer Part Numbers
Use the database editor to check out, modify, check in, and release manufacturer parts just as you would any other part. Add distribution and development status as well as lifecycle information to manufacturer parts.
Part Check In and Check Out with Hierarchical Linked Models
Save time searching for and checking out the various models associated with parts during the part editing process using hierarchical checkout. After updating the models, check in all of them in one step.
Engineering Data Analytics
Collecting and storing data is not the end goal. You must understand how your data relates, analyze your data, and put those insights to good use to improve every step of the process.
Multi-Site and Multi-Application Support
Define and manage engineering data used within different business units by separating the web pages used for multiple sites or divisions. metrics can be viewed on the site and business unit levels in addition to companywide. Administrators, groups, and users of enterprises large and small can be common or separated through access permissions to share all the data you want, and none that you don’t.
Dynamic Project Labels
Use project metadata such as project name, schematic revision, schematic number, board revision, or any data of your choice to dynamically label and manage your complete set of project data. Dynamic labels can be reused, making it easy to manage all your labels.
Multi-Board System Project Support
Roll up all your data and metrics from multiple projects and workspaces into a single container for increased system-wide visibility and predictability. Seed new by selecting individual projects from previous, possibly disparate, systems.
Compare Vendor and Variant Parts Lists  
Choose the right vendor for your project by comparing parts lists from different vendors and assessing a vendor’s ability to supply a complete Compare multiple variant BOMs to help optimize cost and availability for your designs.
Data Management Activity Log
Gain insights into your process by analyzing the change history during a design’s life cycle. Track strategic parts list approvals, who checked-in what and when, what changes they made, which configuration management labels have been used, and a range of other data.
Import Data for Custom Metrics
Manufacturer availability, engineer loading, and pending vacations—there’s so much that affects the progress of a project that isn’t about the itself. Import data and visualize custom metrics about your project in your project dashboard.

 Key Benefits
Reduces time and optimizes resources associated with library development and verification through integrated creation and validation processes
Increased accuracy during the part creation process
TÜSÜ“Fit for Purpose – TCL1” certified to meet 26262 automotive functional safety requirements
Library creation is often a tedious, time-consuming task requiring a high degree of manual effort for development and validation of required parts. Large pin count devices, now becoming the norm for most designs, are especially challenging and prone to error if automated processes are not employed. 
®
 Allegro
®
 Librarian provides a powerful mix of functionality that includes the ability to quickly import and manipulate data, split pins across multiple symbols, and define visibility for power and ground pins. The capability to automatically manage, track, and save part versions while continuously recording differences removes the need for manual intervention and greatly increases accuracy during the part creation process. 

For companies who may have multiple tool sets, Allegro Librarian provides a single development environment and supports import/export of other vendors’ library data in addition to common industry file formats. Part creation can be further accelerated by directly importing pin tables and pin grids, which can then be customized to meet company-specific standards. 

Finally, real-time validation and built-in rule checks at each stage of the part creation process ensures that schematic symbols and footprints are always in sync. All of these capabilities are also an integral part of Allegro EDM and provide the foundation for a company requiring a larger scale library and data management environment.
Automotive TCL1 Certified for 26262
The industry’s first and verification flow to achieve “Fit for Purpose - Tool Confidence Level 1 (TCL1)” certification enables you to meet stringent 26262 automotive safety requirements. The flow includes everything from authoring to simulation to physical realization and verification using the PSpice
®
, Allegro, and OrCAD
®
 product suites. The high-performance entry, simulation, and layout editing tools provide an integrated environment for engineers to validate the safety specifications against individual circuit specifications for confidence. For information on the safety manuals, Tool Confidence Analysis (TCA) documents, and compliance reports from TÜSÜD, download the 
Functional Safety Documentation Kits
 through Online Support.

 vManager
™
 Metric-Driven Signoff Platform is a first-of-its-kind automation platform for verification planning and management. The vManager platform is a true enterprise-class solution fueled by client-server technology, a commercial database, and an industry-standard enterprise API, all of which mean scalability for small to ultra-large verification projects.
Comprehensive and Integrated vManager Platform
The heart of the functional verification process is the verification plan (vPlan), which back-annotates results to a live plan (executable), and defines verification complete. With the vManager platform, you can improve your quality while benefiting from improved productivity, predictability, controllability, and coordination of your functional verification process. The vManager platform can execute pre-silicon verification testing with Cadence’s 
Xcelium
®
 Parallel Simulator
, 
JasperGold
®
 Formal Verification Platform
, or 
Palladium Z1
®
 Enterprise Emulation Platform
.
The vManager platform can be used to manage the following verification initiatives:
Formal designer handoff 
– Utilize assertions, directed scenarios, and formal verification “apps” to get to designer verification faster and easier than simulation, with clear handoff guidelines to the verification team
digital simulation or acceleration
 – Verify digital designs from to Soat or gate level, with a comprehensive set of coverage metrics compatible across the 
Verification Suite
, optimized by the JasperGold platform, and accelerated by the Palladium Z1 platform
Mixed-signal verification
 – Real number modeling verification and integration with the 
Virtuoso
®
 Verifier
 accelerates closure of analog or mixed signal designs and provides optimal R&efficiency
Low-power verification
– Verify all power domains, power-up sequences, and user-driven scenarios starting with or 1801 definition files, which are visible as verification plans with back-annotated results driven by the vManager platform
Functional safety verification
 – Leveraging the same functional verification environment, define failure modes, formally reduce fault space, and automatically execute fault campaigns with traceability to verification and safety
Software-driven verification
 – Combine from many sources, assemble, and execute integration test scenarios using the 
Perspec
™
 System Verifier
’s pre-defined libraries or user-written libraries, changing the focus from metrics to exhaustive use-case coverage and integration verification
verification
 – Starting with a high-level in C/C++ and 
Stratus
™
 High-Level Synthesis (HLS)
, shift left your functional verification efforts to spend less time verifying the model and less time verifying the synthesized RT
Application software verification
 – Define application software test scenarios, execute jobs to the 
Protium
™
 S1 Rapid-Prototyping Platform
, and measure test results and software code coverage metrics
For designers
The vManager platform lets you easily define and execute your own tests or tests written for you from the verification engineer, and collaborate with your verification team in real time, sharing test cases and doing root cause analysis. Tests can be based on the Xcelium simulator or the JasperGold platform, using the vManager platform to share results.
The vManager platform is the ultimate experience to directly measure functional progress and drill down to bin-level details of the unified coverage database (UNICOV) with the embedded 
Integrated Metrics Center (IMC)
. The vManager platform can optimize the farm with ranked tests and smart regressions. Post-execution, the vManager platform will aggregate and merge coverage across engines to see a single result, and intuitively organize verification plans by features to maximize comprehension and reporting visibility.
single cockpit provides execution to results starting from plans, to optimization techniques using formal engines, fault campaign execution of hundreds to thousands of faults in parallel, and traceability and reporting per 26262 guidelines.
For verification and project managers
The vManager platform provides the automation for aggregating and reporting results, based on real project metrics. Enabled by data congruency across the Verification Suite, the vManager platform tracks projects and subprojects individually, and aggregates results to a single unified view. It tracks progress, compares to goals, and provides a simplified web-based dashboard for easy viewing and measurement of milestones.
Key Features
The vManager platform is a true enterprise-class infrastructure that:
Supports multiple users and user types simultaneously
Enables configuration of multiple projects using a single infrastructure
Provides deep integration to execute on a Xcelium, JasperGold, Palladium Z1, or Protium S1 platform
Aggregates data across multiple sites and enables remote access for remote engineers

JOSE, Calif., 20 Nov 2018
Highlights:
Complete single-vendor solution for GDDR6 speeds chip integration and reduces interoperability risk
Using Samsung’s 7process, has taped out 7nm GDDR6 IP
is ready to engage with and verification customers now
Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CDNS) today announced the tapeout of a complete GDDR6 memory solution on Samsung’s 7process. GDDR6 memory is targeted at very high-bandwidth applications including machine learning, AI, cryptocurrency mining, graphics, automated driving, and high-performance computing (HPC). The ®
 GDDR6 solution consists of PHY, controller and Verification (VIP). Samsung is enabling this advanced on the 7foundry process for customers to next-generation chips in the hottest application areas, for use with high-performance GDDR6 memory products. For more information, please visit 
. 
Until now, memories have been predominantly used for graphics applications, with limited use elsewhere. As a result, DDR4 and LPDDR4 have been the memories of choice for early adopters addressing high-bandwidth memory applications. GDDR6 offers 5faster memory bandwidth than the fastest speed of DDR4 at a moderate cost, making it ideal for such applications. However, at GDDR6 data rates requires new architecture and techniques, which has limited the adoption of technology in non-graphics applications in the past. Samsung and are poised to address this market need with robust GDDR6 solutions that include the industry-leading Denali
®
 controller and silicon-proven high-speed SerDes technology.
The new GDDR6 allows up to 16Gb/sec bandwidth per pin, or over 500Gb/sec peak bandwidth between the Soand each GDDR6 memory die. This enables users to high-memory-bandwidth GDDR6 interfaces with a lower number of dies than is possible with DDR4, reducing both area and packaging pins. Cadence’s unique, single-vendor GDDR6 solution speeds integration and reduces interoperability risk. In addition, customers benefit from reduced risk of interoperability issues between their Soand memory devices because the GDDR6 was developed in close collaboration with Samsung. rounds out the complete offering, with the GDDR6 Memory Model delivering the advanced checks, coverage, verification planning and modeling flexibility required to mitigate memory silicon escapes using the Verification Suite. 
Additional Features/Benefits of the GDDR6 IP:
techniques reuse technology from Cadence’s silicon-proven and SerDes designs, resulting in lower risk when implementing GDDR6
Low bit-error rate (BER) reduces retries on the memory bus, providing greater bandwidth and lower maximum latency
Cadence’s wide margin allows users to implement GDDR6 on PCBs with common materials such as FR4, reducing the cost of GDDR6 deployment
Cadence’s GDDR6 reference allows users to replicate Cadence’s test chip results in their own products
Cadence’s industry-leading VIP, now extended with GDDR6 support, enabled robust verification of the GDDR6 interface 
“GDDR6 is necessary for broader adoption in graphics, AI, machine learning, and other applications requiring very high-memory bandwidth,” said Jaehong Park, senior vice president of Foundry Service Team at Samsung Electronics. “Cadence’s tapeout of GDDR6 in Samsung Foundry’s 7process is a milestone in our successful collaboration to deliver a superior GDDR6 solution to our mutual customers.” 
“Through our collaboration with Samsung and successful GDDR6 tapeout, is well positioned to accelerate market adoption of this vital new technology,” said Amjad Qureshi, corporate vice president, R&D, at Cadence. “Our complete GDDR6 solution leverages industry-leading technology and proven techniques to both reduce implementation risk and speed time to market. Soproviders can start their next-generation memory designs today with the confidence that GDDR6 is ready for integration.” 
Availability
GDDR6 and memory models are available now for customer engagements. files are ready for select customers to begin integration work with confidence that the GDDR6 will work as intended in its application.

Introduces the Tensilica HiFi 5 DSP, the First Optimized for Speech and Audio Processing 
HiFi 5 delivers up to 4improvement on neural network-based speech recognition algorithms
JOSE, Calif., 31 Oct 2018
Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CDNS) today announced the ®
 Tensilica
®
 HiFi 5 for audio and voice, the first core optimized for high-performance far-field processing and artificial intelligence (AI)-based speech recognition processing. This fifth-generation HiFi offers 2audio processing and 4neural network (NN) processing improvements versus the HiFi 4 DSP, making it ideal for voice-controlled user interfaces in digital home assistants and automotive infotainment.

. 
The new Tensilica
®
 HiFi 5 for audio and voice is the first core optimized for high-performance far-field processing and artificial intelligence (AI)-based speech recognition processing.
Following the popularity of digital home assistants, voice-controlled user interfaces are increasingly important to manufacturers of innovative consumer products. Advanced algorithms are rapidly evolving to eliminate noise and isolate the speakers’ voice for increased understanding, requiring higher processing capabilities and improved energy efficiency. Additionally, NN-based speech recognition algorithms are performing more tasks locally, rather than in the cloud, due to concerns of latency, privacy and network availability.
“To meet the extremely difficult challenge of bringing computationally intensive NN-based far-field processing and speech recognition algorithms to energy-sensitive devices, Ambiq Micro chose to be the first silicon licensee of Cadence’s HiFi 5 DSP”, said Aaron Grassian, vice president of marketing, Ambiq Micro. “Porting the HiFi 5 to Ambiq Micro’s Subthreshold Power Optimized Technology (SPOT) platform enables product designers, ODMs and OEMs to take the most advantage of technology from audio software leaders like Concepts and Sensory by adding voice assistant integration, command and control, and conversational UIs to portable, mobile products without sacrificing quality or battery life.”  
Key features of the HiFi 5 include:
Five very long instruction word (VLIW)-slot architecture capable of issuing two 128-bit loads per cycle
2capability versus HiFi 4 for pre- and post-processing, includes:
Support for eight 32x32-bit or 16 16x16-bit MACs per cycle
Optional eight single-precision floating-point MACs per cycle
4capability versus HiFi 4 for processing, includes:
32 16x8 or 16x4 MACs per cycle
Optional 16 half-precision floating-point MACs per cycle 
The new HiFi library offers a highly optimized set of library functions commonly used in processing (especially speech). These library functions can easily be integrated into popular machine learning frameworks.
Software compatibility with the complete HiFi product line totaling over 300 HiFi-optimized audio and voice codecs and audio enhancement software packages.
“The dramatic rise in popularity of digital home assistants that feature compelling voice experiences has sparked a new wave of innovation in far-field processing algorithms and in neural network-based speech recognition,” stated Larry Przywara, group director of marketing, Tensilica audio/voice at Cadence. “The HiFi 5 addresses both of these high-performance compute concerns with improved floating- and fixed-point capabilities and native support for new data types, saving memory and power. The HiFi 5 maintains code compatibility with the existing HiFi product line, which means a large ecosystem of audio software is already available.”
Partner/Analyst Quotes
“processing at the edge is a reality in today’s digital home appliance market,” stated Mike Demler, Senior Analyst at The Linley Group. “Due to consumer demands for lower latency, increased privacy and more natural voice interactions, the processing work load on device is increasing rapidly. The HiFi 5 DSP offers the performance needed to handle front-end processing including echo cancellation and noise-reduction tasks, and its new 32-MAC/cycle neural-network engine with native support for smaller weight sizes offers an efficient solution for running complex speech-recognition algorithms.”
“An interesting challenge for OEMs is the demand to incorporate new DSP-intensive audio features, while at the same time supporting shorter and shorter development schedules,” said Paul Beckmann, Chief Technology Officer, Concepts. “To meet both of those competing demands, product makers can choose powerful processing cores like the HiFi 5 with its 2improvement in floating-point performance, and then rapidly build out their audio features with graphical configuration tools like Audio Weaver Designer. Without both capabilities—modern silicon and modern development tools—it's really tough to keep pace.”

Tight integration of the full RTL-to-signoff digital flow enabled Cypress to improve tool throughput and achieve productivity gains 
Spectre next-generation FastSpice simulator evaluation yielded up to 10turnaround time improvement over its previous flow
Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CDNS) today announced that after an extensive competitive evaluation, Cypress Semiconductor Corp. selected the full Cadence® RTL-to-signoff digital flow and complete Spectre® circuit simulation platform for all of its 40nm automotive chip designs. The evaluation process showed Cypress the opportunity to dramatically improve its turnaround time and productivity with the solution when compared with its previous flow. 
The digital flow consists of the Innovus™ Implementation System, the Genus™ Synthesis Solution, the Tempus™ Timing Signoff Solution, Conformal® Low Power and the Quantus™ Extraction Solution. These tools collectively enabled Cypress to achieve improved individual tool throughput and productivity gains. Specifically, the Innovus Implementation System provided Cypress with significant power, performance and area (PPA) benefits. 
In particular, low power was a critical requirement for the Cypress 40nm automotive designs. Cypress develops complex designs with multiple power domains that require comprehensive constraints and many timing modes and corners. The low-power flow offers 1801 support, and provided Cypress with area and power reductions. 
The Spectre circuit simulation platform, including the Spectre Classic Simulator, the Spectre Accelerated Parallel Simulator (APS), the Spectre eXtensive Partitioning Simulator (XPS) and the Spectre Option, can provide Cypress with improved accuracy, speed and ease of use. The initial Spectre next-generation FastSpice simulator evaluation yielded up to 10turnaround time improvement over Cypress's previous flow.

"We're always up against tight deadlines to deliver innovative and reliable designs to our automotive customers," said Dragomir Nikolic, worldwide director at Cypress. "While looking at the digital offerings from Cadence, specifically the Innovus Implementation System and the Tempus Timing Signoff Solution, we've seen an opportunity to improve our quality of results while significantly reducing cycle time. We know these offerings are state of the art in the industry, and we are eager to see the tools in action on our 40nm platform. In addition to low power, reliability and low parts per billion (PPB) defect rates are critical for us. The Innovus Implementation System routing capability enables us to drive those defects even lower for our automotive customers."
