Safety is primary consideration when engineers design an airplane. In addition to meeting regulatory requirements before certification, each airplane model must meet Boeing’s time-proven design standards.

StartupStarting an airline is tough. Running a profitable airline is even tougher. From startup airlines to established industry leaders, process involves constant learning and adaptation.
Few businesses have as many variables and challenges as airlines. They are capital-intensive. Competition is fierce. Airlines are fossil-fuel dependent and often at mercy of fuel price volatility. Operations are labor intensive and subject to government control and political influence. And a lot depends on weather.
But, intrepid entrepreneur is not alone. Startupteam assists entrepreneurs in launching new airlines. From concept through launch, Startupoffers guidance, review, analysis, data, resources, contacts, and referrals to qualified startup airlines.

Revenue Recognition Accounting Standard 606 Information
During first quarter of 2018, adopted a new revenue recognition accounting standard (606) which, among other things, imposes additional criteria for recognizing contracted backlog with customers beyond existence of a firm contract to deliver. In connection with application of 606, 78 orders have been removed from backlog. Apart from adding table below and modifying "Changes" line in 2018 Net Orders table to reflect any 606 adjustments applicable to 2018 Net Orders, this site has not been adjusted for adoption of 606, and reflects all orders for which we have a firm contractual commitment. As such, aircraft identified for a specific customer on this site may not necessarily contribute to totals for backlog and/or other amounts included in our financial statements. figures in table for Total Unfilled Orders and Backlog include orders, listed on this site, of Capital Corporation.

From Renton to World
Here we stand at front of factory assembly line. Since 1942, Renton has been home to some of greatest engineering feats commercial flight has ever seen. 12,000-person workforce comes together in huge buildings throughout site to create every 737 in world. And with Boeing's continuous stream of production innovations and improvements, it's happening at a pace never before seen.
Those two fuselages, just off train from Wichita, Kansas, will be loaded into factory, assembled, ready for flight in an astounding 10 days. Humans and machines working together to create world's most popular and reliable commercial airplane.
At each location along this tour you'll have 360-degree views of factory. Click on icons to learn more about a location, from its rich history to innovative future. When you're ready to follow along next step of 737 journey, open menu and choose next location.
Move to Lake
In early 2000s 737 program moved office workers out of underutilized buildings and into new work areas in vacant space in Renton factory. Putting support people next to factory team assembling airplanes helped to improve communication and reduce flow time, enabling employees to build airplanes more efficiently.

737 CLASSIC
In 1970, as a response to a severe economic recession, consolidated all single-aisle programs in Renton. This photo, taken in November 1970 shows all three single-aisle models together for first time including 707, 727 and very first Renton-built 737. Up to that time 737 final assembly was at Thompson Site on Field, a facility originally built for assembly of 737. first Renton-built 737, line number 272, rolled out on November 17, 1970.

757 Rollout
On January 13, 1982, 757 rolled out at Renton as replacement for highly successful 727. 757 was a pioneer in many ways. One of first twinjets to use highly efficient high-bypass engines, 757 was also designed with an two-crew flight deck that it shared with 767, a first for large commercial jets. 757 and 767 also pioneered computerized "glass cockpit" for commercial jets, replacing dials and gages with screens. On November 28, 2005, concluded remarkable 23-year run of 757 with 1,050 produced.

Next Generation is Now
We're now standing high above Next-Generation 737 assembly line. Here, employees take fuselages and transform them into flight-ready airplanes. Renton site is rich with aviation history, with production starting in WWII, manufacturing everything from PB2Sea Ranger Bomber to B-29 Superfortress to 707 — world's first successful commercial jetliner — and today, 737.
From this vantage point, we can see entire life cycle of 737 in factory, which lasts 10 days. Starting in fuselage hub, then flowing through assembly line, every plane meets a set of rigid standards before moving to next station. Each Next-Generation 737 is made up of more than 600,000 parts, and has built more than 9,300 737s to date, including early versions of airplane as well as Next-Generation models.
key to Boeing's assembly line is its flexibility and efficiency — ready to adapt at any time. goal is to continually increase production rate of 737, eventually reaching 57 planes a month to meet market demand.
Building Next Generation 737
Third Shift: Moving Large Items
Moving Line: Before & After
Before Moving Line
Wasted time - mechanics picked up tools, parts and transported them to work area
Support groups such as Engineering were in buildings adjacent to factory buildings
Time spent moving aircraft around
After Moving Line
Adoption of Lean: Make product flow, not people
Work flow centered on airplane and mechanics — keep mechanics within short distance of airplane
Airplane, tools and parts delivered to mechanics
Along with other Lean manufacturing methods, this innovative technique improves production efficiency and quality, while shortening time it takes to deliver airplanes to airline customers.
Hydrofoil Production in Renton
Renton has also been home for production of both civil and military hydrofoil ships. Beginning with Navy Hydrofoil Missileship Pegasus (PHM-1), launched in November 1974, employees produced five more Pegasus class ships — Hercules, Taurus, Aquila, Aries and Gemini between 1981 and 1982.
These were first Boeing-built craft, and first hydrofoils, to be a commissioned as a United States Ship (USS).
Renton also produced commercial Jetfoil hydrofoils. Designed for passenger comfort at high speeds standard configuration of Jetfoil accommodated 250 passengers but design flexibility allowed variations for up to 350 seats.
Renton produced 24 Jetfoils between 1974 and 1985.
Night Moves: Production Line 'Reset'
Engine Build-Up
During engine build-up all systems needed to connect engine to wing and enable it to operate are installed. Engines used to arrive in factory on a rail system, but program switched to a tool that an operator can navigate through factory and also use to raise and lower engines to prepare them for installation, including installing pre-assemblies.
Modular Wheel Well
Engineers and mechanics on 737 program collaborated to drastically reduce number of parts that had to be assembled before installing systems in wheel well of each 737. result was a significant time savings and cost reduction on thousands of world's best-selling commercial airplane — and all 737s still on company’s order books.
Lean and Moving Line
saw an opportunity to cut production time by adopting principles of Lean manufacturing. Renton production system also evolved from putting airplanes in a slant, or angled, position in factory to a nose-to-tail configuration. This enabled 737s to be produced on a pulse line or a moving line, much like moving lines used to produce automobiles.

As these mammoth machines drill, install and shave metal fasteners in seconds, technicians listen for any irregularities in sound. It takes a precise ear to hear when rare, potential problems may arise, especially when you consider that these machines are drilling approximately 40,000 holes a day. It's a great example of humans and machines working side by side.
machines are quite remarkable themselves, improving safety and quality of overall manufacturing process. increased quality by enabling a demanding manual job to be replicated quickly by an automated machine, under watchful eye and ear of experienced mechanics. greatly reduces risk of repetitive use injury to factory workforce. This panel assembly process speaks volumes to Boeing's investment and commitment to their customers, enabling improvements in safety, quality and flow time, all major keys in Renton's trajectory toward manufacturing 57 planes a month.
Launch of Jet Age (707)
707-320 4-21 — TODAY'(PAL)
At beginning of 1967 new 4-81 and 82 assembly buildings were ready to be occupied. Over a weekend in early January, Renton employees moved entire 727 assembly line from 4-21 to 4-81, leaving behind 707 as seen in this photo taken in May 1967.

Efficiency to MAX
In front of you is a new 737 MAX, newest member of 737 family. This is most efficient airplane in single-aisle segment, with about 20 percent greater fuel efficiency than first Next-Generation 737 and 10 percent greater fuel efficiency than any other airplane in single-aisle segment.
Everything about 737 assembly is lean, with an assembly line designed to maximize space. Whether it's every cart being labeled or having every part of process movable by wheels or crane, is a model for efficiency. As production of continues to increase, this plane will bring both airlines and flying public a more efficient and environmentally friendly option to pursue their dreams.
