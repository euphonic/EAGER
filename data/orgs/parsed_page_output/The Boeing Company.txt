StartupStarting an airline is tough. Running a profitable airline is even tougher. From startup airlines to established industry leaders, process involves constant learning and adaptation.
Few businesses have as many variables and challenges as airlines. They are capital-intensive. Competition is fierce. Airlines are fossil-fuel dependent and often at mercy of fuel price volatility. Operations are labor intensive and subject to government control and political influence. And a lot depends on weather.
But, intrepid entrepreneur is not alone. Startupteam assists entrepreneurs in launching new airlines. From concept through launch, Startupoffers guidance, review, analysis, data, resources, contacts, and referrals to qualified startup airlines.

Revenue Recognition Accounting Standard 606 Information
During first quarter of 2018, adopted a new revenue recognition accounting standard (606) which, among other things, imposes additional criteria for recognizing contracted backlog with customers beyond existence of a firm contract to deliver. In connection with application of 606, 78 orders have been removed from backlog. Apart from adding table below and modifying "Changes" line in 2018 Net Orders table to reflect any 606 adjustments applicable to 2018 Net Orders, this site has not been adjusted for adoption of 606, and reflects all orders for which we have a firm contractual commitment. As such, aircraft identified for a specific customer on this site may not necessarily contribute to totals for backlog and/or other amounts included in our financial statements. figures in table for Total Unfilled Orders and Backlog include orders, listed on this site, of Capital Corporation.
