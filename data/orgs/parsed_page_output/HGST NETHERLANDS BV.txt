1956
The seeds are sown for the eventual founding of Western Digital when invents the world's first           hard drive, the Model 350 Disk Storage Unit (aka the RAMAC). The first was the size of a           refrigerator and weighed 2,140 pounds (971kg), but could only hold roughly 5of data, or one           song by today's standards. This division of was sold to Hitachi's storage division in 2003 before eventually being acquired by Western Digital.
TRIVIA
What do the Golden Gate Bridge and ladies pantyhose have in common with the first RAMAC?
The RAMAC's 50 vertically stacked discs were coated in a magnetic oxide paint similar to             that used on the bridge. But not before first being strained through ladies' pantyhose and             then poured onto blank rotating aluminum disks.
