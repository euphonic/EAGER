Looking back on my days in graduate school, remember reading some classic research publications written by well-respected scientists from the early 20th century.  What struck me then – and remains with me now – is the breadth of their manuscripts and the years it took to complete their research.
In today’s “publish or perish” environment, the work of these masters may seem like an anachronism, but then again, where would we be today without their ground-breaking accomplishments?  One of the world’s greatest scientists, Sir Isaac Newton, recognized the importance of those who came before him when he modestly noted “If have seen further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants."
In Newton’s time (and continuing through much of the next three centuries), scientific research was a painfully slow process.  Extracting information needed for basic research wasn’t easy and was limited to the very few scholars who had the time, inclination and resources to properly conduct studies. And communication about their discoveries could take years to fall upon the ears of an aspiring scientist, who only then could build upon the previous work.  My how things have changed!
Today, in the age of the Internet, research publications are often posted immediately online before they can be viewed in print publications. Many scientists working from different countries may co-author the same research paper and some publications are made available to almost anyone through “open access journals,” further increasing the flow of scientific communication. The rapid transmission of information may not have the depth of the research publications of yesteryear, but it does allow for the cascading acceleration of knowledge that would have been unthinkable just a few generations ago.

The list of partnerships and collaborations goes on and on, but the key driver behind all of these projects is the same:  that our collective knowledge is more powerful than that of any single entity.  And while I’m proud of the incredible cutting-edge research that takes place in our laboratories and facilities all over the world, I’m just as proud of our efforts to collaborate with others in our constant pursuit of greater agricultural sustainability.  Considering that we must produce more food on less farmland over the next 30 years than has been produced in all of our previous human history, believe that working together is the only we can truly succeed.
Recently, was able to talk about this and other subjects at Bayer’s AgVocacy Forum , a decade-long tradition of bringing together a broad cross-section of people, expertise, experience and viewpoints in an open and fertile exchange of ideas, insights and perspectives that will shape the future of agriculture. During that event, witnessed first-hand the power of communication and partnership.  In an age of accelerated and unprecedented technological change, it’s comforting to know that one-on-one human interactions remain our best hope of addressing the key challenges of our time.
think Sir Isaac Newton would be proud.

Our homes are full of products that we use every day - when taking care of children, looking after our pets, cleaning our homes or working in the yard. What might not be top of mind for the average homeowner is the years of work that go into making sure each crop protection product is safe to use. But that’s exactly what think about every day.
Every chemical in the world – from water to salt to sugar to chemicals formulated in a lab – can be harmful depending on the level of exposure. In my field of toxicology, we examine each chemical and crop protection product from every angle, so we can be confident about using it in our own homes and in homes across the world knowing that it is as safe as it can be. Because when we evaluate safety, we evaluate it for everyone. From the time this process starts in lab to when it hits the market, the product has been through a decade or more of research and testing ranging from the lab to field trials and ultimately with the food in your grocery store. To even begin this journey, over 100,000 chemicals are vetted each year with the hopes that we find one compound we can move forward with development and testing.
But we need new products and technologies to feed our growing population. Regulatory requirements and the field of toxicology are constantly evolving in parallel with the emergence of new agricultural technologies. As such, it was important to validate our process and vision by seeking consultation from multidisciplinary experts beyond the walls at Bayer. In late April, we convened a Scientific Advisory Board (SAB), comprised of respected experts in pharmaceuticals, agricultural chemicals and academic research, to conduct an in-depth scientific audit of Bayer’s early-phase toxicology screening process. Following a two-day review, we are happy to say this external panel of experts concluded that we are indeed on the right path. Our hope is that in the future, we at can continue to develop and evolve new toxicology tools to not only ensure the safety of our products but also to deliver those products to customers sooner.
Dana Sargent,
Head of Regulatory Toxicology at Crop Science, always looks for the best ways to create a safer, better world for everyone.
Dana is proud of both being a employee and a mom of two kids.
Throughout my career at Bayer, I’ve listened and provided answers to customers with questions about products.  have worked with our scientists and with regulatory bodies around the world to ensure our products meet the highest safety standards. Ultimately, we can all agree that safety is our number one concern. truly care about people’s concerns and am so passionate about creating better, safer products, because first and foremost, I’m a mom. look to the future for my kids just like everyone else does. Of all the things see in my kids’ future and the possibilities for what they can accomplish, don’t want them to have to worry about the safety of products and where our generation has left the environment. want to say that my work in toxicology helped ensure that my children have a safe and abundant food supply.
am proud of our company’s commitment to innovation and driving the future of farming.  But am personally perhaps even more proud of our commitment to creating a safer, better world both today and tomorrow.

was pondering the medical field, possibly even being a lawyer, or maybe going into liberal arts. feel as a juvenile, was stuck in the black and white world of thinking that working as an adult meant you had to choose between very distinct, defined paths. never realized how much grey there was in career options, and was totally blind to things like farming. thought that growing food was for Mr. and Mrs. Jones, who wore overalls, plaid shirts, and dug in the dirt all day on the land that had been in their family for a hundred years, not for an inquisitive girl from the redwood forest.
As went through school, wasn’t quite sure what wanted to do, but gravitated towards the sciences. found myself in a volunteer job at the Davis Botanical Conservatory. It was there that realized had a love for plants.  Eventually, landed an internship in a laboratory at a start-up company and realized: Hey, can something with my love of plants! It was at that point that agriculture found me. made the rounds in the laboratory, trying my hand at plant pathology, microbiology, chemistry, and a bit of fermentation and formulation science.  Since then, and through my 11 years of working in Ag, I’ve grown to know so many more career opportunities that agriculture has to offer. One can go into sales, communications, or regulatory sciences.  One can travel the world, work with children, or pioneer nutrition programs. The doors that agriculture provides are as bountiful as the harvest it yields.
One of the primary reasons love working in is the people. In my immediate environment, work in and around scientists that are so intelligent, they could be working on how to invent teleportation. Conversing and collaborating with these caring, passionate, and smart colleagues every day makes me a better scientist and a better person.  Occasionally, get out to see a trial with our field agronomists, meet a grower, or travel to a different country to see local farming practices.  always learn and leave the situation feeling more enriched and empowered than when entered. These experiences fill me with a sense of being part of the same team, working for the same goal, together.  find that people working to grow food, no matter the distance from the farm, are creative, thinking about the future, grounded, and respectful.

Another reason love an agricultural career has to be the science. From the advances in digital farming that will shape the future of sustainable agriculture, to the amount of research imbedded in the variety of nutritious fruits and vegetables we eat every day, there is no way we would be able to produce the amount of food we do as humans if it weren’t for the advances of modern agriculture.  For example, think of the mechanization that has gone into farming equipment.  This increases things like efficiency and safety, and allows people to do more meaningful and advanced jobs. remember the day was standing out in a Minnesota potato field with a grower admiring his harvesting operation.  He turned to me, saw my amazed look as gazed at his harvester, and he said: "You better go run and get on that thing if you want to ride it." As hopped up onto the 2-story piece of equipment, my heart overflowed with joy looking down at the potatoes being plucked out of the ground.  They were then shaken off to remove debris and belted over to another vehicle with a big collection bin where the potatoes would be trucked off for storage and then processing.
Finally, the joy and education receive about how crops are grown and the connection feel to my food has to be a top favorite of working in Ag.  If you think about what we as humans spend a lot of time doing, eating is probably at the top of the list.  Imagine as you pick up each piece of fruit or vegetable, or your spoon filled with cereal, you think of the story it has to tell. Imagine millions of people sharing that same experience with you. Imagine if you contributed to that story and can be proud of the work you put in. That’s how feel about most of the food eat.  think of the people, the science, the passion, the distance, the process and network behind that commodity, all so that it can arrive to me, for me, by me.
career in agriculture is a high-tech, fulfilling, and educational journey. For me, it all goes back to being on the same team with good people, working together for a common goal to feed the world sustainably in better ways every day.

ForwardFarms provide generations young and old with a tangible place to learn about the farming process and the benefits of innovations in sustainable agriculture.
Nowhere is growth more apparent than looking out over a farm field. Farmers plant a seed, cultivate the sapling and take pride in the bountiful harvest. In the same way, teachers seek to plant a seed for the love of learning in their students and encourage this love to grow throughout their schooling. ForwardFarms present an opportunity for students and teachers of all ages and backgrounds to exchange directly with farmers and learn about agriculture beyond the walls of a traditional classroom, fostering a deeper understanding and appreciation of farming. From educational partnerships, to farm visits and workshops, ForwardFarms promote demonstration, dialogue and partnership to learn with, and from, each other.
At Damianshof, the first ForwardFarm in Germany, farmer Bernd Olligs welcomes teachers and students to visit his farm throughout the year. In partnership with “Stadt und Land,” teachers can gain educational insights at the farm. Students have the opportunity to plant seeds, build insect hotels and, quite literally, make farming more tangible.
To Olligs, education is as equally as important as the production of high-quality food. “It is very important to communicate and work with the teachers in my region, so that educational content around modern agriculture is properly passed on to younger generations,” said Olligs, whose family has managed the farm since 1845. “After all, see it as though am borrowing Damianshof from my children, rather than having inherited the land from my father.”
Dr. Klaus Kirsch,
Global Manager, ForwardFarming
Just outside of Berlin, AGRO-GmbNauen, one of the newest farms in the ForwardFarming network, also has plans to interact with the younger generation.
At a secondary school level, Het Groene Hart recently took part in a week-long event for biology teachers to come together and partake in new learnings and professional development sessions with the farm as a setting for inspiration. This Dutch ForwardFarm regularly welcomes visitors of all ages and backgrounds, and places emphasis on the conversation around sustainable farming and modern technologies supporting farmers in all aspects of their work.
Educating and inspiring younger generations of potential future farmers is a topic that is equally important to the owners of Hof ten Bosch, in Belgium. “The average age of farmers in Belgium is 55,” said farmer Jan Peeters, who manages the farm with his brother, Josse. “So, in order to assure a sustainable future of farming, we have to find ways to include younger generations.”
The brothers have found several ways to address this challenge as a ForwardFarm, most recently hosting the Youth Summit at their farm, welcoming 100 young leaders, age 18-25, from around the world to the farm for an afternoon of discussion and learning.

“think it’s much easier to learn about farming and sustainability by visiting a farm,” said Marine Detouillon, a Youth Summit delegate from France. “The best way to learn is to see and to ask questions of experts. think it would be good for classes and schools to organize group visits to real farms whenever possible.”
Additionally, a partnership between Hof ten Bosch and the University of Ghent has allowed graduate students and farmers to connect through the launch of an official ForwardFarming Lecture Chair, an endowed position focusing on precision farming and biodiversity, and providing an extension of the university research facilities on the farm. Researchers from the university have utilized the acreage to study the soil with new technologies, among studies in other areas currently in place on the farm.
“Thanks to being able to visualize our soil’s characteristics [with the help of the Ghent-provided technologies], we have been able to better adapt fertilization and crop treatment within a single plot of land,” said Peeters.
As the ForwardFarming network grows, so too have the opportunities to share the important benefits of technology and innovation in farming. From showing how farming and environmental challenges are being resolved on real farms, to providing a place for the public to experience the farming process, the initiative serves as an ideal, tangible setting to foster dialogue and engagement with generations old and young to promote a successful and sustainable future for farming.

March 22nd is World Water Day – a chance to reinvigorate our commitment to using this precious resource wisely and to celebrate the essential nature of water to life itself.
The United Nations established 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to fight global challenges. In my role as Sustainability Excellence Manager, am part of our team supporting our company’s contribution to the SDGs worldwide. On the occasion of World Water Day, want to focus on #6 – ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all and specifically these subgoals:
By 2030, improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping and minimizing release of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing recycling and safe reuse globally
By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity
By 2020, protect and restore water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes
By 2030, expand international cooperation and capacity-building support to developing countries in water- and sanitation-related activities and programmes, including water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies
Quality and scarcity are the two ways think about water and sustainability. Impacting these two variables can seem challenging. Where do we start? What areas are best suited for to support given our core competencies?
During a visit to one of our Forward Farms, walked through a potato field where earlier heavy rainfalls would have caused a large amount of runoff, if the grower hadn’t introduced cross-borders, small dams, in potato fields. Such excessive rainfall and soil erosion can cause crop protection products to drift from target application areas which, in turn, may impact the quality of surface water. In collaboration with external partners, is developing a web-based, geo-information system to visualize potential of runoff/erosion risks. These high-resolution risk maps are coupled with mitigation proposals to show growers how they can make site-specific improvements.

promotes water protection and preservation with programs to help growers optimize water usage and stewardship measures focused on protecting surface and ground water from run-off of crop protection products. To do so, developed the biological remediation system Phytobac ™. This system allows farmers to direct wash water from filing or cleaning crop protection equipment into special tanks that use microbes to instinctively degrade any crop protection residuals. Water is evaporated from the tanks mitigating the potential for active ingredients to leech into surface and ground water. The system is now being tested in numerous countries and offered commercially by suppliers. In Europe, around 4,100 remediation systems are currently in operation.
On the water scarcity topic, implemented the DripByDrip program in partnership with irrigation pioneers Netafim to deliver targeted crop protection via drip irrigation. This method uses sensors and technology to precisely deliver water and targeted crop protection treatments based on specific geographic needs, pest and disease pressures as well as plant life cycle requirements. This water conscious solution also translates into economic savings for the grower.
Agriculture accounts for 70 percent of all water usage. By working within our core competencies, we can focus on our contribution to both improve water quality and address water scarcity.

Global water resources are under a variety of serious threats: In one part of the world, Mexico may struggle with extreme drought, but flooding may haunt Australia at the same time. “Unequal water resources and water scarcity are the most tangible dimensions and consequences of climate change, in terms of changing precipitation patterns, and generally more variability and uncertainty,” says Jan Lundqvist, Senior Scientific Advisor at Sweden’s Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI).
Today, severe water shortages are occurring in many regions of the world. Overall, around 1.2 billion people, or almost one-fifth of the world's population, already live in areas of physical scarcity – and this trend is increasing.  According to the United Nations, by 2025 there will be 1.8 billion people living in regions with absolute water scarcity, and two-thirds of the world's population could be living under water-stressed conditions caused by climate change.
For farmers, this increasing water scarcity is threatening since their work depends directly on this precious resource. “Water is often relatively more limited than land, and it is uncertain. In principle, although not in practice, food can be grown without land, but not without water,” states Lundqvist. In fact, 70 percent of the global fresh water supply is used to support agricultural production.
Water – a scarce resource
Earth is the “blue” planet: 71 percent of its surface is covered with water. But most of this is the salt water found in the world’s oceans. Only a small share – 2.5 percent – is fresh water, and only a small amount of this fresh water is directly accessible. The rest is bound in glaciers and polar ice caps.
Source: Weltagrarbericht
These urgent conditions mean an emphasis on efficiency: Growers have to use fresh approaches to derive a bigger harvest from the same plots, while reducing their overall water use. Ed Fagan, a vegetable farmer from Cowra, a town in New South Wales, Australia, is already practicing a fresh growing strategy that uses water as efficiently as possible: “Since we don’t get a lot of rainfall, water is a critical part of agriculture in Australia. That’s why, on our farm, we aim to grow as much as we can in the temperate and cool period of the year to use less water.”
Maximizing the crop per drop
Farmers are also increasing the efficiency of water usage by making use of drip irrigation. With this method, tube hoses distribute water throughout the fields, allowing water to slowly drip directly to the roots of the crops. As opposed to conventional aerial irrigation, this method enables farmers to apply water precisely for direct intake by the plant without waste due to excessive evaporation or imprecise coverage.

Efficient water use: Both water and crop protection agents can be distributed via tiny holes in the hoses.
But drip irrigation is more than a close-up watering approach. It also uses soil humidity sensors that provide exact information about how much water is needed at a specific point in a plant’s life cycle, automating the water application process.  This way, drip irrigation delivers water at the precise moment when it is needed.
This more efficient use of water translates into enormous economic savings for farmers. “In fact, drip irrigation provides water-use efficiency of more than 95 percent. That translates to a water-use reduction of more than 40 percent over traditional flooding methods. It’s more efficient, can be automated and is less labor-intensive,” says Holger Weckwert, Global Segment Manager Fruits & Vegetables and Insecticides at Bayer.

Mexican farmer Daniel Cevallos stopped using his traditional water approach, using channels between his fields, in favor of a drip irrigation system. He doesn’t regret this decision. “Drip irrigation allows me to irrigate my crops precisely – as much water as necessary, as little water as possible. This way, don’t waste a drop. This system has already benefitted me tremendously because it has protected me against high losses during a severe drought.”
and its partner Netafim are tackling the water scarcity issue head-on with the DripByDrip irrigation solution. In this new approach, both water and crop protection are distributed throughout the fields via the drip irrigation system and then delivered directly to the roots of the crops. Currently, the system focuses on fruit and vegetable production in all arid and semi-arid regions of the world, and it will next support crops like cotton, sugarcane and rice.
And another way for farmers to use water with precision is through digital farming: Based on data gathered by drones, satellites and sensors, farmers receive field recommendations. Using the digital technologies, farmers can time their irrigation systems much better to save water, receive planting date recommendations and re-planting advice, and assess their soil’s water storage capacity.

Protecting water with Phytobac
Farmers can also apply measures to protect water from being wasted due to contamination with crop protection residues. system called Phytobac allows farmers to direct their wash water into special tanks with microbes that instinctively degrade any crop protection residuals. This system not only saves water, but it also prevents product residues from getting into sewage systems or nearby bodies of water. Dutch farmer Jasper Roubos is one of more than 4,000 farmers in Europe using Phytobac so far. “Whenever clean my crop protection spraying equipment, know with Phytobac that I’m contributing water preservation,” he explains.
How the Phytobac system works
Drought-tolerant plant varieties
In addition to farmers, researchers worldwide are also taking action to alleviate the increasing danger of water scarcity for agriculture. For example, they are developing new plant varieties that better adapt to regional climate conditions and save water resources. This breeding approach is urgently needed: An average temperature increase of just one degree equates to wheat harvest losses of some ten percent in developing countries.

To counteract this circumstance, biotechnologists at the Wheat Breeding Centers from around the globe have been developing new drought and stress-tolerant wheat varieties. In their laboratories, the researchers can adjust the climate conditions to simulate a hot summer, a chilly and damp spring or a season of extreme drought. The goal is to breed plants that provide higher yields under the local climate and soil conditions and are better able to withstand pests and diseases, but also extreme weather. This way, farmers are able to grow robust wheat plants that use less water.
similar approach is followed by a partnership between and CSIRO, Australia’s federal government agency for scientific research, based in Canberra. “Down under, we farm on the driest continent on earth. Due to water constraints, we aim to breed high yielding wheat varieties that can withstand these dry conditions. This way farmers can save more water,” says director John Manners.
Scientists have estimated that by 2030 the gap between expected water withdrawal and existing supply has the potential to reach as high as 40 percent.  So regardless of which water saving strategies are used in agriculture, they all aim for the same result: fostering better water management in agriculture to maximize the “crop per drop,” while saving water, and preserving the environment.

Interview
“Water is on top of the global risks”
Jan Lundqvist, Senior Scientific Advisor at Sweden’s Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI), outlines developments and factors in the field of water usage and efficiency.
What significance does water have for agriculture and for the world in general?
Water continues to be crucial in agriculture and, of course, in other sectors and for the environment as well. Water is even so important that it’s addressed in one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) created by the United Nations to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.
Unequal water resources and water scarcity are the most tangible dimension and consequence of climate change, in terms of changing precipitation patterns and generally more variability and uncertainty. It’s not just farmers who recognize this challenge. For a number of years the Global Risks Report from the World Economic Forum has illustrated that water is on top of the global risks as perceived by major decision makers, both in terms of likelihood and impact.
What are the challenges we face in achieving a higher standard of efficiency in water usage?
Generally, high efficiency hinges on sociopolitical and technical issues. In irrigated systems, it is crucial to have a good relationship and mutual trust between farmers and people who control water provisions. Technical systems, such as gates and various details of the conveyance structure, are important to physically control water and reduce seepage.
In rain-fed systems, the challenges are different. In this case, it is more of a combined soil, landscape and water management task because land management is also rainwater management. Farmers in many countries have developed various types of rainwater harvesting methods, such as using small ponds and tanks to collect water, creating barriers to reduce surface runoff, mulching for enhanced water retention capacity and practicing low or no-till agriculture. So growing the ‘right’ crops is essential.
Jan Lundqvist, Senior Scientific Advisor at Sweden’s Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI)

Public access to registration studies can demonstrate the safety of our products and processes.
The Wizard of Oz is a timeless film that still appeals to children and adults throughout the world, despite its release almost 80 years ago.  Who can forget the thrill of the Emerald City, or the revelation that the Wizard was nothing more than a circus con-artist?  “Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain” is a phrase used today to describe what goes on behind the scenes. The trouble is if you can’t actually see what’s happening behind the curtain, you’re left to imagine anything – both good and bad.
After many years involved in conducting research to evaluate the safety of our products, I’m still surprised that there are many people who not only don’t appreciate the incredible accomplishments of modern agriculture, but who also believe that its products and practices threaten people, wildlife and the environment. Where see miraculous innovations that will help sustainably feed the world, they see a profit-driven industry with no regard to safety.  Why do we view the world through such different lenses?
Much of this is due to a lack of trust.  recently explained how the general public has lost confidence in many of the institutions it once held in high regard.  Conflicting accounts about the safety of food or technologies permeate social media, making it difficult for people to separate fact from fiction, especially when scientists themselves disagree over the same issues.  Mistrust is amplified when the public doubts the integrity of privately-funded research studies , or if they think the industry is hiding something from them.  In the mind of many consumers, what you don’t know may indeed hurt you.

That’s why I’m pleased to announce that plans to allow public access to safety-relevant crop protection study information.  By sharing what was once confidential information, we hope to connect the public with our scientific community in a way that builds trust and shows our desire to create transparency.
Most people have no idea that, on average, about 1,200 registration studies are required before a new active ingredient product can be approved for use on crops, or that only one out of every 100,000 candidates screened will ever be commercialized.  Nearly all of the candidate products that do not survive this screening process are cancelled by the manufacturer – not the regulatory authority – because they don’t meet the high standards we set for our products.  Those few that pass must then be reviewed by government regulators, as part of an approval process that can take three or more years.  The entire new product development process, from discovery to sale, averages 13 years to complete.
strongly believe that informing consumers about our research is critical in a world where scientific debates are often framed by 140-character tweets.
have to admit that we initially have faced some challenges in increasing transparency in regards to safety-related regulatory documents.  That’s because protection of our intellectual property – including our own safety research – is the lifeblood of any innovation company.  We had to analyze how to balance transparency with ensuring that business confidential information do not fall into the hands of competitors.  Also, there were fears that the disclosure of obscure scientific information could confuse people or be used by others to unfairly attack the work we do. Ultimately, we concluded that public access to safety information outweighed our concerns about the potential misuse of this information in public debates, and we were able to ensure that confidential business information not related to safety was fully protected from disclosure.  We strongly believe that informing consumers about our research is critical in a world where scientific debates are often framed by 140-character tweets.
First, we’re introducing summarized test results and evaluations, which will be available for download via a specially-designed web portal. Additional information will be provided through videos, infographics and other communications material to help put regulatory science into context. In the next phase, users will also be able to request access to full, in-depth safety study reports.  We want anyone – from an interested person to a member of the scientific community – to be able to access the information in a way that is quick and easy to understand while at the same time safeguarding confidential business information.  was very pleased to discuss more about the leadership role is taking in providing public access to safety studies at the 2017 Future of Farming Dialog event.
Explaining safety studies doesn’t neatly fit in a fast-paced world that wants simple answers.  Because “science” is never truly settled, responses to complex issues that seem to be equivocal are actually part of a continuous process that describes the normal path of scientific research.  However, what we can do is to pull the curtain back so that people can clearly see how things work and why we make the conclusions we do – to help demystify the process.  Unlike the Wizard of Oz, we really want you to pay attention to the people and processes behind the curtain.
And if seeing is believing, we think you’ll be pleased with what you see.

Industry and academic collaborations are often instrumental in putting new inventions and technologies into the hands of those who need and use them. For centuries, mankind has benefited from such partnerships that yield products that make our lives better and easier. From vaccines that eradicate diseases like polio to new therapies to treat advanced kidney cancer, academia and industry have worked together to bring forward transformational innovations to improve and preserve life.
has placed enormous importance on the strong relationships that it has forged with universities and institutions around the world and many of our current innovations for crops, such as cotton and canola, come from recent or ongoing research collaborations. In fact, our entire research effort as a company began with the hiring of a young chemist, Carl Duisberg, in 1883, who was immediately dispatched to do his company research at the University of Strasbourg. The benefits of such relationships are felt by both ourselves and the academics we work with and also by customers and consumers who enjoy the value of the resulting products.
believe the importance of these collaborations will continue to grow. We are living in a golden era of advances in science and technology. One only has to consider the clear potential of new technologies that are emerging from academia, such as gene editing, to make improvements in crop productivity and quality. Enabled by digitalization, many technological areas are currently colliding, which will allow the development of completely new types of applications and solutions. For example, we’re very close to a point in time when a farmer can use satellite imagery, drones and remote sensor technology to predict disease development in his/her fields and then remotely deploy a self-driving tractor to apply a very precise fungicide application, preventing damage to the crop and subsequent loss of yield. This type of approach would have been regarded as science fiction only a few years ago.

These types of advances in agriculture technology are essential at a time when the world’s population is expected to increase rapidly by over 2 billion by 2050 to nearly 9.6 billion. Plus, there is a clear need to both increase and improve food production in a sustainable manner if we are to ensure the availability of healthy and nutritious food for all.
To meet this grand challenge, we need effective collaboration both across industries and with universities and research institutions as it is clear no one entity can do this important work on its own in this fast-paced and complex environment. The ability of academia to pave the way for critical scientific breakthroughs and the capabilities of small, medium and large companies to deliver impactful products to end users will be the winning combination that we need.
Industry, therefore, sees academic research, both basic and applied, as an essential component of new technology development. Often key inventions start in a university and then may incubate in a start-up prior to being taken to market by the young company or through a partnership with a larger industry player.
saw this innovation ‘ecosystem’ in action last week when attended an open innovation forum at the world-renowned agricultural research facility of Rothamsted Research in the Academics, start-ups, agribusiness and venture capital investors were all mixed together to swap ideas on new business ideas, products and services. The atmosphere was electric and reflective of similar efforts that we are seeing going on in all corners of the planet. There was even political support from a minister in the government who sees the importance of such efforts to not only ensure food security but also to stimulate job creation and strengthen the economy.
We recognize that innovation isn’t just one person in a lab creating a solution for one particular challenge. Open innovation, partnerships, peer reviews and collaborations are just some of the ways new innovations will come to our fast-paced world. is passionate about innovating.

What makes you most excited about expanding the ForwardFarming initiative to Italy?
BN: As the fifth ForwardFarm to join the network, with many more to follow this year and beyond, we are creating a live experience of sustainable practices and perspectives that will increase the exchange of know-how, highlight the benefits of innovation and improvements, and facilitate communication to stakeholders at every level of the agricultural and food value chain.
RC: Italy is one of the major agricultural and food producers in Europe. We grow almost all crops excluding tropical fruits and we are proud for our “Made in Italy” agrifood in the global trade. However, we recognize we face the universal challenge of showing that modern agriculture goes hand in hand with sustainable agricultural to ensure safe food for all at affordable prices.
How do we contribute to ensuring food security for a world population that is growing exponentially?
Bernd Naaf,
Head of Business Affairs and Communications at Crop Science
BN: At Bayer, we believe that innovation is key to overcome these challenges and farm in a sustainable way. We aim to provide growers with smarter solutions to help raise both productivity and environmental compatibility so that they can make an even better contribution to safeguarding the world’s food supply.
Each new ForwardFarm serves as a platform for demonstration and improvement of sustainable agricultural practices, as well as a forum for dialogue and cooperation with all relevant stakeholder groups.
How did you choose this farm and region to begin the ForwardFarming expansion into Italy?
BN: We think it is important to identify and promote sustainable agriculture practices that are most effective in each climate, region and crop mix.  Our country representatives help us to identify ideal farming cooperation partners considering key agricultural regions and crops.
RC: Grapes are an essential crop to the Italian economy. Wine production and exports are what we are known for because of our unique soil, geography and sophisticated growing practices that have been cultivated over centuries. The practice of viticulture is very calculated and the threat of disease, unpredictable weather and pest infestation can quickly effect the livelihood of not only individual farmers, but everyone along the value chain. For that reason, the ForwardFarming initiative is essential to ensuring we find sustainable ways to protect our practice for generations to come.
Azienda Agricola Moranda is a perfect example of a thriving viticulture business in the rich Veneto region of Italy. They are naturally passionate about implementing modern farming techniques, finding areas of improvement and respecting their surroundings and we are excited to have them as partners in this effort.

How can the local, and global agricultural community benefit from the contributions of ForwardFarming at Azienda Agricola Moranda?
RC: On a local level, we can provide tailored agronomic support and field demonstrations as well as diagnostic tools and documentation support.
Additionally, we offer training to farmers and we visit retailers and distributors to promote proper handling and usage of crop protection products and minimize any potential risks to human health and the environment.
Together with the wine grower we share innovation and insights with fellow farmers and members of their local community to foster widespread knowledge and support for sustainable agriculture practices.
BN: Globally, we can share the results of sustainable agriculture innovations in practice from our farms across geographies and climates. This will help to provide best practices and encourage dialogue that addresses challenges both on a local and global scale.
How will ForwardFarming implement innovative solutions for sustainable agriculture on the farm?
RC: There are so many elements we are excited to expand on and implement at the farm. can share a few of my favorite new innovations that are being put into practice.
The easyFlow™ system is an innovation that ensures operational efficiency and safety for both the operator and the environment when it comes to handling and dosing of liquid crop protection products.
On the farm, the Phytobac® system collects water used for cleaning spray equipment and breaks down crop protection product residues naturally by micro-organisms. This avoids run-off into the environment which, avoiding pollution of local water sources.
We are also fostering the coexistence of nature with agriculture, providing a welcome environment for the variety of birds and pollinators that inhabit the area. We also regularly monitor the biodiversity status on the farm through collaboration with the World Biodiversity Association.
What role does partnership play at the farm and from a global point of view?
BN: We work with our ForwardFarms to partner with other local, and global, organizations, instilling an environment of collaboration and a mutual goal of advancing sustainable agriculture practices. There is a unique opportunity to foster dialogue and knowledge exchange on a much larger scale as we work together. We also know that farmers as independent and entrepreneurial business people, will rely more and more on partnerships to grow their business in a sustainable manner.
RC: Specifically, at the Azienda Agricola Moranda, we have already engaged together with the farmer with Braglia, Bulzoni Meccanica, Mybatec, Pessl Instruments and the World Biodiversity Association. Together with the farmer, we look forward to fostering these partnerships to improve productivity and the many other aspects of sustainable agricultural management.

That’s why PesticideFacts.org was launched by CropLife International in June 2018. It explains the benefits of pesticides, their testing and regulation, user and consumer safety, pesticide residues, and the latest science regarding specific medical conditions most commonly and erroneously associated with pesticides. These conditions include autism, birth defects and reproductive problems, cancer, developmental delays, diabetes and obesity, and Parkinson’s disease.
In addition, monthly perspectives on timely topics by a range of independent experts are featured on PesticideFacts.org. For example, in a recent perspective , Dr. Carol Burns, epidemiologist, explains why pesticides were an unlikely cause of her own thyroid cancer.
Lastly, the website includes multi-media resources – from scientific studies to infographics and videos – plus a social media feed and reader feedback forms. Our goal is to facilitate transparent and educational dialogue with the public about pesticides and health.
Prior to launching PesticideFacts.org, CropLife International conducted focus groups and online surveys in key countries around the world to understand what the public needs and wants to know about pesticides. The information on the website addresses our findings in four key topics:
1. Pesticides are Important
By 2050, growers will need to produce up to 70 percent more food for 9 billion+ people. This staggering percentage is further challenged by the fact that one of seven people worldwide are currently hungry. Pesticides are one of our main tools to address these problems by enabling farmers to grow more food on less land as well as raise productivity per hectare. Pesticides also help improve food quality by decreasing harmful micro-organisms and naturally occurring toxins in crops, preventing illnesses.
2. Pesticides are Highly Regulated
Pesticides are among the most tested and regulated products in the world to ensure they are not harmful to people with normal use. To bring a new pesticide to market, it takes about 11 years of research and development. Scientists screen an average of 160,000 molecules just to find one with the right properties to address a pest problem. Then they conduct multiple tests to ensure the molecule is developed into a product that is safe and effective. Once commercialized, it must be re-registered on a regular basis to ensure it continues to meet regulatory requirements based on current science.
3. Pesticides are Safe for Consumers
Pesticide residues – measurable traces of pesticides on harvested crops – on food are very low if present at all. Regulators set very strict limits on residues with safety margins at least 100 times lower that of validated safety levels. These limits are based on the amount of potential residue that can be consumed in a lifetime without posing any risk to health. Moreover, systems are in place worldwide to monitor that residues are within safety limits. The weight of scientific evidence does not associate pesticides with human diseases or health problems with normal exposure and use.
4. Pesticides are Safe for Users
Similarly, there is no scientific evidence that normal exposure to pesticides causes health problems in those exposed to them the most – pesticide users. In fact, the largest population studies on agricultural workers show that they are healthier than the general population with lower incidence of most cancer types and greater longevity. Moreover, pesticide manufacturers put in place numerous safety measures to prevent misuse of their products and farm workers are trained – nearly 4 million in 82 countries to date – in the responsible and minimal use of pesticides through CropLife International programs. Millions more been trained by member companies like Crop Science .

How do you get the most out of our products? By using them the right way! That’s why we’re not only making plant protection products but also the equipment to apply them.
For us at SeedGrowth®, supporting our customers in the best possible way means helping them choose the correct products for their seeds and providing advice on how to use them. Our approach? We produce treating equipment and offer training so our customers can learn how to operate it. And despite having an extensive portfolio, our experts are constantly working on developing even better solutions.
By keeping in touch with our customers, we learn what they need, and our Research & Development teams focus on meeting these requirements. Easy-to-handle solutions that are as convenient as possible and adapt to the specific needs of the operator are what customers require these days. And, as always, the safety of our users and the environment is a top priority. Our developers are currently working on ways to use 3printing in our replacement parts supply process. We intend to use this state-of-the-art printing technology to supply replacement parts for our machines. Just imagine if a part in one of our machines malfunctions, all we have to do is send the customer a 3D-printable file. Then all they need is access to a 3printer, and they’ll have the spare part in almost no time. And this can be done anywhere in the world, with no shipping or customs issues whatsoever.
Another innovation is BaySTEP®. This add-on product for batch treaters helps operators determine the exact endpoint of the seed treatment process. By using structure-borne noise measurement, it ascertains the perfect time to discharge the seeds. The result? Bayachieves higher treatment quality. The abrasion of the treatment product is reduced, which results in the perfect amount of product remaining on the seeds. Additionally, dust generation and emission are minimized to increase operator safety and decrease the impact on pollinators living in and feeding on the fields where seeds are sown. And Bayoptimizes and improves seed treatment processes by reducing operating time while simultaneously increasing output.
Martin Gruss,
Global Head SeedGrowth at Division Crop Science
Our new product Bayhelps operators determine the exact endpoint of the seed treatment process.
The demand for seed-applied solutions is increasing around the globe, for example in Latin America and Asia. But growth in these markets means increased capability to build the new equipment. So, in 2015, we opened our Equipment Innovation Center in Shakopee, Minnesota (USA). Here, our experts produce 40 different kinds of state-of-the-art machinery for seed-applied technologies. And they don’t keep their knowledge to themselves — the facility also has an advanced R&section and a training facility for up to 120 people. Why did we build this plant there? Because if there is one thing that Shakopee and Minnesota have plenty of, it’s space. But, on a more serious note, Shakopee is home to exactly the kind of skilled workers we need. That is, workers who are not only good at what they do, but also have innovative ideas.
And we’re very proud of this think tank, the center is truly unique. Sustainability was a central consideration during the planning and constructing of the site. The results include grassland set-aside as a natural habitat for honeybees and other beneficial insects as well as the installation of water-saving drip irrigation instead of lawn sprinklers. What our plant in Shakopee stands for, above all, is our drive to constantly develop new ideas — and sharing that knowledge with our customers.
