Technologies like AI, cloud, blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT) are changing the world. But only if they can be effectively trained, trusted and applied.
Together with our clients, is putting smart to work.
In 30 years, the world’s population is estimated to grow ahead of what our food supply can support.
Watson Ioanalyzes a variety of data like temperature, soil pand other agricultural and environmental                  factors to give farmers insights that can help them make better decisions — and harvest greater yields.
Aviation
The aviation industry is working with to put decades of maintenance insight at the fingertips of employees.
Using Watson technology to cross-analyze various data — including previous problems and successful                  solutions — maintenance personnel can help diagnose problems faster and with more confidence, creating smoother flights.
Automotive
The age of the intelligent vehicle is here. It's now possible for automakers to create                  immersive, connected experiences for drivers and passengers.
For example, autonomous vehicles combine Watson technologies — such as natural                  spoken language with location and weather data collected by Iosensors — to get passengers                  safely to their desired destinations, provide recommendations for places to visit                  and answer questions about their surroundings.
Banking
Customers demand the choice of how, when and where they do their banking. To keep up, banks need to improve the customer experience with faster service, reduced wait times and first-time problem resolution.
An                   AI-based virtual assistant — built with Watson — is helping to change the game in call center innovation.
Most industries are disrupted by people. Energy, Environment, and Utilities is disrupted by forces of nature.
This industry is working with to use weather and other data to better help anticipate natural                    occurrences before they happen, and to identify strategies to mitigate damage and avoid blackouts.
Environment
Rampant poaching in South Africa is threatening the extinction of rhinoceroses.
In response, rangers are putting Watson Iosensors on zebras and impalas — who run when threats are near — to help locate and                    capture poachers.
Consumers expect fast delivery, but paper-based processes burden the shipping industry. Removing these inefficient practices can help make the supply chain faster, more trustworthy and more efficient while supporting security.
is working with transportation companies to use blockchain solutions that give greater visibility into millions of container journeys each year while accelerating the shipping process by eliminating paper documents.
Government leaders are under increasing pressure to digitally transform their organizations. Citizens                    want the same convenience and personalization from government services as from the on-demand economy. And                    elected officials demand operational efficiency, transparency, and protection against growing physical and                    cyber threats.
Technologies — including IoT, AI, blockchain, and advanced analytics — can modernize and                    transform the current way of working, and deliver citizen satisfaction.
Healthcare
For people with diabetes, each day is filled with questions. This, along with                    the growing number of people with diabetes and rising healthcare costs, spurred                    Medtronic to look for new ways to tackle diabetes management.
Medtronic recently introduced a new prediction feature                    for its personal diabetes assistant app Sugar.                    Using AI, IQcast™ aims to predict the likelihood of a low                    glucose event within an upcoming 1-4 hour window so that                    people with diabetes can live their life with greater freedom.
Insurance companies must embrace innovation to stay ahead of increasing competition from both traditional providers and emerging insurtechs.
Insurance uses blockchain, and platform solutions to help insurers                    drive profits by engaging new markets while managing costs. Developed in collaboration with a leading insurance provider, the Insurance Platform can help bring insurance technology into the future with platform economics                    and partner ecosystems.
Manufacturing
The smallest disruptions can cause significant downtime and delays in manufacturing,                    leading to lost customers and big cuts into profit margins. All types of manufacturers                    can improve each step of their process with technologies.
For example, Watson triggers alerts when weather patterns threaten delivery of                    raw materials, and Iosensors and analytics predict equipment failures before they                    occur. With such insights, manufacturers can make adjustments to keep production lines running.

Oil and gas
Oil and data are two of the world’s most valuable resources and their futures are intertwined.
Oil and gas companies are working with to build and train Watson solutions to better                     understand the complex systems and equipment used in exploration and production. These                     solutions use data from Iosensors, millions of files, decision logs and evaluations                     from around the world to help engineers make better operational decisions and avoid equipment problems.
Retail
To remain competitive, retailers are looking to improve in all areas, from the store floor to the back office. Retail                     and consumer products companies are working with to personalize customer interactions, understand the neighborhoods they serve, create                     dynamic store experiences and empower their store associates. But no matter the innovation, the customer remains at the center of it all.

Enterprise content management (ECM) solutions enable an organization to take full advantage of the customer information and company knowledge embedded in its content. solutions capture, store, activate, analyze and automate content, providing new value from data that was previously unstructured and unavailable.
When effectively managed across the organization, content can be used to engage customers, automate processes and enhance collaboration.
Why is important for my business?
Content is the currency that fuels and funds digital transformation. Content possesses information about customers — their behaviors, sentiments and value to the organization, but only if you can harness it. Collectively, content buried in repositories, file shares and cloud folders across the enterprise represents the knowledge of the organization. Now, more than ever, an enterprise content strategy is an essential milepost on the journey to becoming a digital business.
As content grows at unprecedented speeds, organizations are taking concrete steps to bring content under control. “Content chaos” — the lack of digitized content and the inability to access the right content at the right time — is one of the most pervasive barriers to becoming a digital business.
How do get started with ECM?
Organizations that are serious about digital transformation need to start with the basics.  First, capture the content at the first opportunity. Next, classify it and apply governance rules. Then, control who can access it, and give people tools to find it quickly. Finally, put the content in motion for processes and collaboration.
Identify the role content plays in your Successful adoption of begins with an assessment of the enterprise. Where are paper-based processes slowing down results? Where is content located in the enterprise: are they in file shares, systems or cloud repositories? And what is your strategy for governance, compliance and document retention?
Select an initial project
solutions are scalable and often start with a department or line-of-application. Once all stakeholders are engaged and have provided input, you develop a vision and measurable goals for the solution and, after thorough testing and user training, deploy the solution. Often, the success of the solution spreads to other departments, which start lobbying to be the next project.
Extend across the enterprise
is best deployed as an enterprise solution. Once the first project has been completed, many elements and procedures can be reused, making subsequent projects less expensive and faster to deploy.  Many businesses develop a shared-services strategy to maximize their investment in people, content and technology.

Foreword
is on the brink of massive disruption. The ubiquity of mobile and social technologies and personalization has redefined the bar for employee experience.                       With the disruption of models across all industries, the talent acquisition game has changed and with the impact of technological change on work, the need for a continuous learning culture has never been more urgent.                       The stands at the intersection of all these demands, generally with a declining budget and ongoing operational distractions.

step change
departments were once primarily administrative functions.
Referred to as personnel departments, the key responsibilities were clerical, and work in the department focused on record keeping about the workforce.                       But the view of Human Resources has evolved considerably in the last 30 years. Research has shown the ways organizations manage their workers have important implications for how well organizations perform.1
Today the phrase ‘strategic HR’ is used to refer to practices that provide a competitive advantage to organizations.2 The strategic movement has seen a shift in HR's focus from administrative practices to                       high performance practices like teamwork and performance management, which focus on key jobs rather than every job and on groups of critical workers rather than every worker.3
Until recently, the primary benefit of technology has been to provide efficiency gains; it allowed us to do the same things we always did, but faster and more cost effectively.4 For example, previously technology allowed us to recruit people faster over the internet, but now lets us recruit the right people faster by assessing skill match for roles, predicting the likelihood of future success, and estimating the expected time to fill any given role.                       This is an example of the ways in which is changing the situation so that technology enables the function to solve critical challenges, building on earlier contributions from workforce analytics. Where previous initiatives led to incremental change, offers the opportunity for exponential performance improvements in HR.

in HR

Today, AI’s capabilities are being used to augment, operations and consumer solutions.
We have identified five primary reasons for implementing in HR:
1. To solve pressing challenges
enables organizations to deliver new insights and services at scale without ballooning headcount or cost.                         Persistent challenges, like having the people resources to deliver on the strategy and allocating financial resources accordingly, can be addressed through the thoughtful application of solutions.
2. To attract and develop new skills
The world is constantly being disrupted. In order to cope with this disruption, businesses need to respond faster to opportunities, and to work in an agile way to stay ahead of competitors.                         This means finding an effective way to compete for the skills required to innovate in this new operating environment.                         applications enable departments to acquire and develop employee skills in lockstep with shifting market demand.
3. To improve the employee experience
People have started to expect something different when they come to work; they want a personalized experience, not a standard one.                         They want things to be tailored and offered to them in a way that works for them from the start to the end of a process.                         Today, people can also look inside a from the outside with sites like Glassdoor, which puts a huge premium on the employee experience.
4. To provide strong decision support
The speed of change and rate at which information is being generated means that decisions today are best made analytically.                         Because the amount of information that needs to be considered is vast, can be used to make sense of it and deliver recommendations.                         As a result, the information managers and employees require is there just when they need it.                         also provides the opportunity for employee voices to be heard and acted upon in real time.
5. To use budgets as efficiently as possible
can enable to become more efficient with its funding. spend can shift to higher value and more complex problem solving, without reducing levels of service for workers who have more routine queries.                         savings made in this way can be reinvested in further deployment, increasing HR’s ability to solve challenges, continuously develop strategic skills, create positive work experiences, and provide outstanding decision support for employees.
An ‘moon shot’
As you read through this paper, we hope you'll keep in mind the idea of a 'moon shot' for applications of in Like President John Kennedy’s 1961 seemingly impossible goal of sending a person to the moon within 10 years when the technology for such a feat did not exist, opens the door to previously unimaginable possibilities. For example, a potential moon shot for driverless cars is the objective of zero accident-related motor vehicle deaths. Applications of in healthcare have the ultimate objective of eradicating diseases. What might the moon shot be for applications of in HR?                       moon shot for in could be that employees are in complete control of their careers because helps their skills evolve at the same speed that technology evolves. In other words, a moon shot could be that helps workers renew their skills before existing skills become obsolete.                       Different organizations will likely have different moon shots for in What is the moon shot in your organization?
How can be used in HR
Deployment of in can occur across the entire talent lifecycle. See figure 1 in the next sections, examples of use cases at each point in the talent lifecycle are outlined.
“Ask yourself: What things would be better if they were done 24/7? What would be better if it were done at scale?  What would benefit from greater consistency?  What would be possible if we leveraged broader expertise to see beyond our current limits?  These are good candidates for AI.”
— Debora Bubb, Vice President and Chief Leadership, Learning & Inclusion Officer, IBM

Attract: Enhancing candidate experience
has been deployed in to identify high quality candidates even prior to job seekers applying for jobs, in the candidate attraction phase.                       During this part of the talent life-cycle, the goal is to source as many potential candidates as possible who have the required skills for a particular position.
“When we piloted for candidate attraction we saw a big increase in candidates applying for jobs at IBM, and there was greater stickiness. In addition, Net Promoter Score feedback said the was engaging. People felt it answered their questions, was relevant and useful.”

Specialized chatbots deployed during candidate attraction offer candidates the opportunity to ask questions that are interpreted and responded to using natural language processing (NLP).                       This technology allows prospective applicants to learn more about the organization before they actually apply, a critical capability in an age where workers do extensive research about companies and brand reputations before applying. It also leads to better job matching compared to more traditional approaches based on keyword searches.
of Talent, Joanna Daly, on the value of in recruiting
has changed the way job seekers engage with Previously, candidates and employers would meet for the first time at the job interview, after learning about the opportunity from an online jobs board or career website.                           By leveraging AI, candidates and employers can now have real-time interaction via a chatbot, resulting in a more personalized application process for job seekers.                           The richer information applicants receive in turn leads to a stronger fit of job applicants for roles.
These chatbots get smarter with every interaction. Videos can also be embedded into the process to give a much more realistic preview of what it's like to work at the organization.                           The end result of implementing these capabilities at has been an increased flow of high potential candidates. In a trial study where was compared to a traditional static website, the conversion from exploring to application for was 36%, versus 12% for the traditional static website.                           Net Promoter Scores (NPS) were also higher for compared to traditional application routes, and the time from application to interview has been dramatically reduced.
“gets 7,000 resumes per day and surfacing the right candidate in a reasonable time is like finding a needle in a haystack. Since implementing WCA, we have dramatically cut time to hire, doubled NPS, and vastly improved the matching of candidates to jobs.”

Efficient and effective recruitment
The job of a recruiter is time pressured and complex, often having to fill many roles at once. Recruiters need to prioritize all of the different roles they are responsible for, and at the same time, they need a way to differentiate among candidates competing for the same role.                       Not meeting these challenges effectively enough can mean the wrong roles get prioritized, and even where the right roles are prioritized, the wrong candidates might be selected for roles.
“Overall, this is a story about data providing you with exponential learning opportunities and better decision-making capabilities. In talent acquisition at IBM, incorporating into the recruiting and sourcing functions augments our recruiters’ ability to make better decisions that drives more value.”
— Amber Grewal, Vice President, Global Talent Acquisition, IBM

can be used in this setting to predict how long a job requisition will take to fill based on historical data, allowing recruiters to reprioritize as needed. can also be used to determine the match between a candidate’s resume and the job requisition,                       and to make accurate predictions of future performance based on information about the candidate collected in the job application process. Furthermore, it can help recruiters write more inclusive job descriptions and filter candidates more effectively, minimizing the impact of unconscious bias in their process and practices.
In a large organization like IBM, effective prioritization of recruitment demands careful selection of applicants. needed a better way to help recruiters surface the top candidates for open jobs and to prioritize the most important requisitions. The solution developed, Watson Recruitment (IWR), uses to leverage information about the job market and past experiences of hiring candidates to predict time to fill and identify the candidates most likely to be successful.
By helping the recruiter prioritize and rank candidate suitability, frees up time to focus on the core of recruiting: building and nurturing relationships with candidates.                           derives required skills from job requisitions and generates a match score against skills described in resumes.                           The solution can also generate a predictive score based on biographical data (whether or not they have led a team) in the resume. These scores predict future job performance. Importantly, monitors hiring decisions to make sure they are free from bias.                           In summary, deploying in the recruitment function allows faster and more accurate hiring, and a better candidate and recruiter experience.

Engage: Enhancing motivation
Two specific uses of that support manager effectiveness are manager talent alerts and engagement analysis. talent alerts are notifications for first line managers about their team members.                       They help managers make decisions about their people, based on a range of information that the application has on each team member and the worker population at an organization.
engagement analysis is technology that can analyze social media content from inside a company. This technology can analyze unstructured content from annual surveys and pulse surveys, as well as social media chatter.                       Hundreds of thousands of comments can be analyzed for themes in a matter of hours. For data privacy reasons it is advisable to limit listening to information within a corporate firewall.
“If we were to read manually through the comments we get in our engagement survey, by the time we finish it would be time for our next survey! Instead we use technology to summarize feedback in a way that’s consumable and leads to suggested actions.”
— Sadat Shami, Director Talent Development, Engagement & Social Analytics, IBM

At IBM, chatter analysis is used to surface the three top issues from social media sources within the company firewall.                           This provides recommendations that are personalized to a specific leader to help improve engagement in their team.                           If an employee received recognition for outstanding work, for example, might recommend to their manager to amplify that feedback by sharing it with others.
has observed that these sorts of actions improve engagement. ‘Engage at IBM’ is an application that learns; the leader provides feedback on the recommendations and the system will improve as a result.                           As the system gets better, so too does the manager's effectiveness at managing and inspiring their teams.
Retain: Smarter compensation planning
Making sound compensation decisions requires careful consideration of a wide range of factors. In addition to performance, these factors include the market rate for the skills, how in demand the skills are, and whether it is better to reward strong performance in base pay or in bonuses. To make optimal base pay decisions that reflect this line of thinking, you need a deep understanding of employee skills, the going rate for those skills, and whether those skills are increasing or decreasing in demand. There can be many more data points that need to be considered than a person can analyze without analytical support.
“If compensation decisions are based on just one or two data points, such as tenure and performance, a manager can make the decision without analytical support.                                 But managers should consider many factors, such as market rates and propensity to learn. With more data points, is needed to avoid underpaying some and overpaying others.”
— Nickle LaMoreaux, Vice President Compensation & Benefits, IBM
“If compensation decisions are based on just one or two data points, such as tenure and performance, a manager can make the decision without analytical support.                                 But managers should consider many factors, such as market rates and propensity to learn. With more data points, is needed to avoid underpaying some and overpaying others.”

The advent of AI-based compensation support can lead to thousands of hours of preparation for compensation cycles being reduced to just a few hours, while providing decision advice that examines many more variables than were previously considered.                       Furthermore, by focusing on skills in determining compensation, the use of minimizes chances that bias exists in the compensation process.
Making complex compensation decisions accurately across an organization is a challenge, and one that uses to address. designed an AI-powered decision support tool that assists with compensation planning, helping managers avoid underweighting or overweighting the critical data points.                           The application reviews dozens of data points in making its recommendations, integrating external information from sources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics with internal data on factors such as cost to replace.                           The application is currently being deployed for tens of thousands of first-line managers to assist with their compensation planning, following successful early trials in focused geographies.
Importantly, when using the tool, managers have the opportunity to override the recommendation about any given employee, and the system can continue to learn from managers’ actual decisions.                           In general, managers tend to follow the recommendations the provides, and this has helped ensure employees are not overpaid or underpaid at                           also emphasizes transparency in AI-based compensation support: employees can see where they sit relative to the market, because the low and high range of compensation for workers with their skills is provided, in addition to their personal salary.
Develop: Personalized learning
“With AI, we are able to see how learning relates to engagement without even having to ask our employees for their perceptions.                                 If managers went to manager training, are their people more engaged? We have the answer and that gives us important feedback on how effective our training is.”
— Gordon Fuller, Vice President and Chief Learning Officer, IBM

in a learning context can help accelerate skill development at the level of the individual, and it can optimize learning at the level of the organization. One of the areas with the most promise is tagging of learning content. In the past, when learners interacted with a learning management system, the content they found depended largely on the descriptions that the developers uploaded with the training in the first place. These descriptions are called metadata. With tagging, resources such as images and documents that are uploaded to learning management systems are enriched with metadata through technologies, and this helps learners locate the training content and use it again and again more efficiently.
The essential components of learning include:
Open learning platform: Integrates employee and learning data from various sources, bringing all relevant content together for access from any device – allowing learning to happen anywhere and at any time.
Employee-specific experience: Provides personalized learning recommendations tailored to job role, group, skill set, and personal learning history – encouraging continuous employee development and skill growth.
Content channels: Learning content is organized to support a variety of needs and interests – resulting in simpler browsing and ongoing development aligned with initiatives.
By making learning easily available when and where it’s needed, helps the acquisition of strategic skills for organizations. can be used to create an overall picture of how the organization is doing in the area of learning in the form of a learning dashboard.                       Dashboards can show progress towards closing identified skill gaps in a business. The learning history of particular individuals in an organization can even be considered an indication of a person's propensity to learn.                       Propensity to learn is becoming just as important as a person's current skills as the shelf-life of skills continues to decrease at a fast rate.
At IBM, the introduction of in learning has produced impressive results. Using AI, has developed Your Learning, a rich, personalized digital marketplace for learning, visited by 98% of employees every quarter. IBMers complete an average of 60 hours of learning per year. IBMers can navigate to the learning most popular with their peers, sign up for targeted learning channels, and explore the skills and badges they need to prepare for the company’s hottest roles. learning chatbot answers questions 24/7. As a result, IBM’s AI-driven learning platform is increasing enrollments and course completions, thereby accelerating strategic skill acquisition.
has demonstrated a statistical link between a worker's amount of learning and their overall level of engagement. impact studies show a direct correlation between learning and performance, and additional analyses have shown that people with a higher likelihood and willingness to learn have better overall performance. What's more, the Net Promoter Score for IBM’s learning offerings is consistently high. As the half-life of skills shrinks, AI-based learning ensures IBM’s workforce skills remain relevant.
Develop: Real-time skills inference
Every needs to know what skills people have, and the level of their skills. One approach is to use employee self-assessments. Even with manager validation of self-ratings, however, there is a lot of over-rating and under-rating of expertise that occurs, because managers rarely have the time to audit the results carefully.                       Manual assessment processes can also quickly become outdated and are often viewed as box-ticking exercises. Now, makes it possible to infer skills by scraping the internal digital presence of employees. Data can come from sources such as resumes, sales information, and digital badges.                       Once the skill profiles are generated, they can be made available to employees and managers to validate.
AI-based skills inference can help organizations to find the ‘hidden gems’ in an organization, the people with skills you didn’t even know existed. At an aggregate level,                       it is possible to design a heatmap of the skills a has versus skills that are needed, and intervention plans can be put in place that allows businesses to quickly close skill gaps.
For the past three years has been honing skills inference technology internally. This process is now between 85-95% accurate. Employees have access to their own skill profiles through an expertise management interface.                           This approach saves thousands of hours previously spent completing skills inventories, and the information is continually refreshed, providing more accurate, real-time skills insight.
Results of the skills inference technology allow to monitor skills relative to needs, and to see how its skill profile compares with competitors. This allows to identify targeted interventions to close skill gaps.

Career coaching is a powerful way to create more meaningful work experiences for employees and can lead to greater productivity and stronger succession pipelines for businesses. Career coaching is usually high touch, time intensive, and expensive.                       This has meant that coaching has usually been reserved for people who were either underperforming, or for high potential individuals that an organization was prepared to invest a considerable amount of money in. However, bringing this level of opportunity for employee career                       development to everyone in the organization is likely to lead to benefits to both the employees whose motivation and engagement increases, and also the organization itself through improved employee job performance overall.
wanted to provide high quality career guidance to all employees, regardless of level. The solution developed is a personal advisor, Watson Career Coach (WCC), that brings the benefits of career coaching to all of                           The personal advisor is an assistant that interacts with employees who are thinking about future opportunities.                           It gets to know the employee by asking and answering questions with natural language and integrating with historical information.
second component of the solution, job opportunity match, allows employees to upload their resumes or answer questions about skills, and then suggests roles that are suitable for the employee. If workers are looking for opportunities further out, they can use a career navigator component.                           The career navigator lets workers plan their way towards desired roles and prepares them for growth towards those roles with development suggestions that will help them build the required skills.                           The assistant can also offer personalized learning recommendations which help employees continuously develop their skills.
Serve: for 24/7 employee interaction
chatbot is an application that understands natural language and interacts with users in human-like conversation.                       Chatbots are arguably the technology with the broadest application to problems, and they have been deployed in most areas of HR.
“We can take anybody and have them build a bot. The technology today is really very easy to use. An can create the content and train the bot.”
— Jon Lester, Digital Strategy Lead, IBM

Chatbots are inexpensive to design, and quick to train. Chatbot implementation can be managed even by non-technical staff because of the wide availability of easy-to-use application programming interfaces (APIs).                       For these reasons, chatbots are a natural starting point for organizations wanting to build into their function.                       If you have an process that generates a lot of questions from employees, you can deploy a chatbot based on a well-developed frequently asked questions (FAQ) list about the process.
Joanna Daly, of Talent, on chatbots in HR
Chatbots are a perfect example of where can improve the employee experience, because they provide real-time answers at any time, day or night.                       Chatbots also constantly learn from feedback, and improve the answers given.
It is always a good idea to involve people with communications experience in the design of the chatbot.                       Communications experts can help work on word choices and tone of the bot to increase personalization.
Nirvana with chatbots will be bots that are embedded in the workflow of employees and help with work rather than just answer questions about how to do the work.                       For example, if a manager needs to transfer an employee to a new department, the interaction with the bot would result in actually executing the transfer.                       This is referred to as ‘conversational HR,’ which extends the functionality of the bot.
has chatbots that are used by employees all year round in areas across For example, has deployed chatbots to support employees with their benefits enrollment decisions, and to support managers with their compensation planning;                           both are areas with designated time periods characterized by high usage rates, requiring fast responses to user questions.
Chatbots that are busier at certain times of the year, such as the performance management, benefits enrollment, and compensation planning chatbots, are considered 'seasonal bots.' also has bots that are accessed 24 hours a day,                           seven days a week, year-round. An example is IBM’s popular new-hire chatbot. It is one of the busiest chatbots at IBM, answering 700 questions a day. New hire chatbots are particularly helpful because they resolve the challenge of not knowing who to ask for help.
IBM’s goal with chatbots is to get answers to employees quickly and accurately, while reducing the amount of effort it takes to support programs.                           The time saved can then be spent on experts answering more complex questions and problems about issues.

Time to results
The timeline for observing results from your efforts with will vary, depending on the projects you choose and outcomes affected. If you are using to improve hiring, you might see some benefits quickly, such as a faster time to hire. However, other anticipated benefits, such as higher performance, will take longer to demonstrate. An attrition solution will also take time to show value, since you need to wait to see whether or not workers leave or don’t leave in the way you expect.
The timeline to results depends on two factors, the decision to buy or build and the nature of the project being undertaken.
Whether you buy or build
If you buy off-the-shelf solutions, you can expect to see results in term of within the first three to six months. The more complex solutions will often begin with a minimum viable product (MVP), the first and smallest deliverable that can be built that is meaningful to the user and tests the assumptions made by the business. These can then be quickly enhanced to bring even more value to the business. With the APIs that are available today, even complex projects can show a return in less than one year. Importantly, achieving results in fast timeframes requires a mindset change. Design thinking and agile working approaches will help to rapidly build prototypes and iterate towards improved versions in short periods of time.
Nature of project
If you are using to improve hiring, you might see some benefits quickly, such as a faster time to hire. However, other anticipated benefits, such as higher performance, will take longer to occur. retention solution will also take time to show value, since you need to wait to see whether or not workers leave or don’t leave in the way you expect.
There are other areas where you can see results within as little as six months. Chatbots, for example, can be built and deployed very quickly. IBM’s performance management chatbot was built and deployed in under four weeks.
getting started
“Think about the process or solution in your area of responsibility that provides the most challenge. What is it that you need the most help with, and what from an perspective will allow you to do that better? Then look at what you can afford for what you’re trying to achieve.”
— Robert Gibby, Chief Talent Scientist, Talent Acquisition, IBM

— Robert Gibby, Chief Talent Scientist, Talent Acquisition, IBM
Step 1: Start with a case
Companies need to start with understanding the problem they’re trying to solve with The problem should be one that can be resolved with improved insight, information, and data. Ask who the people are in the line, not in HR, that need this problem solved and will commit to it in their profit and loss reporting. For example, hiring might be a big issue for your management team because they know they are growing and need to continue to grow. If the can't afford to increase the staffing to meet this demand, you have an obvious problem that everyone can rally around with an application.
Creating a case will help you think about the structures you need in place, and ensure you are focused on the right problem. Once you have this focus, you can ask what skills and investments you need to solve the problem, and you can build a case. Keep in mind that while many organizations are used to thinking about solutions in functional capabilities, professionals and leaders will need to flip their thinking. Instead they should think about the decisions that managers, employees, and candidates make in their work routines and how they could make better decisions if they had better insights.
This approach may require input from across multiple sub-functions. The case should specify the minimum viable product (MVP) and how you will work with your sponsors to define the From this point, the objective is to test out the viability quickly, even if that's on a small scale. pilot might involve a unit, a country, a practice, or a combination of all three. At IBM, prototypes are typically built very rapidly with cross-functional teams of developers, designers, and content experts. Firms should build with the data they have and improve rather than wait for perfect data. Then share with ‘friends and family’ to get feedback, and quickly iterate. It's also important to realize there is no need to wait for technology transformation projects to finish before initiating projects in Doing so unnecessarily delays the benefits and savings that are available to those who start early.
Step 2: Decide whether to buy or build
One question that organizations need to think through is whether they will build their own applications, or whether they will buy off-the-shelf applications for Unless your organization has deep experience in AI, it is often better to leverage the efforts of companies that have already developed solutions. If you decide to build your own solution, a good way to start is to solicit ideas from the workforce. took this approach in a Cognitive Build competition. Employees were asked to generate ideas for applications, and the best were selected (via employee crowd-sourcing) and funded. Watson Career Coach is an example of an application that resulted from this process. An important contributing factor to the success of this process was bringing the users of the apps into the design process.
Importantly, regardless of whether you buy or build, deploying your capability in the cloud is the best way forward. Moving to the cloud forces you to think about the data you have and the data you need, and how to close the gap between these two perspectives.                       Cloud systems are also important to successful in because the most powerful cloud-based applications share data from systems that were traditionally distinct.
Step 3: Identify the skills you have and need
The skills required for implementing in can be categorized into skills required for development, and skills required for implementation.                       If you are working with a vendor rather than developing your own application, then only the implementation skills will be necessary.
“You always need the subject matter experts, people who understand what the offering is, what you need to accomplish – they need to be good at what they do. But now you also need the designers, people focused on the experience, as well as the answer from the standpoint.”
— Drew Valentine, Vice President People & Culture and Systems, IBM

— Drew Valentine, Vice President People & Culture and Systems, IBM
Development: Consider first the development skills. To develop for in your own organization you will usually want a multidisciplinary team to come together. The key skills to have in that team include: someone with an understanding of the market and the problem; development and engineering skills; a technical architect who understands AI, data, and which APIs to use; domain expertise; and finally, a design lead who understands how to present it from a user experience perspective. These are the core roles for designing and developing applications in HR, and they are the skills that puts on any team developing an application.
“The market for skills is competitive, so companies need to open the pipeline when looking for talent. You don't need a degree for these types of roles.                                 Many of our employees are learning these skills via bootcamps or other industry courses.””
— Kelli Jordan, Talent Leader, New Collar Initiatives, IBM

— Kelli Jordan, Talent Leader, New Collar Initiatives, IBM
Implementation: When it comes to implementation and ensuring adoption, a different set of skills is required. This tends to be a less technical skillset, and expertise is not required but an analytical approach is needed. Also needed are good hypothesis forming skills, and the experience to ask questions such as where the data came from, who trained the application, what are their motives, and whether it is appropriate to use the data in the way intended. In other words, the implementers, and ideally the end users, need to be educated consumers of the technology. If you are using to deliver outcomes to employees, you need to ask those questions to know whether the system has been properly trained. Those responsible for ensuring adoption need to know more than just how to turn the application on.
Also recommended is technical curiosity, the desire to understand how the technology works and how to use it effectively.                       practitioners with this curiosity can provide ideas for the next generation of applications.
Irrespective of whether you buy or build, practitioners using need to be much more knowledgeable about the business. Where they have been functionally siloed in the past, they now need to look at the employees in their entirety, because applications often work across functional areas (e.g.,                       benefits can be traded for compensation, assignments overseas can now integrate with career development).
Step 4: Implement the MVP
sometimes refers to a ‘self-funding’ model. Self-funding refers to the idea that the cases have projected revenue increases or projected cost savings that cover the costs associated with the project. Once these objectives are met, the project has then paid for itself.                       In other words, the makes an investment today for savings next year or the following year, so the first steps take some fortitude and boldness. You wouldn’t proceed if the case wasn’t strong. This approach requires someone to invest the first dollars at the outset, but this is done with the clear expectation of a return outlined in the case.                       This approach also needs an leader with confidence that the results will get delivered, and that person will need strong influencing skills to make the case to the business. As time passes, and if the savings or revenue increases are sustained, there is usually more funding available. typically reinvests this funding in further development of applications.
The faster you deploy your MVP, the sooner you can deliver the next improved iteration. Ideally all projects, irrespective of complexity, will be like this and show benefits within 6 to 12 months. These timelines assume you have resources, dedicated effort, and data available.                       If you struggle to have any of these elements, your timelines could be pushed out further. For example, while chatbots are easy to put in place, they are ineffective without the content behind the interface on which to base answers to questions from employees.
Step 5: Roll out enterprise-wide
If the roll out is successful, scaling to the enterprise is the next step. To check whether the showed enough success to warrant further expansion, use the methodology we discussed in the previous section.                       Every time wants to initiate or take a project to the next stage of development, say from proof of concept to scaling, a case is required. The case has to have the right level of sponsorship from someone responsible for delivering the project. cases need to be tied to revenue increases or cost savings, not soft outcomes.
Scaling the solution to an entire organization can be challenging. The key is to move towards new and faster ways of working such as design thinking and agile working. These methods ensure solutions are co-created by and unit leaders and employees, which enhances the likelihood of widespread adoption.                       Design thinking is a framework for solving problems based on three principles: user-centered outcomes, empowered diverse teams, and reinvention. Agile is a work methodology that involves self-directed teams who work iteratively throughout the process of project delivery to unleash innovation, maintain accountability, and increase speed.
It should be noted that, while these steps could progress in a linear fashion, some iteration is likely. For example, you might initially opt to build your own technology, but after assessing the skills required you might determine that buying a product from a trusted partner is a better option.
The initial cases and associated funding for implementing in at started with practitioners in the lines of business, rather than corporate This is because in the lines of the partners have line of sight to the challenges.
An example of securing funding for involves deciding on which ideas to fund. Every year in August/September, IBM’s and her direct reports work to identify the ideas with the most promise. This will lead to sunsetting certain solutions, enhancing other solutions, and building new solutions. The proposals are reviewed and signed off by the The CHRO’s team then works with the lines of to secure the funding based on the projections in the case. This can involve going to the lines of business, or it can involve going to finance. Each year, people pitch their ideas. They talk about the products and services they will build, the costs they will incur, the seed money they will need, and what they will deliver in the next year.
It is important to be clear on the difference between hard cost savings (e.g., improved labor productivity), soft savings (e.g., reduced expected attrition), and revenue increases.                           IBM’s goal has been to keep its overall budget flat and reinvest savings to grow its capabilities and the benefits they bring.
Tips for successful adoption in HR
“It is important not to use to instruct the actions of a manager. You should share the results of the analysis and let them still make the decision.                                 Their knowledge about the employee, their empathy, their knowledge of how a team operates is critical to making optimal decisions.”

has learned many lessons in its deployment of AI, and interviewees recounted many that could be helpful to practitioners, so we share some of the major learnings here.
Don’t wait until you have the perfect solution
It is better to release a minimum viable product and position it as such with your employees. When released the performance management chatbot, people knew it was ready but not perfect, and were encouraged to ask questions that would challenge the bot.                           This allowed to deploy the solution quickly, while at the same time enabling the chatbot to improve.
Empower people with AI
Designers of systems have a stewardship responsibility to ensure that empowers workers. Designers should keep in mind that people feel most empowered when their decision autonomy is augmented rather than replaced.                           has been viewed most favorably when managers have the option to override the recommendations when not seen as optimal. encourages managers to be comfortable overriding the recommendations as appropriate.
Ensure transparency
For managers to feel comfortable working with an recommendation, it is important that there is clarity and transparency about why recommendations are made.                           This should include making clear to managers and employees what the recommendation aimed to achieve, what data were used to make the recommendation, which variables influenced the recommendation most, as well as identifying all the variables on which the recommendations were based, and the expected accuracy of the recommendation.
Consider language and culture
requires context, reflected in data from different regions where will be deployed, to learn and make appropriate recommendations.                           An solution designed in one region of a multinational organization’s operations may need to be entirely retrained before deployment in another region – even if the same language is spoken in both areas.                           This relates to both the development and training of the model, as well as the experiences of the end users of the solution.
Design each app with other apps in mind
As you develop your solutions, it is a good idea to have a holistic view of the end goal in mind. This will avoid, for example, having a proliferation of unconnected chatbots all addressing related questions but not drawing on common infrastructure and data.                           It is increasingly important to do this because apps often do not sit in the traditional siloed subdomains.                           For instance, the compensation example discussed earlier requires information from compensation and learning, among other functions.
societal considerations
systems need to be developed in an ethically sound manner if the promise of is to be fulfilled while mitigating the potential risks. For this reason, complements its work on the technical development of with policy streams on and ethics covering five areas; accountability, value alignment, explainability, fairness, and user data rights7. In the context, ensuring applications are developed in an ethical manner ensures our applications are consistent with broader societal values and goals. We discuss some of these societal implications in this section.
The net effect of on jobs
Experts make all sorts of predictions about the net effect of on overall job numbers. It is important to be transparent about the fact that nobody knows for certain the end effect of on the number of jobs. It is impossible to make a prediction that is likely to be accurate. What everyone can be confident of, however, is that some roles will disappear, some roles will be created, and almost all roles are going to change as a result of It is not the first time that technology has displaced jobs. Looking back, it would be unimaginable to argue, for example, that agrarian technology should not have been developed in order to protect the roles of farm workers. The same is true today with the use of in In the short-term we don’t see a lot of jobs going away that have not already disappeared due to technology prior to (e.g., the internet). The jobs at most risk are very transactional jobs, such as people who ask pre-screening questions in recruitment.
Are chatbots taking jobs?
Consider the applications that people might think are most likely to replace jobs, chatbots. What is actually seeing is that the chatbots are addressing basic questions, things that are routine, allowing professionals to address more complex questions. In fact, jobs have been created in the process of deploying chatbots. These jobs relate to designing and training the bot. For most jobs, responsibilities are changing rather than disappearing. It is components of jobs that are going away. The parts that are going away are the rote, routine parts that can be automated. The parts of jobs that are gaining in importance are analytical thinking, strategizing, and driving change. The key questions are how the way work gets done is going to change, which roles will experience a lot of change, which will experience little change, and how quickly all of that is going to happen - short or medium term? This knowledge can help provide the information that workers will need to re-skill, in order to establish career paths in the more compelling roles that are emerging in HR.

creates higher value jobs
There are a number of higher value jobs that are being created in due to The new Talent Scientist role integrates sourcing, industrial-organizational psychology, and to analyze data, identify top talent, leverage enhanced decision support, and predict success – all in a way that appeals to candidates.                       In other words, they marry the science of data to the art of sourcing, and continually drive a successful hiring outcome with higher predictability. Another new role at known as Talent Influencers makes up the next generation of digitally and socially connected recruiters who have a personal brand tied to domain and industry.                       They use cutting-edge platforms popular with candidates to attract top talent.
IBM’s departments are now staffed with data scientists, and the company now has a whole team focused on sentiment analysis and listening to internal social media for chatter to gauge sentiment. This would have been unheard of before was implemented in                       Designers and user experience experts are becoming more prevalent in Learning scientists with skills work alongside neuroscientists to reimagine IBM’s learning content and experience. In short, can now offer more compelling careers as the prevalence of the human-machine partnership continues to increase.
AI, diversity, and bias
has great potential to help with bias if we are careful about design. Companies developing these systems and the organizations deploying them have a responsibility to be conscious of potential bias, and to work actively to address its existence. There is nothing about that magically reduces biases. technology can be used to reduce bias or, if we aren’t careful, reinforce it. At IBM, there are many areas where shows promise at reducing bias. For example, candidate attraction and recruitment solutions, described earlier, create a mindset shift in candidates about what’s possible by recommending jobs they did not know they were qualified for. This is because these applications focus on skills in the recommendation and hiring system. If you have the skills required for a role, these applications tell you about the role, irrespective of your gender or ethnicity. Building apps in this way has required close working between content domain experts and machine learning teams – both skill sets are required for effective Diversity of thought in the creation of apps is essential to building apps that are as free of bias as possible.

— Tanya Moore, Director, Career & Skills, IBM

— Tanya Moore, Director, Career & Skills, IBM
Use of historical information
critical element in IBM’s approach to increasing diversity to date has been to be very careful with how it uses historical information concerning characteristics of top employees. These top performers have a long list of characteristics, but only some of these will be related to how well they perform. If you focus on high performer characteristics unrelated to performance, not only will you be making poorer decisions, but the will have the perverse effect of harming diversity. This is because the bias is learned, reapplied, amplified, and made systemic. For example, if your top performers are all male, and you select more males because of this, you are likely to have a discriminatory hiring system. You are focusing on an attribute of your high performers – gender – but it is not an attribute that relates to performance. There is no theoretical reason that gender should be a predictor of job performance, and this view is supported by analyses at IBM.
The people writing apps at work hard to ensure that the applications are feature blind to aspects that are not related to future job performance.                       can also help remove bias through analysis of decisions of managers. can show where there is a deviation from expectations and show statistically what the causes of the disparities were.
Build in fairness and ensure transparency
It is unlikely that will resolve all issues related to bias. technology simply augments a person's capabilities, and the capabilities can be used for good or bad. This needs to be reflected in the way we think about applications, from the very foundation of their design.                       solutions need to and can be fair and unbiased by design. Building fairness into your systems, and being completely transparent in your use of (whose data, what the information is used for, etc.) will ensure you stay on the right side of the good versus bad technology divide.

Reducing risk and ensuring compliance
Banking and insurance organizations must comply with ever-changing regulations and document their operations for compliance audits. Non-compliance results not only in fines but also in erosion of customer trust. Additionally, it’s difficult to identify where compliance updates must be performed within applications. And there’s a risk of misinterpreting new regulations in manual operations.
Increased automation of decisions limits interpretation risk, and with Operational Decision Manager you can automate more decisions and log them for precise documentation and audit trails.
