Who We Are
Leadership
Awards
Billions, maybe trillions of times a day…
We often do what many thought was impossible.
That’s how often people around the world touch something made better by Qualcomm. It could be the smartphone in your pocket, the tablet on your coffee table, that wireless modem in your briefcase… it could even be that navigation system in your car or that action camera strapped to your chest.
Who is Qualcomm, and what do we do? We are engineers, scientists and business strategists. We are from many different countries and speak many different languages. We come from diverse cultures and have unique perspectives. Together, we focus on a single goal—invent mobile technology breakthroughs.
Invention at Invention is at the heart of human progress, at the heart of the mobile industry, and both are at the heart of our business.

See leadership
Pioneers, risk takers.
While many of our inventions and breakthroughs reside “under the hood” of consumer electronics, they have transformed the world in a big way. They have helped propel mobile to the forefront of the technology world and to the top of consumers’ wish lists. They have created new opportunities for mobile ecosystem players—the wireless device makers, the operators, the developers and the content creators of the world. And more recently, our inventions and breakthroughs have inspired fresh, new ideas from those companies—large and small—new to the wireless space.
We’ve been called dreamers, inventors, rebels, risk takers, pioneers and geeks. We embrace those labels because in many ways, they’re true. We dream big. We invent bigger. And most importantly, we often do what many thought was impossible.
