The next generation in lighting has arrived, shining brighter and farther than ever before. In the last decade, enabled a new generation of lighting that changed everything. Now, LaserLight outshines the limits of to deliver safe, high luminance white light from an incredibly small point source. LaserLight doesn’t just offer superior technology, it’s enabling entirely new opportunities.
We are commercializing revolutionary semi-polar GaLaserLight for the next generation of display, automotive, and specialty applications.  LaserLight sources are used directly in single color and R-G-applications, or integrated into pumped phosphor architectures.
As an independent spin-off from Inc, was founded in 2013 by several leading global pioneers in solid state lighting, including Dr. Shuji Nakamura, a 2014 Nobel Laureate in Physics for his groundbreaking work with LEDs, Dr. Steve Denbaars, Dr. James Raring, and Dr. Paul Rudy. Our technology incorporates a robust intellectual property portfolio of over 500 patents
