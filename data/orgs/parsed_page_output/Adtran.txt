2017 REVIEW
2017 was a stellar year and also introduced an annual event called for Good Community Charity Fair. Over 70 local non-profits set up booths around the lake on ADTRAN's beautiful campus. Employees from and other surrounding companies walked our campus to learn more about the visiting non-profits. Due to the success of the project, a 2nd annual event will take place in the fall of 2018. Our goal of this event was to match volunteers with vetted non-profits.
