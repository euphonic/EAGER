Tell us about your invention
The first, essential step in technology commercialisation is for you to tell us about the work you’re doing.
It is never too early for you to talk to us about an idea you’re working on. You may have had a flash of inspiration, or you may have a fully-working prototype. There is no wrong time to let us know about your work.
Most academic research that has commercial potential will require intellectual property protection. It is therefore important that you let us know about it before you publish or share information about the work publicly. This will allow us to secure a strong position.
You can talk to us in absolute confidence. We will not discuss your ideas with other parties without your express consent.
The form below is a simple way to get in contact with our team to start a conversation about your research, inventions, or a discovery you have made that you think has commercial potential. Please provide some background information on your research and let us know what department you are a member of. This will enable us to quickly route your enquiry to an experienced member of our team. If you wish, you can also use our people section to find and contact an executive directly.
We will respond to your enquiry within seven working days.
Please note: we work exclusively with staff at College London and at the Trusts we partner with. If you are not a member of staff at these organisations, we may reply to you but it is unlikely we will be able to work with you.
Tell us about your idea or invention
Use this form to let us know about an idea or invention you've developed that you think may have commercial potential. This is the start of a formal invention disclosure procedure that members of our technology transfer team will discuss with you in more detail after they have made contact with you.

is part of a network comprising inventors, investors, start-up and spin-outs. We support new technologies with the potential for significant impact in the environment, society, and individual lives. It is important that we supplement this by recognising and giving back to the communities around us.
We aim to build an environment that enables our workers to achieve to the best of their ability. We promote a diverse and inclusive work place, where each person is recognised by their achievement and hard work. In creating and maintaining a fair culture, free of prejudice, we hope to attract the best talent.
It is also important that talent is nurtured and developed internally. Staff are encouraged to seek further training, and we promote all vacancies internally.
We consider to be an equal opportunities employer, and do not differentiate based on gender, ethnicity, religion, or physical ability. supports universal human rights for its employees and ensures that, where possible, its transactions uphold these principles.
We hold numerous events to promote social wellbeing within Innovations, including quiz nights and annual team building exercises, such as white water rafting and group cooking competitions.
Internship programme
Since summer 2011, over 70 interns have taken part in our paid internship programme, assisting in roles ranging from market analysis, to patent management and contract administration.
Most interns have a scientific background, having completed PhDs or Post-doctoral degrees before joining Innovations. Taking part in an internship at gives interns valuable experience of the commercial aspects of science and research and facilitates the transition from the lab to a business. Many interns take up positions within the technology transfer or patents and licensing fields, with some even going on to start their own ventures.
Health and Wellbeing
We know that a business depends on its staff being healthy. All members of staff are provided with access to discounted gym membership and we run occasional events such as company table-tennis, badminton and 5-a-side football sessions. has a strong cycling culture, which is facilitated by access to a cycle-to-work scheme.
Community
Our community volunteering scheme allows our employees a number of days per year to use flexibly for social or community based activity. Staff members are encouraged to donate such volunteering time to charitable activities, and we also provide opportunities to take part in corporate charitable events. These have included repainting a state primary school in West London and repairing a community garden.
We have raised money for several charities, including Macmillan, Save the Children, the Autism Society, and Genetic Disorders UK, through internal events such as office bake-offs, Christmas jumper days, and casual clothing days. Furthermore, individual members of staff have participated in charity runs and cycles, raising money for organisations such as Le Cure de France, Scope, and the British Heart Foundation.
Alumni
We are in the process of setting up an Alumni network for and Touchstone plc. We consider our former associates to be part of our extended family. Our Alumni network will allow us to connect with former employees, keep in touch and, in the future, meet up with us for some social events also.
Sponsoring innovation
As a commercial partner to College London, we try to foster creativity and entrepreneurship within the community. has sponsored competitions and events such as the Den, a business plan competition taking place within the Institute of Chemical Biology and styled after Dragon’s Den.
We also developed the Venture Catalyst Challenge, a six-week entrepreneurial programme where students and alumni develop their business ideas with guidance from a variety of mentors and present to a panel of investors for a chance to win a cash prize. January 2016 saw the inaugural run of our Art of Research scientific image competition, which aimed to showcase the breadth of research undertaken at through images created by scientists. To the right is Trisection, a submission by Li Shen showing the "trisection" of three different bubbles undergoing thin-film drainage.
Environment
is committed to being an environmentally friendly institution. We monitor and review our emissions and have put in place a cycle-to-work scheme, which encourages staff to adopt climate-friendly commutes. Staff members regularly also work from home. Doing so has not only reduced the amount of emissions from transport (both to/from the office and with out-of-site meetings), but has also increased the use of electronic documents and a reduction in paper used for printing. Furthermore, our waste disposal contractor is able to recycle plastics, glass, paper, and organic waste, with electrical waste processed by a dedicated contractor.
In the past year, we have been able to reduce our on-site energy consumption by 16%.
Technology for the future
As a part of Innovations’ role as the Technology Transfer Office for College London, we are in a unique position to support environmentally-friendly new technologies on their route to market. In the past few years, we have (or are in the process of) commercialising technologies such as:
method to incorporate atmospheric CO2 in the production of polymers
Novel designs for motor components to increase engine efficiencies
Multiple pipeline health analytic systems, which help prevent leaks and improve resource use efficiency
Novel forms of generating energy
system to mass produce molecules from rare plants while protecting wild populations
