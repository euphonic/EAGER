About
What we do
We work with researchers at College London to help develop their novel research into new businesses, products or services.
We support the process of taking an idea from the lab into the market. Importantly, we take the commercial risk, paying for protection up-front – inventors don’t pay a penny to work with us.
We assess inventions, considering commercial potential, the state of the market and development requirements
We protect intellectual property through patents and other appropriate forms of intellectual property protection
We provide advice on establishing proof of concept, using our commercial experience to inform inventors about what businesses want to see
We may provide development funding or support inventors in their applications for funding from other sources
We advise on and commercial strategy
We manage the licensing process (including negotiations and post-deal administration)
Our Venture Support Unit establishes new businesses, finds mentors and management and provides access to preferred suppliers
Above all we are flexible in our support – capable of executing novel deals and providing unique support where required.

Tell us about your invention
The first, essential step in technology commercialisation is for you to tell us about the work you’re doing.
It is never too early for you to talk to us about an idea you’re working on. You may have had a flash of inspiration, or you may have a fully-working prototype. There is no wrong time to let us know about your work.
Most academic research that has commercial potential will require intellectual property protection. It is therefore important that you let us know about it before you publish or share information about the work publicly. This will allow us to secure a strong position.
You can talk to us in absolute confidence. We will not discuss your ideas with other parties without your express consent.
The form below is a simple way to get in contact with our team to start a conversation about your research, inventions, or a discovery you have made that you think has commercial potential. Please provide some background information on your research and let us know what department you are a member of. This will enable us to quickly route your enquiry to an experienced member of our team. If you wish, you can also use our people section to find and contact an executive directly.
We will respond to your enquiry within seven working days.
Please note: we work exclusively with staff at College London and at the Trusts we partner with. If you are not a member of staff at these organisations, we may reply to you but it is unlikely we will be able to work with you.
Tell us about your idea or invention
Use this form to let us know about an idea or invention you've developed that you think may have commercial potential. This is the start of a formal invention disclosure procedure that members of our technology transfer team will discuss with you in more detail after they have made contact with you.
