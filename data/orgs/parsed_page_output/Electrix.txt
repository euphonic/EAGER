Please join Electrix, in welcoming Dwight Kitchen as our new team leader, taking on the position of President and General Manager effective immediately. He will have responsibility for all business development and operations, reporting to Chief Executive Officer, Cory Meyer.
Dwight will be leading the company to build on Electrix's strong reputation for high quality, innovative lighting and architectural solutions. With Electrix' recent launches of the MagneConnect ™ and ellumi™ product lines, we're excited to leverage Dwight's history of strategic, operational and commercial accomplishments to achieve major growth.
Dwight has a proven 30-year track record with Osram Sylvania, serving most recently as the Vice President and General Manager for Traxon e:cue North America. Prior, Dwight was the Regional Luminaires for Osram Sylvania, starting up a luminaire business that grew substantially in three years by introducing "open innovation" with partners to accelerate development, extending the business to South America, and developing partnerships with peer market leaders. Along the way the new portfolio received numerous accolades including: Design Journal's Gold & Platinum Awards for Design Excellence; Lighting for Tomorrow Design Award; and Next Generation Luminaires Design Competition Award.
Dwight was instrumental in several transformations at Osram Sylvania through a distinguished career with key roles in sales, marketing, and engineering, first managing the technology shift from traditional lighting product to solid state components and then into an integrated solid state solutions provider.
Mark Lahner, will serve as the Executive Vice President for Business Development focusing on strategic relationships, industry alignment and collaboration opportunities. With his years of experience and relationships in the industry, we are confident Mark will be a vehicle to further accelerate our growth.
"Dwight comes to us with a wealth of lighting experience running various business areas of Osram. We look forward to continuing towards our goal of being a world class, customer concentric partner to our clientele in the Architectural and Industrial channels. We are also excited about the opportunities for the future with Mark focused on developing products and customers in the Architectural lighting channel," said Cory Meyer, CEO.

For MetLife, consolidating their 1,500 New York employees to one location was a chance to redefine the insurance company’s workplace and reinvigorate the staff. Part of this process included redesigning the interior of the MetLife building which you can see in our gallery.
For Electrix, this was an
opportunity for us to push the capability of the K8 Knife Edge Cove Framing System.
We customized our standard 8” knife edge system with radius corners. Our K8-L
symmetric luminaires were installed. 
Check out the MetLife gallery

 Interior Design Awards
Interior Design Awards
Tuesday, Dec 6, 2016
Congratulations to 
Architects
 and 
Architectural Lighting 
for winning Interior Design's BoAward in the Fitness Category for the Robers Pavillion! Claremont McKenna College’s new 144,000 square-foot Roberts Pavilion
dramatically redefines what a college athletic venue can be. An iconic
social hub that brings students and faculty together, it demarks a new
gateway for the campus while reacting to the push and pull of
surrounding buildings, playing fields, and aquatic center.

LumiLedge LLSR-FR7
 and compatible luminaires are featured throughout including in curved cove applications! Our cove framing systems significantly reduce field labor and also deliver a more uniform, seamless finished cove profile than field built coves. 
Interior Design's Best of Year is the design industry’s premiere design
awards, honoring the most significant work of the year from around the
globe. Now celebrating its 11th year, Interior Design's Best of Year has become the ultimate measure of
excellence, showcasing what's happening today in every category of
design while simultaneously setting the design bar even higher for the
future.
