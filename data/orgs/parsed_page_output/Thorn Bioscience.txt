Louisville, 40204Laura Ms. Thorn’s professional experience includes many different areas in the equine industry. For the last ten years, she has been involved in the management and development of a substantial equine breeding program, out of which arose Ms. Thorn’s experience covers a broad range of business undertakings, including the implementation of state-of-the-art embryo transfer based production of Warmblood performance horses. She has bred and raised horses which have campaigned successfully at international horse shows.
As part of Hamilton-Research partners, she participated in the development of new equine technologies, including the Hamilton-Semen Analyzer and the Equitainer for the shipping of cooled semen and embryos. In addition, she continues to support equine reproductive research at Cornell University and the University of Pennsylvania and her family’s interests in research at Tufts University and Colorado State University.
