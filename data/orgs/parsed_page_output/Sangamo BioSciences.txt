Sangamo’s Mission
We are committed to translating ground-breaking science into genomic therapies that transform patients’ lives.
Pioneering Genetic Cures
Accelerating toward the future of new genomic therapies – Since the first mapping of the human genome was completed 18 years ago, the progress of sequencing technology has accelerated exponentially. Every day we are learning more about the function and interplay of our genes, how they make us who we are, and how they contribute to human health and disease. The therapeutic potential of the genome is being unlocked.
Over that same time, has forged the way toward the future of genomic therapies. Our scientists were the first to edit human cells and the first to conduct clinical trials with gene edited cells. Recently, we initiated the first ever in vivo genome editing clinical trials. We have continued to perfect our zinc finger nuclease technology, which today sets the standards for genomic therapies along the three critical dimensions of specificity, precision, and efficiency.
Along the way, we have become experts across a range of genomic therapies, including genome editing, gene regulation, gene therapy and cell therapy. With this technological range and our development and manufacturing experience, is uniquely prepared to deliver the new genomic therapies that will change the practice of medicine.

Privacy PolicyOur strategy is to retain and develop product candidates ourselves in certain therapeutic areas that meet key criteria including having breakthrough potential for unmet needs; where development and commercialization are financially and operationally feasible; and where we see synergies across our product candidates and therapeutic approaches.
We are focusing our proprietary pipeline on research and development of product candidates for inherited metabolic diseases, central nervous system diseases, and immunology.
Collaboration is critical to maximizing the value of our platform technology and has brought important funding and expertise to our research. We will continue to collaborate, especially in therapeutic areas that are highly competitive or that require special disease area expertise or resources.

Hemophilia is a rare bleeding disorder, caused by a deficiency of clotting Factor protein, in which blood does not clot or stop bleeding when blood vessels are injured. SB-525 is a gene therapy that uses an vector to deliver a new therapeutic copy of the Factor 8 gene to the patient’s liver cells, designed to enable the liver to produce and secrete functionally active Factor protein into the bloodstream.

Bioverativ
Beta thalassemia is a rare blood disorder caused by a mutation in the beta-globin gene that results in greatly impaired production of healthy red blood cells. ST-400 is a gene-edited cell therapy that uses our genome editing technology to modify a patient’s own (autologous) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to produce functional red blood cells using fetal hemoglobin.

Sickle cell disease is a blood disease caused by a mutation in the beta-globin gene that causes the red blood cells to form an abnormal sickle or crescent shape. The cells are fragile and deliver less oxygen to the body’s tissues resulting in pain and irreversible organ damage. BIVV-003 is a gene-edited cell therapy that uses our genome editing technology to modify a patient’s own (autologous) hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to produce normal-shaped, functional red blood cells using fetal hemoglobin.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) are part of a spectrum of neurodegenerative disorders linked to mutations in the C9ORF72 gene that involve hundreds of additional repetitions of a six base pair sequence of This ultimately leads to the deterioration of motor neurons, in the case of ALS, or neurons in the frontal and temporal lobes, in the case of In collaboration with Pfizer, we are developing a gene therapy, using our ZFP-gene regulation technology, designed to specifically downregulate the mutant C9ORF72 allele to treat and linked to mutations of the C9ORF72 gene.

Huntington’s disease is an inherited, progressive neurologic disease caused by a mutation in the gene characterized by greater than 39 additional repetitions of a three base pair sequence of Most patients inherit one normal and one mutant copy of the gene, which ultimately leads to deterioration of muscle control, cognition and memory, onset in adulthood. In collaboration with Shire, we are developing a gene therapy using our ZFP-gene regulation technology, designed to selectively repress the expression of the mutant allele while leaving expression levels of the normal gene unchanged.
