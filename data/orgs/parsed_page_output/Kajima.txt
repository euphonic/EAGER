Hawaiian Dredging is also among the state’s most diversified general contractors comprising five major divisions:  1) Building, 2) Commercial, 3) Heavy Civil, 4) Power & Industrial, and 5) Waterfront & Foundation. With our diverse and collective experience, resources and expertise, Hawaiian Dredging has continued to lead the industry in a comprehensive array of construction services on projects ranging from hospitality, commercial, residential, institutional and healthcare, as well as major infrastructure and utilities work.
