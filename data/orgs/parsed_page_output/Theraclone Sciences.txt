Headquartered in Seattle, is a discovery-stage biotech developing novel therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases. Our proprietary discovery platform allows us to comprehensively screen and identify the rare antibodies that select individuals produce to successfully ward off disease.
Central to our discovery approach, we identify antibodies produced naturally by human memory cells in response to disease-causing agents or conditions. This allows us to identify monoclonal antibodies that are likely to be highly effective in combating disease in a broad patient population. The antibodies identified through our discovery process can be further studied as tools for vaccine development, and can yield novel targets.
Our primary research focus is to discover novel targets and antibodies, and develop therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, by using our proprietary B-cell technology platform to mine the immune system of cancer patients who have responded to cancer immunotherapies.
Other advanced development programs are focused on infectious disease including novel antibodies to fight pandemic and seasonal influenza. Our flu program is in partnership with Zenyaku Kogyo Co., Ltd. Also, in partnership with the International Vaccine Initiative, we have identified the most potent and broadly neutralizing anti-antibodies; Gilead has licensed these antibodies for clinical development and commercialization.
is a venture-funded company founded in 2005. Our investors include Venture Partners, Canaan Partners, Healthcare Ventures, Amgen Ventures, MPM, and We are actively seeking development partners in the U.S., Europe, and Japan to help us create and commercialize antibody therapeutic products.
