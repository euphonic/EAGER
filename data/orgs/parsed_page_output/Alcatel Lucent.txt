Live Care 360° lets residents and carers access the information available to nurses at Thomas Holt facilities and vice versa, improving service quality for in-home care. The platform also enhances productivity by digitizing performance management and reducing administrative tasks for carers. This permits staff to focus on delivering quality care and supports them in making better clinical decisions.

and BCDVideo address evolving video surveillance network requirements with SPB
Alcatel-Enterprise and 
BCDVideo
 develop technical and sales alliance to address evolving video surveillance market

Demand for video surveillance and connected safety in hospitality, casino, arena, cities, and healthcare environments drive increase in technology requirements
Alcatel-Enterprise and BCDVideo, a leading provider of innovative, purpose-built video storage solutions, today announced they are working together to address the growing demand of businesses to enhance public security and safety via video surveillance and networking. 
Advances in Video surveillance are helping cities, hospitals, hotels, sporting and entertainment venues focus on improving public safety, deterring crime and helping police solve crimes, and providing first responders with situational awareness during emergencies. These enterprises recognize accessing video surveillance systems, files, analytics and applications requires a stable network with reduced network downtime and increased network reliability.
The two companies are aligning to offer customers and integrators best in breed technology via a simplified infrastructure and an award-winning surveillance system. Leveraging Shortest Path Bridging (SPB) technology offered on the Alcatel-
OmniSwitch® family of products
, the joint offer creates a highly available network that exceeds speed and management requirements to support the massive data transfer and file volume of a surveillance system. ALE’s unique offering in the surveillance market delivers built-in, easy provisioning and integration of surveillance equipment for more flexibility, while reducing the cost of implementing and maintaining the network.
Technology Assured

Video surveillance networks often suffer high latency issues from legacy switching solutions. reduces the latency time to deliver data packets and enables high network availability for maximum use of all physical connections and routed services resulting in greater network stability. and BCDVideo worked closely to ensure each piece of the solution was tested for high availability leveraging technology. Businesses and integrators gain a resilient surveillance network with a simplified infrastructure, which optimizes the surveillance system performance and results. 
switches provide high system resiliency with redundant hot-swappable power supplies and virtual chassis capability. With support for SPB-M, switches offer a scalable network architecture, with fast convergence, resilient and easy to manage multicast network for video surveillance. 
Quotes
Darren Giacomini, Director of Advanced Systems Architecture at BCDVideo 
– “Improper network configurations are the root of most technical issues with surveillance systems. As technology advances, BCDVideo recognizes video content is only as good as the ability for the viewer to attain access to the files over the network. It has become imperative for various government bodies and business owners to deploy video surveillance systems to effectively monitor and record activities within and around the premises. Aligning our systems to build a best of breed network with a switch vendor like Alcatel-Enterprise, enables us to jointly deliver a highly reliable system to customers in a range of specialized environments.”
Matt Overstreet, Channel Lead at ALE, North America 
– “Surveillance solutions have changed immensely over the last decade and, in many ways, networking for these solutions has not changed with them. Many businesses are now recognizing the need to upgrade their underlying network to achieve the performance needed to utilize their surveillance solution appropriately. This new joint offering from and BCDVideo transcends what surveillance networks were capable of in the past by taking our companies’ two most reliable solutions and providing reliability and optimization that neither can deliver alone. Our OmniSwitch core and edge switches are optimized to move traffic over and provide critical connectivity between servers and network devices.”

Khipu Networks Ltd

Kreativ House is a collection of boutique design private studios, flexible workspace and art gallery in London that support forward-thinking businesses and their teams. The inclusive space was built to offer SMBs a stylish working environment where they can deliver better customer service and become more effective commercial entities.

Challenges
Kreativ House’s rich mix of businesses required a flexible network solution to suit the needs of the various tenants and guests, with up to 200 occupants during an exhibition or art event. 
Kreativ House wanted a solution that could be implemented across new sites to give customers access to consistent services and systems irrespective of location. It had to offer simple and secure access to tenants, customers and visitors.

With up to 20,000 guests entering Okada Manila during peak hours, the resort needed a resilient, reliable, and secure network infrastructure to handle the volume of data and devices connecting at any given moment.
The resort’s network infrastructure is critical to providing an outstanding service and visitor experience onsite. Guests must be able to connect their devices seamlessly to access personal or business data, while being assured of their personal and transaction security.

Financial:
Okada Manila plans to utilize the new network to further improve the guest experience and double the resort’s daily footfall.

Blickle and Scherer needed a cloud-based solution that would support collaboration while maintaining strict safety and data protection standards.
Country: Germany 
Industry: Government 
Solution: Business Telephony, Cloud Communications, Rainbow, Unified Communications 
Blickle and Scherer provides reliable private mobile radio communications to public authorities, transport companies, energy suppliers, as well as renowned industrial enterprises and service providers. It has its headquarters in Karlsruhe and five additional locations in Southern Germany.
    
Rainbow means a considerable workload reduction in everyday life. Before, communication between sites was limited to phone calls and sending documents via e-mail. Today, multisite teams work together on sales or presentations, using video calls and instant messaging in addition to the telephone.
Peter Sandner, Rainbow Coordinator, Blickle and Scherer
Challenges
Blickle & Scherer wanted to provide employees with modern Unified Communications (UC) platform functions, such as presence information, instant messaging, image sharing, document sharing, and collaborative working on sales offers and presentations. The objective was to improve communications and collaboration between the company’s six sites.
Since Blickle & Scherer work primarily with public authorities responsible for public safety and emergency services, its employees must undergo strict security checks by the Ministry of the Interior of the federal state of Baden-Württemberg. For security reasons, and to comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the use of consumer instant messaging and Voservices is prohibited. The company needed a solution that would support collaboration while maintaining these strict safety and data protection standards.
Lastly, the solution needed to be cloud-based as there was no staff available to support implementation onsite.
Products & Solutions
Products:
Rainbow Essential
Rainbow Enterprise
Connect
Solutions:

Rainbow
Unified Communications
Benefits
Technical:
Through Blickle Leitstellen&Kommunikationstechnik, Blickle & Scherer supports Germany’s Public Safety Digital Radio, a critical channel for maintaining communications between emergency services’ mission control centers, command vehicles and emergency personnel onsite. The solution helps that the emergency workers are available 24/7 and offers a notification system to inform and guide rescue forces.
The Connect converged communication platform leverages analog and digital connectivity across sites to facilitate communications and productivity. 
Cloud-based Rainbow delivers all desired collaboration functionalities, while maintaining the strictest GDPR-compliant standards of security and data protection.
Financial:
Blickle & Scherer uses the free Rainbow Essential in combination with the licensed-based Rainbow Enterprise to generate savings while keeping all employees connected.
The monthly licensing model is cost effective for and avoids expensive investments.
