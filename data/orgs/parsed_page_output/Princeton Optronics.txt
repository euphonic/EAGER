 AS1313 
The AS1313 has a load current capability of 150mwith an ultra-low quiescent current of 1µhysteretic DC-step-down converter. The AS1313 is optimized for light loads and with efficiencies of up to 95%. In order to save power the AS1313 features a shutdown mode, where it draws less than 100nIn shutdown mode the battery is not connected to the output. In light load operation, the device enters an idle mode when most of the internal operating blocks are turned off in order to save power. This mode is active approximately 100μs after a current pulse provided that the output is in regulation. The AS1313 is available in a 8-pin (2x2) and a 0.4mm pitch 6-pin WL-package.
 AS1341 
The AS1341 is a hysteretic buck converter, capable of driving 600mat 1.25to Vin output. With efficiencies up to 96%, the device operates between 4.5to 20input.
 AS1382 
The AS1382 is a high-efficiency, constant-frequency synchronous buck converter available in adjustable and fixed-voltage versions. The wide input voltage range (2.7to 5.5V), automatic power save mode and minimal external component requirements make the AS1382 perfect for any single Li-ion battery-powered application. Typical supply current with no load is 95μand decreases to 0.04μin shutdown mode. An internal synchronous switch increases efficiency and eliminates the need for an external Schottky diode. The internally fixed switching frequency (2MHz, 3MHz or 4MHz) allows the usage of small surface- mount external components. Very low output voltages can be delivered with the internal 0.6feedback reference voltage. The AS1382 is available in a 6-pin WL-package.

Behind OLED
The mobile handset market will continue to 
follow the 
trend to ever higher screen-to-body 
ratios
 and ultimately to all-screen, bezel-less smartphones. Technology 
developed by ams
 will enable a
ccurate
 ambient light, color and proximity sensing solutions to operate behind displays used in these next generation mobile handsets.
 The new TCS3701 enables front-facing ambient light and proximity sensing measurements in smartphones – maximizing edge-to-edge display screen size – with sensor operation under display.

Display Management - Paper Like
Paper-like displays
Accurate color sensors from ams enable display controllers to shift the white point of the display in response to changes in the color temperature of ambient light: the effect is to make text as readable on the display as it is when printed in a book. 
By shifting the display’s white point to a warmer color temperature, in which there is less blue light, the display controller also minimizes eye strain caused by prolonged viewing, and can reduce the risk of sleep disturbance attributable to use of the display. 
Display Management - small aperture
Small Aperture
An infrared proximity sensor in a mobile phone is used to disable the display when the phone is raised to the user’s ear for a voice call. Proximity sensors from ams operate through a very small aperture: this keeps optical cross-talk to very low levels, almost eliminating the risk of false detection events. 
The small aperture optical sensing devices from ams are based on a refined analog front end and digital circuitry, and innovative package design techniques, producing the lowest possible noise floor. 
The same ability to operate through a small aperture is provided by the ams ambient light sensing and color sensor products, which support display management functions while enabling new mobile phone designs to benefit from a sleek look with barely visible apertures.

Smart Light Management
Single-chip solutions enable Ioconnectivity and precise control of smart lights and replacement lamps.
Asset Publisher
Smart Lighting
The AS721x/AS722x are complete system-on-chip (SoC) sensor-integrated Iosmart lighting managers for color-tunable white lighting applications. They also support daylight harvesting and color/lumen maintenance lighting applications. 0-10control and network-enabled high-level command inputs are combined with industry-standard and 0-10outputs for direct control of power systems. The Smart Lighting Director adds closed-loop sensing, providing tuning directives to an existing smart light architecture. Sensor-hub expansion capabilities include native support for various ams environmental sensors for added Ioflexibility. Non-networked versions support stand-alone color/lumen maintenance and daylighting functions for new designs and retrofits.

 AS7211 
AS7211 is a networking-enabled Iosmart lighting manager with embedded digital ambient light sensor providing closed-loop and automatic daylighting management. Ioluminaire control is through a network connection, or by direct connection to 0-10dimmers, with control outputs that include direct to drivers or analog 0-10to standard dimming ballasts. simple text-based smart lighting command set and serial interface, enables easy integration to standard network clients.
 AS7221 
Simplify tunable white lighting systems with the AS7221 sensor-integrated Iosmart lighting manager. The AS7221 will lower the manufactured cost of your tunable white lighting system. Closed loop calibrated tri-stimulus color sensing for direct color point mapping and control enables lower precision components to produce a higher-quality tunable white luminaire or replacement lamp. Pre-calibrated to a typical 2 accuracy, this network enabled chip-scale solution uses a simple text-based smart lighting command set via the serial interface to deliver easy integration to standard network clients. Legacy controls are also supported with direct connection to 0-10controls,. Control outputs include direct management of digital drivers or analog 0-10for standard dimmable drivers.
 AS7225 
Simplify tunable white lighting systems with the AS7225 sensor-integrated Iosmart sensor/director. The AS7225 will lower the manufactured cost of your tunable white lighting system, while allowing maximum Ioflexibility by working in conjunction with any standard application host microprocessor. CCT-calibrated tri-stimulus color sensing for direct color point mapping translates targets to warm/cool string directives. Adaptive algorithmic support enables a companion application host microprocessor to implement closed-loop, autonomous adjustment of variable and daylight responsive lamps and luminaires. The AS7225 arrives pre-calibrated, and is designed for rapid integration into white-tunable and daylight responsive luminaire designs, delivering directives to the local microprocessor via serial or I²bus. Sensor integration plus closed loop control enables lower precision system components to produce a higher-quality tunable white luminaire or replacement lamp.

Light Management Units
Highly integrated, flexible lighting management ICs support nearly all the illumination tasks performed in mobile phones.
Light Management Units description
The standard backlight and keypad lighting functions are enabled in a flexible way by either a charge pump or an inductive step-up converter. The ICs come with a sophisticated, autonomous pattern generator which produces cool event and fun light patterns. They also support new features such as ambient light sensing and daylight sensing.
 Some of the products offer light-to-audio synchronization for use in phones with a media playing capability. The lighting management product portfolio meets the space, feature and cost requirements of all phones from entry-level products up to high-end smartphones.
