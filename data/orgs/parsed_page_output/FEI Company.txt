The History of Cryo-EM
Cryo-possesses a long history that includes many groups of researchers who contributed to the evolution and revolution of cryo-in equally important ways. It has taken 40+ years of dedicated work for the structural biology community to develop the myriad technological advancements—detectors, automation, software and more—that have made modern cryo-possible. 
An Introduction to Cryo-EM
Cryo-Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) begins with vitrification, in which the protein solution is cooled so rapidly that water molecules do not have time to crystallize, forming an amorphous solid that does little or no damage to the sample structure (a process known as vitrification). The sample is then screened for particle concentration, distribution and orientation. Next, a series of images is acquired, and two-dimensional classes are computationally extracted. In the final step, the data is processed by reconstruction software, yielding accurate, detailed, 3models of intricate biological structures at the sub-cellular and molecular scales. These models can reveal interactions that were impossible to visualize previously, a key to scientific results.

The Rise of Cryo-EM
One of the greatest advantages of cryo-relative to conventional structural biology techniques is its ability to analyze large, complex and flexible structures. Oftentimes these cannot be crystallized for X-ray crystallography (XRD) or are too large and complex for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. These include many biologically important proteins, especially those with variable or flexible structures like membrane proteins. The established methods for structure determination, and NMR, are now routinely integrated with cryo-density maps to achieve atomic-resolution models of complex, dynamic molecular assemblies.
Since the first model based on cryo-reconstruction was deposited with the (Protein Data Bank) in 1997, the number of deposited structures has grown exponentially. Cryo-was responsible for entries to the surpassing 1,000 in 2016, with a quarter of all entries deposited that year alone. Many of these most recent depositions include critical macromolecular assemblies previously thought impervious to structure determination.
2017 Nobel Peace Prize for Chemistry
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2017 was awarded to three researchers who had spent decades advancing cryo-EM:
In 1975, Joachim Frank began work on the algorithms that would analyze fuzzy 2images and reconstruct them into sharp 3structures. 
In the early 1980s, Jacques Dubochet succeeded in vitrifying water, which allowed the biomolecules to retain their shape in a vacuum.
In 1990, Richard Henderson was the first to use an electron microscope to generate a 3image of a protein at atomic resolution.
Congratulations to Dr. Jacques Dubochet, Dr. Joachim Frank, and Dr. Richard Henderson.  We are extremely proud of what these researchers and the structural biology community have achieved.
Resolution Revolution
Cryo-now regularly breaks the 3Å barrier, allowing for high-resolution solving of structures that are impossible (or nearly so) with the traditional techniques of and Thermo Fisher Scientific pioneered this modern “ Resolution Revolution ” era of cryo-with its introduction of the Titan Krios™ transmission electron microscope in 2008. Recent technological advancements in the microscope design and imaging hardware, along with     enhanced image processing and automation, have helped to catapult the technique’s success. Many leading scientists have recently adopted the technique as one of the most critical tools in their laboratory. This increase in adoption, along with an     unprecedented sharp rise in associated publications, led to Nature Methods naming cryo-as its Method of the Year for 2015 .

Structure of the 40S-ABCE1 post-splitting complex in ribosome recycling and translation initiation.
Heuer, Gerovac, Schmidt, Trowitzsch, Preis, Kötter, Berninghausen, Becker, Beckmann, Tampé
The essential ATP-binding cassette protein ABCE1 splits 80ribosomes into 60and 40subunits after canonical termination or quality-control-based msurveillance processes. However, the underlying splitting mechanism remains enigmatic. Here, we present a cryo-structure of the yeast 40S-ABCE1 post-splitting complex at 3.9-Å resolution. Compared to the pre-splitting state, we observe repositioning of ABCE1's iron-sulfur cluster domain, which rotates 150° into a binding pocket on the 40subunit. This repositioning explains a newly observed anti-association activity of ABCE1. Notably, the movement implies a collision with A-site factors, thus explaining the splitting mechanism. Disruption of key interactions in the post-splitting complex impairs cellular homeostasis. Additionally, the structure of a native post-splitting complex reveals ABCE1 to be part of the 43initiation complex, suggesting a coordination of termination, recycling, and initiation.

Cryostructures of membrane pore and prepore complex reveal cytolytic mechanism of Pneumolysin.
van Pee, Neuhaus, D'Imprima, Mills, Kühlbrandt, Ö. Yildiz
Many pathogenic bacteria produce pore-forming toxins to attack and kill human cells. We have determined the 4.5 Å structure of the ~2.2 MDa pore complex of pneumolysin, the main virulence factor of Streptococcus pneumoniae, by cryoThe pneumolysin pore is a 400 Å ring of 42 membrane-inserted monomers. Domain D3 of the soluble toxin refolds into two ~85 Å β-hairpins that traverse the lipid bilayer and assemble into a 168-strand β-barrel. The pore complex is stabilized by salt bridges between β-hairpins of adjacent subunits and an internal α-barrel. The apolar outer barrel surface with large sidechains is immersed in the lipid bilayer, while the inner barrel surface is highly charged. Comparison of the cryopore complex to the prepore structure obtained by electron cryo-tomography and the x-ray structure of the soluble form reveals the detailed mechanisms by which the toxin monomers insert into the lipid bilayer to perforate the target membrane.

Structure of deformed wing virus, a major honey bee pathogen.
Škubník, Nováček, Füzik, Přidal, Paxton, Plevka
The worldwide population of western honey bees (Apis mellifera) is under pressure from habitat loss, environmental stress, and pathogens, particularly viruses that cause lethal epidemics. Deformed wing virus (DWV) from the family Iflaviridae, together with its vector, the mite Varroa destructor, is likely the major threat to the world's honey bees. However, lack of knowledge of the atomic structures of iflaviruses has hindered the development of effective treatments against them. Here, we present the virion structures of determined to a resolution of 3.1 Å using cryo-electron microscopy and 3.8 Å by X-ray crystallography. The C-terminal extension of capsid protein VP3 folds into a globular protruding (P) domain, exposed on the virion surface. The domain contains an Asp-His-Ser catalytic triad that is, together with five residues that are spatially close, conserved among iflaviruses. These residues may participate in receptor binding or provide the protease, lipase, or esterase activity required for entry of the virus into a host cell. Furthermore, nucleotides of the genome interact with VP3 subunits. The capsid protein residues involved in the binding are conserved among honey bee iflaviruses, suggesting a putative role of the genome in stabilizing the virion or facilitating capsid assembly. Identifying the RNA-binding and putative catalytic sites within the virion structure enables future analyses of how and other iflaviruses infect insect cells and also opens up possibilities for the development of antiviral treatments.

Structural Basis of Polymerase Transcription Initiation.
Engel, Gubbey, Neyer, Sainsbury, Oberthuer, Baejen, Bernecky, Cramer
Transcription initiation at the ribosomal promoter requires polymerase (Pol) and the initiation factors Rrn3 and core factor (CF). Here, we combine X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to obtain a molecular model for basal Pol initiation. The three-subunit binds upstream promoter DNA, docks to the Pol I-Rrn3 complex, and loads into the expanded active center cleft of the polymerase. unwinding between the Pol protrusion and clamp domains enables cleft contraction, resulting in an active Pol conformation and synthesis. Comparison with the Pol system suggests that promoter specificity relies on a distinct "bendability" and "meltability" of the promoter sequence that enables contacts between initiation factors, DNA, and polymerase.
