curing  refers to the unique way in which adhesives, coatings and inks are dried using “energy" from light sources rather than using heat or evaporation. If you drive a car, use a smart phone, or drink bottled water—all these objects have been "cured" using ultraviolet (UV) light.
About In 2002, pioneered the use of  for curing  applications using the polymerization process to cure inks, coatings, adhesives and other sensitive materials. As the market leader, we are focused 100% on curing with technology. has worldwide sales and support capabilities across regional locations.
has the broadest portfolio of air- and water-cooled offerings. To ensure industry leading quality, reliability engineering  is at our core. Our extensive reliability testing includes highly accelerated life testing, temperature, and vibration assessments to ensure products are rugged and reliable in even the harshest industrial curing environments.  products surpass 60,000 hours of lifetime .
