Our Committment to Swine Health 
An animal health company should provide more than just products to help its customers.
 That’s why the Vetmedica, Inc. (BIVI) Swine Division is dedicated to providing both effective vaccines and practical, research-proven solutions that prevent disease and result in healthier, productive pigs.
Start healthy. End strong.
Disease prevention can make or break a pig’s performance, because healthier pigs reach heavier weights. In fact, we have found that pigs receiving vaccines and raised with other disease prevention protocols weigh more than their less healthy counterparts. Which means if you’re not preventing, you’re not profiting as much as you could.

The most common side effects reported in field studies were vomiting and soft stool/diarrhea. These are usually mild, but may be serious. If side effects occur, pet owners should halt therapy and contact their veterinarian. Pets should be evaluated for pre-existing conditions and currently prescribed medications prior to treatment with METACAM, then monitored regularly while on treatment. Concurrent use with another NSAID, corticosteroid, or nephrotoxic medication should be avoided.
