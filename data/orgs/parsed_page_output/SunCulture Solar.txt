Impact:  SolPad was founded with a humanitarian mission in mind, to provide cost-effective and flexible power alternatives to people living in expensive power regions around the world.  Multiple years of R&have led to a different approach than most traditional companies, combing a robust + Storage system that has proven to be an ideal solution for everything from small commercial installations to hurricane damaged areas such as Puerto Rico.  In our efforts to assist the residents of Puerto Rico, SolPad has acquired $61m in Purchase Orders from two of the most reputable and largest installers on the island and will soon begin deployment of these life-saving systems.  SolPad offers long-lasting renewable energy solutions that can start on a very small scale (one to two panels and batteries for backup power) and then easily scale to entire whole home energy or commercial systems.  The potential to assist the military, relief organizations, businesses and the average energy consumer are limitless.
