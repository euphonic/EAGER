Page Intro Text
At Milliken, we believe ethical behavior is the right thing to do as an organization and as a community. As a long-held, core value of our and our shareholders, it is the foundation of our lasting business success. Honesty, integrity, and ethical behavior are the responsibility of every associate. We must conduct ourselves in accordance with the highest business standards, provide safe environments for our associates, and manufacture with sustainable practices.  How we achieve success is as important as the success we achieve.
The Code of Conduct is our guide to ethical business behavior.  It cannot address every situation or circumstance, but it can be summarized in one simple idea: “Do what is right.”  We do not simply follow the letter of the law; we follow and exceed the spirit of the law.
If at any time you believe our company’s values of honesty, integrity, and ethical behavior, or compliance with the law may be at risk, you must bring the situation to the attention of the through your immediate manager, Human Resources, or Legal Department.  You may also anonymously report your concerns through the Ethics Help Line. ​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
