Corporate responsibility
believes a company’s corporate responsibility is to continuously improve through our actions to make a positive impact on society. As a technology company, we want our stakeholders and employees motivated and excited to work for a responsible company and design products that can change the world.
believes that, by building on innovation and providing technologies that directly address societal demands, some of the most exciting times for lie ahead. will continue to carry out corporate responsibility and do our best to be good corporate citizens for the future. We believe the industry is poised to take on new challenges. Using the latest technologies, which produce tiny circuits that can perform advanced functions with relatively low power consumption. Our industry can help address some of the most compelling challenges we face as a society. Issues relating to energy efficiency, mobile populations, national and personal security, and caring for the health of a growing and rapidly aging world population.
In particular, our industry has the potential to directly address our dependence on fossil fuels and minimize carbon emissions. Semiconductors are already reducing the power consumption of server farms and making consumer appliances operate more efficiently. They’re also accelerating the deployment of:
Energy efficiency
Dependence on fossil fuels and minimize carbon emissions
Caring for the health of a growing and rapidly aging world population
Reduce the power consumption of server farms
Enabling the shift to hybrid and electric vehicles
Making consumer appliances operate more efficiently
Accelerating the deployment of energy-saving lighting technologies
It is our collective responsibility, as an industry, to continue this trend of being proactive as we create value for consumers, the environment, and society as a whole.
We welcome comments ( csr@nxp.com ) and will continue to monitor feedback and consider changes for future reports.
Significant changes have influenced our reporting:
2015 Sold the bipolar business which includes the Jilin China factory
2015 Divested the division
2015 merged with 2017 Divested the Standard Products Business
conducts assessments that aim to align corporate responsibility goals with NXP’s business objectives. We incorporate feedback to inform us of the key corporate responsibility issues and their impact on our business. In defining these focus areas, we interviewed our stakeholders, researched best practices in the industry, studied the legislative landscape and reviewed the results from our participation in various industry associations.
As a result, each category that we report on meets three criteria:
Is greatly significant
Has a current or potential impact on the company
matter over which we, as a company, have a reasonable degree of control
Some of the issues that we have determined to be of most material value are Social, Environmental, and Supply Chain Responsibility. Such topics that we believe are of greatest interest to our stakeholders, who want to make informed decisions about NXP’s environmental and social performance are:
Carbon footprint reduction
Conflict minerals
Human rights
The Social Responsibility and Boards have executive-level members representing operations and business groups. The Social responsibility and Boards establishes the strategy and sets targets, while the sustainability and office performs operational functions. These targets include managing environmental, health, and safety conditions, overseeing the management of chemicals, monitoring and controlling sustainability-related data, supporting customers and contracts, coordinating social investment, liaising with industry associations, and delivering internal and external communications on sustainability.
The sustainability office meets regularly with the boards to discuss and review NXP’s and our supplier’s performance. Any issues of non-conformance are handled in the sustainability office and if needed, issues are escalated to the board.

matter over which we, as a company, have a reasonable degree of control
Some of the issues that we have determined to be of most material value are Social, Environmental, and Supply Chain Responsibility. Such topics that we believe are of greatest interest to our stakeholders, who want to make informed decisions about NXP’s environmental and social performance are:
Carbon footprint reduction
Conflict minerals
Human rights
The Social Responsibility and Boards have executive-level members representing operations and business groups. The Social responsibility and Boards establishes the strategy and sets targets, while the sustainability and office performs operational functions. These targets include managing environmental, health, and safety conditions, overseeing the management of chemicals, monitoring and controlling sustainability-related data, supporting customers and contracts, coordinating social investment, liaising with industry associations, and delivering internal and external communications on sustainability.
The sustainability office meets regularly with the boards to discuss and review NXP’s and our supplier’s performance. Any issues of non-conformance are handled in the sustainability office and if needed, issues are escalated to the board.
