About the IIN
In 2000, Northwestern made the bold, strategic decision to establish the International Institute for Nanotechnology (IIN), the first institute of its kind in the country. Today, the represents and unites more than $1 billion in nanotechnology research, educational programs, and supporting infrastructure.
Led by 
Chad Mirkin
, world-renowned nanoscience expert and the George Rathmann Professor of Chemistry, the has a deep talent pool that includes 19 members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, or the National Academy of Medicine. 
One of Northwestern’s largest collaborative efforts, 
brings together more than 240 chemists, engineers, biologists, physicians, and business experts, from across the University to focus on society’s most perplexing problems. But the IIN’s influence extends far beyond the Northwestern campus. It has developed collaborative partnerships with academic institutions in 30 countries, as well as with more than a dozen federal agencies and over 100 corporations.
The has also had an economic impact. Since its inception, more than 2,000 products and systems have been commercialized worldwide. Twenty-three start-up companies have been launched based upon research, attracting over $1 billion in venture capital funding.
The embodies an extraordinary combination of scientific capabilities, outreach programs, and partnerships that provide a unique and fertile ground for making substantial contributions to the field and ensure that the remains a world leader in nanotechnology.
If we want to make and sell the best products, we have to invest in the best ideas, just like you do at Northwestern. Your Nanotechnology Institute doesn’t just conduct groundbreaking research; that research has spun off 20 startups and more than 1,800 products, and that means jobs.
