About the IIN
In 2000, Northwestern made the bold, strategic decision to establish the International Institute for Nanotechnology (IIN), the first institute of its kind in the country. Today, the represents and unites more than $1 billion in nanotechnology research, educational programs, and supporting infrastructure.
Led by 
Chad Mirkin
, world-renowned nanoscience expert and the George Rathmann Professor of Chemistry, the has a deep talent pool that includes 19 members of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, or the National Academy of Medicine. 
One of Northwestern’s largest collaborative efforts, 
brings together more than 240 chemists, engineers, biologists, physicians, and business experts, from across the University to focus on society’s most perplexing problems. But the IIN’s influence extends far beyond the Northwestern campus. It has developed collaborative partnerships with academic institutions in 30 countries, as well as with more than a dozen federal agencies and over 100 corporations.
The has also had an economic impact. Since its inception, more than 2,000 products and systems have been commercialized worldwide. Twenty-three start-up companies have been launched based upon research, attracting over $1 billion in venture capital funding.
The embodies an extraordinary combination of scientific capabilities, outreach programs, and partnerships that provide a unique and fertile ground for making substantial contributions to the field and ensure that the remains a world leader in nanotechnology.
If we want to make and sell the best products, we have to invest in the best ideas, just like you do at Northwestern. Your Nanotechnology Institute doesn’t just conduct groundbreaking research; that research has spun off 20 startups and more than 1,800 products, and that means jobs.
-President Barack Obama

Mission
The development of nanomaterials and nanodevices as diagnostics and therapeutics for different forms of cancer.
Advanced knowledge of cancer biology to control metastases
Pay-off
More efficacious diagnostic and targeted therapeutic to control and eliminate cancer cells.
Researchers are studying the ways in which cancer cells migrate from existing tumors to create new ones in the body. By creating the micrometer scaled adhesive islands on gold surfaces, they see individual metastatic cells take on shapes like the star depicted on the front. These shapes provide cues to cancer cell motility.

Commercialization Program
Academic exploration in the field of nanotechnology is often driven by federal and state investment with the hope that this investment will bear fruit in the marketplace.
The IIN's Small Business Entrepreneur's Evaluation (SBEE) program provides a platform for scientists and engineers to present their newly developed technologies and receive assistance in the development of viable business plans.
Through this program, faculty members are offered the opportunity to present their marketable technology to an audience of students from the Kellogg School of Management, who, then, may use this as a springboard for writing a complete business plan. The success of the program is evidenced by the formulation of 20 start-up companies since the inception of the who have raised over $700 million in venture capital to date.

About David Kabiller
David Kabiller, a Northwestern trustee and alumnus, is co-founder and head of business development at Capital Management, an investment firm with $185in assets under management. David is a member of Northwestern University’s Board of Trustees, Chairman of the Executive Council of the University’s International Institute for Nanotechnology (IIN), and has been a guest lecturer at the Kellogg Graduate School of Management, and Harvard Business School.
 He founded the Kabiller Prize and the Kabiller Young Investigator Award for researchers in nanoscience and nanomedicine in 2015. He is dedicated to supporting innovative research and technology, and has been an active supporter of the cross-disciplinary field of nanotechnology.
These awards were established not only to recognize the people who are designing the technologies that will drive innovation in nanomedicine, but also to educate and shine a light on the great promises of nanomedicine.

Nanotechnology Corporate Partners (NCP) Program
In today’s competitive business environment, industry is finding it necessary to cut back on research endeavors. Yet the need to stay on the leading edge of technology is undiminished. University researchers and industry have critical resources to offer each other, but sometimes need a program that can help link them together. The Nanotechnology Corporate Partners (NCP) Program at the creates that link. participants benefit from ongoing multi-level interaction with faculty, staff and students, thereby strengthening their relationships with one of the world’s leading centers for nanotechnology research. Partners gain exposure to a broad spectrum of research applications and interact with a pool of highly talented potential employees. As a member of the program, your organization receives a mechanism for closer interaction between academic and corporate researchers to further mutual goals.
