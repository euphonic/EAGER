What We Do
Systems (KPS) has developed a low-cost, flexible duration  - long or short - flywheel energy storage system (FESS), also known as a mechanical battery, that provides non-toxic, environmentally friendly for up to 30 years with little maintenance required.
How We Do It
Constant innovation and hard work are behind our We've managed to create our own technology and designs for our high speed hybrid composite flywheel system, which allows us to drive our costs down without sacrificing efficiency. 
Why We Do It
We strongly believe energy storage to be essential for more widespread renewable energy adoption. We are committed to the development of technology that can put us all one step closer to a clean future for all generations to come.
Our Core Technology and Key Advantages
Innovative Design
Our patented design has been tested and proven to provide long duration energy delivery in several prototype systems. is constantly developing new innovations to further our technology and its applications.
High Speed / Small Volume
KPS's high speed hybrid composite carbon fibre flywheel is much smaller than other similar steel flywheels, decreasing instalation costs and making it suitable for commercial and residential applications.
Unique Bearing Technology
The RingLubeâ„¢ bearing technology is an efficient alternative to magnetic bearing systems without suffering from standby losses.
