Want to Be a Model
Having a pretty face doesn’t necessarily mean you have what it takes to make it as a model.
There are so many more factors involved in being a successful model. The first is being realistic about what type of modelling you will suit.
For example a client looking to book a model for a catwalk show will be looking for someone totally different to a client booking a model for a catalogue.
There is no right or wrong look it is about deciding what category of modelling your face and body would suit. Just as fashion trends change so do trends for models. The great thing about this means that model agencies are always looking for something different so don’t be disheartened if your look is not similar to the girls you currently see in fashion magazines.
