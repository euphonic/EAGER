About Us
The team has over 35 years of experience in high precision tooling and injection molding for cutting-edge technology and medical device companies. We began as a high end custom injection molder in 1984 in Upland, California. Maintaining our high standard of quality, we expanded to Tecate, Baja California, Mexico in 1988 due to a large customer demand. Located two miles south of the border, we began with 10 molding machines. Today, with the Upland plant now closed, we operate with 55 molding machines, a Class 8 clean room, a state-of-the-art metrology lab, quality and production monitoring system and our private freight and trucking delivery service. Our buildings are C-compliant.
