Innovating at every stage of the product continuum.
Our Vision
To enhance the lives of patients worldwide
One company. Many dimensions. 
When Greatbatch,™ Inc. and Lake Region Medical™ merged in October of 2015, we became one of the world’s largest medical device outsource manufacturers. Marking this major milestone, we reintroduced ourselves as Integer Holdings Corporation and became Integer™.
There is great purpose in words and how we use them to identify who we are. “Integer” simply means complete, whole or comprehensive, and ideally represents the union of our brands—Greatbatch, Lake Region Medical and Electrochem™. It also exemplifies our more comprehensive product and service offerings, as well as a new dimension in our combined capabilities.
And though we’re a complete company now, together with our partners, we see opportunity to create new dimensions of Integer in the future.
