Systems, Inc.         History
was incorporated         in October 1981 under the name Quartz Engineering and Materials, Inc.,         and had its initial public offering listed on in August 1983. In         1984 acquired ATMOSCAN® patent from Intel, leading to         development of its worldwide marketing channel and leading-edge         semiconductor fabricators as customers. In 1992 the Company developed         and sold its first Automation product and in 1994 started its         European operations with the founding of Tempress Systems, known for         its quality diffusion furnaces.
acquired Hoffman in         1997, an industry leader in double-sided lapping and polishing         machines, carriers and waxless mount templates for single-side         polishing of semiconductor silicon wafers. In 2004, acquired         Bruce Technologies, a manufacturer of horizontal diffusion furnaces and         for the semiconductor industry. With the acquisition of Bruce         Technologies, became the world market leader in horizontal         diffusion furnace. In 2007 the Company acquired R2Ingenierie, an         automation and wafer transfer company, and in 2014 SoLayTec, which         provides Atomic Layer Deposition (“ALD”) to support         Amtech’s growing solar business. From 2008 through 2009         expanded its solar product portfolio to include and Dry-Etch         tools, in addition to its solar diffusion furnace. In 2015, the Company         expanded its thermal processing capability with the acquisition of         International. Today is one of the market leaders in solar         diffusion and is rapidly becoming a technology turnkey supplier to the         diffusion, PSG, and markets.
