Our Mission
About Electronics, Our Reputation
is proud that our customers have recognized us as a "Top Manufacturer" on many occasions s1964. We continue to earn this recognition because of our better than expected:
Product quality
On-time delivery
Technical expertise
Customer relations
Our Quality
has professionals in a variety of disciplines.
​
Our engineers assure the best possible designs based upon the latest technological developments in materials, processes, and packaging. They interface with our customer's mechanical and electrical design personnel and produce optimum capacitor designs in minimum response time.
​
Our quality experts are involved in all stages of new product development to ensure delivery of the industry's finest products. This includes grading mica-paper, initial inspection of all incoming materials, and final inspection of finished parts.
​
Our testing professionals perform 100% inspection for capacitance, dissipation factor, and dielectric-withstanding voltage on both capacitor sections and finished parts. They also carry out insulation-resistance, and corona, burn-in, life-test, X-ray, and thermal-shock tests, if required.
​
Our research-and-development technicians constantly strive to develop materials and processes to meet the ever-evolving demands of high-voltage electronics. They continuously evaluate new and old materials, processes, techniques, and equipment, as well as create and evaluate new capacitor designs.
