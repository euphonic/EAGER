NthDegree's printed materials currently address lighting. These devices are printed in three basic processes, starting with standard wafers. These respective wafers are then cut into micro LEDs devices the same size as ink particles and are suspended into inks for printing. Finally, the inks are printed on commercial printing presses producing the end product: Nth Light® printed lighting goods.
