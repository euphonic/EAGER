Our Work in HIV

                           Since the first products became available nearly three decades ago, we have worked to expand access to our medicines, build healthcare infrastructure, and address health and development challenges around the world.

30-YEAR
 HIV/AIDS
In the mid-1980s, began its clinical research in response to what the company perceived as a potential epidemic – our scientists were among the first to discover and develop medicines for the treatment of Today, a future where HIV/can be a manageable illness is closer, in part, because of Merck’s response to the crisis.

Pursuing Innovation
 in Research
Dr. George Hanna, M.D., vice president, Research Laboratories, shares why our company has never stopped being committed to developing meaningful innovations to fight and help people living with the disease.

We continue to explore ways to enhance access to our medicines, particularly in the developing world, and through partnerships that seek to strengthen health systems to better deliver prevention and treatment services. Clearly, the need is too great for any one stakeholder to address, requiring coordinated efforts among many. We are committed to working with governments, donors, innovative and generic manufacturers, multilateral organizations and civil society to address the full range of factors affecting access.

Living with HIV
“

                                   I’m sorry to tell you this…you’ve tested positive for HIV.
”
The year was 1995, but Community Liaison Catherine Elliott remembers it as though it happened yesterday.

HEALTH
Curiosity, inventiveness, and a passion for excellence. These are qualities that drive people to discover what’s possible as they work to help improve health around the world.

"It's Personal" Series
"Women in Science" Series
Faces of the Future
"For every question, there’s really an answer, you sometimes just have to spend a little bit more time thinking about it and take a step back and look at what’s actually in front of you."
James Fells
"In our labs and across the industry, we are seeing how human genetics can help determine if a patient will respond to a certain medication."
Caroline Fox
"came here because science and innovation drive this company. believe that my best day at work — the day my team makes a potentially life-changing discovery — is still ahead of me. It’s the reason why stay."
Rob Garbaccio
"As a scientist, there's nowhere else like to work. can do basic research, apply it to an important problem, and see the results. How can you get better than that?"
John Howe
"We get to invent every single day, sometimes it’s little things, sometimes it's big things."
Stephanie Barrett
"We are trying to understand biology in new and different ways to find new targets for drug discovery."
Luis Zúñiga
"think diverse teams are certainly our strongest teams, and think we, as women, have a lot to add."
Rebecca Ruck
"My first-hand experience with neurological diseases gives me the passion and motivation to go out and try to tackle really hard questions."
Angela Jablonski
"As scientists, we have the flexibility to ask the big questions, the important ones that will come into play 5 to 10 years from now. These are the kind of questions that will drive innovation."
Dan Cua
"We are all inquisitive, ambitious, and hard-working. The caliber of science that’s discussed just in the hallway or at a water cooler is incredible. And, it's inspiring to know that our ideas can be supported by Merck’s resources and technology."
Gokul Swaminathan
"Everybody comes to work from a different place...We want to use that unique perspective to further the business."
Jay Schiller
"At Merck…feel that whatever path want to carve for my career, it’s possible."
Harriet Johnson
"The people work with have become my family. There's a strong sense of camaraderie, especially within and our neuroscience department."
Paige Cramer
"What’s most exciting to me is having the flexibility to explore completely new areas of disease biology."
Daria Hazuda
"feel fortunate that I've been able to work on the basic science end of our fight against HIV."
Dr. Michael Thien
"We try never to forget that medicine is for the people."
George "enjoy impacting how other people do scientific research and allowing them to take what we’ve learned and apply it to their own situations and their own problems."
Chris Kistler
"What’s so cool about working at is that the problem solving we do, using cutting-edge research and science, results in positive impact to people's lives and their quality of life."
Jason Cheung
"To have the opportunity to do the research that do day-to-day here as well as the luxury of being able to do research on the International Space Station makes me feel incredibly lucky."
Paul Reichert
"What is most exciting is to be able to invent a new sort of chemical reaction one day, and use it in drug discovery the next day. And that’s just something that doesn’t happen in academia."
Spencer Dreher
"job at is not just a job, it's a career. The company has a commitment to you and to your future."
Daisy Richardson
"For every question, there’s really an answer, you sometimes just have to spend a little bit more time thinking about it and take a step back and look at what’s actually in front of you."
James Fells

HISTORY
We've done great things in the past.
Today, we're doing great things for the future.
Meeting tomorrow’s health care challenges will require more of the same dedication that has made us a leader in the health care industry. This video, created to celebrate our 125th anniversary, highlights our past discoveries and our promises for the future.

							Since 1891, our researchers have helped to find new ways to treat and prevent illness — from the discovery of vitamin B1, to the first measles vaccine, to cold remedies and antacids, to the first statins to treat high cholesterol. Our scientists have also helped develop many products to improve animal health, including vaccines and antibiotics. Today, as a premier research-intensive biopharmaceutical company, we’re focused on making important scientific advancements within hepatitis C, HIV, diabetes and immuno-oncology.
						

							While we are proud of our past, we are enthusiastic about the future. We aim to create a healthier, brighter future for people around the world.

Forward-Looking Statement
Forward-Looking Statement of Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, 
This website of Co., Inc., Kenilworth, NJ, (the “company”) includes “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based upon the current beliefs and expectations of the company’s management and are subject to significant risks and uncertainties. There can be no guarantees with respect to pipeline products that the products will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that they will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.
                
Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors, including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation in the United States and internationally; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances, new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development, including obtaining regulatory approval; the company’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of the company’s patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation, including patent litigation, and/or regulatory actions.
