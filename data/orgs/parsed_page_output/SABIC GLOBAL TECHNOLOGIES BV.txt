Our vision on REACH
Chemicals are the cornerstone of our society. While we realize that chemicals are essential to our contemporary way of living, at the same time we have to take care to produce and use them in a safe way. As a responsible manufacturer and importer of chemicals, cares for the safety and health of people and the environment, and compliance with is merely a logical step.
will encourage the industry to innovate and either to replace substances of very high concern by suitable alternatives, or use them in a way in which risks are adequately controlled.
fully supports the objectives, which entirely tally with our policy. It is our policy to minimize the risks associated with our production activities and products, and to continuously improve their safety, health, and environmental performance. will cooperate with co-producers, suppliers, and customers to achieve our goals.
is a license to operate and a prerequisite for the European industry to market their products in the The chemicals industry will benefit, as will SABIC, from a single regulatory system for existing and new chemicals. will create a higher level of protection from risks of chemicals for citizens, resulting in human health benefits and lower medical expenses.
will be a challenge for the chemical industry. It will lead to an increase of knowledge and expertise regarding chemical substances with all stakeholders involved. All chemical substances in Europe will be comprehensively documented, including risk assessments. will incorporate this additional information, as far as necessary and appropriate, in the Safety Data Sheets of their products.
registration
is fully committed to supporting and fulfilling the requirements and objectives to ensure continued availability of products for our customers.
has successfully registered all required chemical substances to allow continued manufacture, use, and import of products into the by selected European Legal Entities. Also, is actively preparing for future registration needs, and continues to participate in Substance Information Exchange Forums (SIEFs) and consortia.

CLP
The Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulation (CLP) introduces into the the globally harmonised system for classifying and labelling chemicals. This means that the same system is now used throughout the world. This will enable workers and consumers to become more familiar with the symbols and to get to know the effects of chemicals and know how to use products safely. International trade in chemicals will also be easier, as the standards for transportation and supply will be the same world-wide.
Companies need to notify of the classification and labelling that they use for their chemicals. So far, has received millions of these notifications. The information is freely available on the website ( http://echa.europa.eu/web/guest ).
SVHC
works together with the European Commission and the Member States for the safety of human health and the environment by identifying the needs for regulatory risk management at an EU-wide level. The Member States or (at the request of the Commission) initiate the identification of substances of very high concern and restrictions, and Industry can submit applications for authorisation.
The identification of a substance as Substance of Very High Concern (SVHC) and its inclusion in the Candidate List is the first step of the authorisation procedure.
continually reviews its database of approved raw materials and identifies the use of any of these candidate substances as a raw material to produce finished goods within the or to produce finished goods which brings into the as importer of record. If we were to determine that an is used, all attempts would be made to eliminate the material and/or find a substitute. Any relevant information will be conveyed through updated Safety Data Sheets.

EHSS
Environment
Environment 
National and local jurisdictions’ regulatory requirements are becoming ever more diverse, complex and stringent regarding environmental management. Of course, affiliates globally are required to meet applicable environmental regulatory requirements. Our environmental management system draws upon globally-accepted best practices from all regions, establishing an environmental protection baseline standard to which national and/or local regulation may add.  The majority of our sites are certified to ISO14001 alongside RC14001 certification for chemical manufacturing facilities.
Water Management
Our water program includes assurance of waste water effluent streams, so they are properly characterized, permitted and are compliant with discharge requirements. Waste water management processes focus on upstream contaminant reduction in addition to effluent treatment. All our sites are expected to have storm water pollution programs in place. These plans outline measures, such as inspections, secondary containment, and spill prevention, to minimize the discharge of pollutants in storm water conditions. Training is provided to personnel through general awareness training modules in addition to site-specific training.
We recognize the importance of water resources and pursue water usage reduction efforts across our business. Corporate sustainability goals and dedicated resources help to ensure a reduction in water-usage intensity.
Waste Management
Our planet's resources are finite and we are obliged to use raw materials efficiently.  Where waste is created, we seek re-use options and ensure we are effective management of any residual material. Elements of our waste management program include effective and compliant waste identification, segregation, packaging, labelling, storage and transportation. We routinely review our waste treatment and transportation partners to ensure downstream compliance and effectiveness. All of our sites are encouraged to prevent, reuse, recycle and/or recover/reclaim materials prior to identifying disposal as the appropriate waste path.
Air Emissions
Most of our chemical production facilities around the world have national government specified limits for emissions to the air. Compliance with these limits requires specific expertise, infrastructure and focus on often complex regulations.  Our air emissions compliance program is based on identification and location of emission sources and implementation of emissions reduction steps. Processes and emissions control system are monitored as part of an overall program to ensure that air emissions remain below permitted limits.
Soil and Groundwater
Whilst air, water and – to some extent – waste have received international attention over a long period of time, the potential for releases to soil and groundwater is also increasingly regulated, giving rise to a variety of regulations and standards worldwide. and its affiliates use impervious barriers to protect soil and groundwater where this is required.  Even where not required by regulations, our require facilities to assess the risks to soil and groundwater in order to identify the need for physical structures or barriers to protect soil and groundwater, whilst also prescribing monitoring of system integrity and consideration of systems for groundwater monitoring wells based upon risk. Hence our provisions can exceed local legislation.

journey of achievements 
CREATION
SABIC’s creation by royal decree in September 1976 was a bold step for a developing country. It marked a move into using the by-products of oil extraction to produce value-added commodities – such as chemicals, polymers and fertilizers – for export. These commodities were also intended to develop local downstream industries, and meet the requirements of various market segments. What was once wasted gas flared into the atmosphere is today a valuable resource to produce eco-friendly, lucrative materials for the benefit of humankind.
DEVELOPMENT
During the late 1970s and early 1980s the fishing village of Al-Jubail in eastern Saudi Arabia transformed into a modern industrial city, with the Royal Commission for Jubail and Yanbu building the infrastructure, and building the factories, acquiring technology through joint ventures.
Production from our joint ventures began in 1983 with Hadeed, Al-Bayroni and Ar-Razi, followed by Gas in 1984. Sadaf, Yanpet, Petrokemya, Kemya, Sharq and Ibn Sina began production in 1985, receiving wide media acclaim. 
SABIC’s expansion began in 2002 with the acquisition of DSM’s petrochemical business in Europe, with manufacturing facilities in The Netherlands, Germany and the acquired Huntsman Petrochemicals (UK) in 2006, and renamed it Petrochemicals, adding substantial capacity to it Europe operations. In 2007, acquired Plastics, now its Specialties Strategic Business Unit, opening the way for advanced materials, offering value-added products to customers.
continues to explore investment opportunities, strengthening its production, technological and marketing capabilities, and further consolidating its leadership position in the world.
EMERGENCE
SABIC's growth has never stropped since its inception. In 1985, the company's total production was 6.3 million metric tons, reaching 70.4 million metric tons in 2015. In the span of just 40 years, occupies a prominent position among the world's largest petrochemical companies, with a vision to be the preferred world leader in chemicals.

Our Compliance Culture
CULTURE
recognizes that it can best succeed by having a culture based on integrity, devoted to quality and innovation, and responsible for maintaining high standards for the environment, health and safety, fair employment and sustainability. Our compliance culture and processes are designed to fulfill these goals, and are a core part of our commitment to how we do business.
The framework of our Compliance Culture lies in our 
Code of Ethics
. In 2010, adopted a Code of Ethics that consists of 15 policies covering three broad areas: (a) Our Environment; (b) Our Workplace; and (c) Protecting our Assets. The Code of Ethics requires all employees to obey the law, be honest and trustworthy. These policies reflect our commitment to integrity and corporate citizenship, including our commitment to Responsible Care®, the United Nations Compact, and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.
In addition, we believe there are two fundamental elements to create an effective compliance culture -- leadership engagement and employee commitment. Our leaders are responsible for creating the basic systems of preventing, detecting and responding to compliance issues and for creating a culture of compliance through leading by example. At the same time, each employee is responsible for understanding the compliance risks that impact his/her job. All of our employees are asked to acknowledge their understanding of the Code of Ethics annually and to complete assigned training on the policies contained in the Code of Ethics. We have a responsibility to raise integrity concerns or violations promptly - failure to do so can have significant adverse consequences for our company, ourselves, our fellow employees and the communities in which we live. We strictly prohibit retaliation of any kind against anyone for raising or helping to address an integrity concern.

Management Systems
Management Systems
Clear and comprehensive risk management systems are necessary to ensure that everyone understands and consistently implements the actions and procedures necessary to achieve excellence. To this end, has developed an environmental health, safety and security management system for all and affiliate manufacturing and commercial facilities and operations. The goal of SABIC’s management system, through our Safety, Security, Health and Environmental Management Standards (SHEMS), is to establish a world-class risk and performance framework, focused on the significant aspects we determine through our risk identification processes. The foundation and core principles of are to:
Go beyond compliance
Identify and appropriately manage risks
Provide safe, stable, and compliant operation
Minimize environmental impact
Protect the safety and well-being of our employees
Ensure rigorous, comprehensive security and crisis management systems
Deliver good relationships with the communities in which we operate
Drive continual improvement
These programs are required by, and support, SABIC's strong governance and 
Code of Ethics 
and our 
policy
. All and affiliate manufacturing sites are required to perform regular self-assessments and are periodically audited by off-site teams. Our individual facilities must then develop corrective and preventive actions for any potential issues identified in these self-assessment or audits, which are tracked to completion. continuous improvement drive is central to our thinking and so each year we set new, more stringent goals and objectives to enhance performance. These efforts are evident from the recognition received from industry peers.
In addition to complying with our internal management standard, our programs are certified to comply with key external standards:
Responsible Care® 14001 certification at all chemical manufacturing locations around the world.
14001 certification at all chemical manufacturing plants globally plus many of our other locations.
Management Accountability
Ultimately, and affiliate senior leaders are accountable for the performance of their organizations.  Consistent with this accountability, leaders take responsibility to ensure compliance with regulations in all regions and countries in which we operate our business.  Our leaders are supported by specialists at our manufacturing sites, our regions, our business units, and our headquarters.
Management reviews of performance are conducted periodically by senior leaders and across all levels of the organization and are key to program success for both compliance and performance. The following items, amongst others, are reviewed periodically:
Progress in meeting goals and site-specific objectives and targets
Audit results
Completion of corrective actions
Changes in risks and opportunities

Process Risk Management
The company’s manufacturing facilities involving hazardous operations subject to process safety management regulations have implemented a range of programs to identify and mitigate the risk of fire, explosion and accidental releases of hazardous materials, including: hazard & operability studies; process hazard analyses, standard operating procedures, training, mechanical integrity assessments, management of change procedures, inspections, pre-startup safety reviews, risk assessments and audits. These programs and protocols are consistent with international regulations and standards (e.g. and Seveso) and industry best practices, integrated into a comprehensive process safety management program that is applied across SABIC-affiliated manufacturing facilities globally. We track a number of process safety-related KPI’s to assess our performance in this key area.

We believe it is important not only to meet regulatory requirements, but also to create a culture that goes beyond compliance to one that encourages continuous improvement.

To measure our performance, we use an “rate,” which captures a comprehensive range of incident types, including accidental releases to the environment, process-safety events, occupational health-and-safety injuries, and illnesses and security incidents. The rate is based upon the number of incidents per 200,000 man-hours worked and the severity of the incidents. Since 2005, the combined rate of affiliates has improved by 83 percent, and our overall injury rate has improved by 67 percent.

Principle 1 - Support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights
Ethics & Compliance p. 16 Human Capital Development p. 58
As a member of the United Nations Compact, is dedicated to creating and fostering a culture of respect and fair employment practices that prohibits all forms of illegal discrimination. Our Fair Employment Practices Policy not only requires compliance with all labor and employment laws in each country where we employ people, but also sets a standard of behavior that respects all people. Finally, it requires that employment decisions are based upon merit, capability, performance and other job-related criteria as consistent with local law. All employees are trained every two years on our Code of Ethics. also has a compliance reporting system and strict no-retaliation policy, so that all employees, suppliers, customers and other stakeholders can report compliance concerns to our Legal Department. All credible concerns are promptly investigated and acted upon.
Principle 2 - Noncomplicity in human-rights abuses
Ethics & Compliance p.17 Supply Chain p. 64
As we strive to achieve our 2025 strategy of being the preferred world leader in chemicals, is dedicated to the highest standards of ethical, social and environmental responsibility. Both new and existing suppliers are evaluated and selected for reasons beyond just the price and quality of the product and/or service offered. We also look closely at each supplier’s commitment to provide safe working conditions, to act fairly and ethically, and to use environmentally responsible practices. Our Supplier Due Diligence Program asks suppliers detailed questions about their use of underage and forced labor, working conditions and other inquiries designed to ensure that our supply chain is free from human rights abuses.
Principle 3 - Uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining
In SABIC, the right to join labor unions, workers' councils, or other collective bargaining organizations is granted, in compliance with applicable law. Where labor unions are not permitted by law, offers employees the right to join labor committees, which are representative bodies to address employee concerns with management.
Principle 4 - Elimination of all forms of forced and compulsory labor
Ethics & Compliance p. 16 Supply Chain p. 64
Our Code of Ethics Fair Employment Practices Policy states that we will observe all applicable labor and employment laws wherever we operate, including “the prohibition of forced, compulsory and child labor.” As mentioned above, our Supplier Due Diligence Program also asks suppliers detailed questions about their use of underage and forced labor.
Principle 5 - Effective abolition of child labor
Supply Chain pp. 64, 67
does not employ underage workers. As mentioned above, our Supplier Due Diligence Program asks suppliers to disclose any use of child labor. finding of child labor in Due Diligence would be grounds for non-qualification of that supplier or for mitigating actions to ensure that child labor is not used in the production of goods for SABIC.
Principle 6 - Elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation
Ethics & Compliance p. 16
Our Code of Ethics Fair Employment Practices Policy states that we will observe “those laws that pertain to the elimination of any improper employment discrimination.”
In 2013, hired our first Saudi women in Riyadh. continued its recruitment journey in Jubail and then in Yanbu early 2014. In 2015, a second phase of female recruitment saw our numbers rise to 92 women in the region, 56 of whom are Saudi.”
established a co-op pilot in In 2015, the first batch of 11 selected female college students started four-month internships. Furthermore, by the middle of 2016 we reached a total number of 40 female student interns.
Women’s Network (SWN) facilitates women’s professional development, with regional chapters providing opportunities for women to engage with senior colleagues and enhance their professional exposure. We have chapters in all regions where we operate, including Saudi Arabia, where we have local hubs in Riyadh, Jubail and Yanbu.
Principle 7 - Support a precautionary approach to environmental challenges
Resource and Energy Efficiency, pp. 34-40
The Precautionary Approach is based upon implementation of sound methodologies to assess and manage risks posed by an activity. has integrated risk assessment and risk management practices into our Company processes, including assessment and management of risks to human health, safety, security, and the environment (EHSS). For example, all manufacturing operations are subject to initial and periodic risk assessments. In addition, we include risks in our assessment of the products that we manufacture. Consistent with the Precautionary Principle, these risk assessment practices do not require scientific certainty before cost-effective risk mitigation actions are considered. Our focus on reduction of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) (see below) is a prime example of the Precautionary Approach.
Principle 8 - Undertake initiatives to promote greater environmental responsibility
Resource and Energy Efficiency, pp. 34-40
Our long-term strategy (2025) includes manufacturing footprint goals for greenhouse gases (GHG), energy, water, and material loss to be achieved through process, operating, and technology improvements. Reduction in emissions is a key focus area for the Company. CO2 emissions reductions are being pursued through improvements in our own operations and also improved supply chain logistics and marine transportation fuel switching.
Within our own business, we have established the Manufacturing Center of Excellence (MCE) to share our sustainability efforts across different sites. Through MCE, we have managed to develop a robust data collection and analysis process for our environmental footprint. Many of the local community-based efforts and much of the scientific research we support are designed to promote a culture of environmental conservation.
Principle 9 - Development and diffusion of environmentally friendly Innovation and Sustainability Solutions p. 25, Resource and Energy Efficiency p.40
We have continued the integration of sustainability into our thinking about the product lifecycle, from selection of raw materials, to design and manufacturing, and finally product use and end-of-life. is supporting various customers to enhance their sustainability efforts through the products we produce and we have defined “enabling others to operate more sustainably” as one of our key strategic objectives. has been applying several processes and metrics to the development of innovative sustainability solutions. That includes our Sustainability Product Qualification process, in which a business team nominates products for an initial assessment of their sustainability proposition.
Principle 10 -Work against corruption in all its forms, including extortion and bribery
Ethics & Compliance pp. 16-17
As a manufacturing company, we rely on the ability to move our products across borders around the world each day. Eradicating corruption at points of entry is crucial to our business success. 2016 was an active year for SABIC’s anti-corruption efforts. participated in the Business 20 (B20) Anti-Corruption Forum in Beijing, China in April 2016, the focus of which was to make concrete, actionable endorsements to the governments of the world’s 20 largest economies (G20). Azlan Nageli, SABIC’s Chief Regional Counsel, Asia Pacific, participated in a panel entitled “Sharing Anti-Corruption Experience between Multinational Corporations and Emerging Markets.” In May 2016 held events in Riyadh and Jubail to highlight our efforts around sustainable procurement, including preventing corruption in the supply chain. The events were held with the Siemens Integrity Initiative and the Pearl Initiative – a non-profit organization promoting a corporate culture of accountability and transparency as a key driver of competitiveness across the Gulf region. The Riyadh event was opened by Dr. Ali Al-Kheshaiban, Director of Department of Promotion of Integrity, Nazaha (Saudi National Anti-Corruption Commission). This was followed by a panel session entitled “Attracting International Customers and Investment through Supply Chain Compliance.” Panelists included Khalid Al-Hussan, CEO, Tadawul (Saudi stock market), Ahmed Al-Shangiti, Procurement Services, SABIC, Khalid Al-Aseeri, Legal Advisor, Ministry of Economics & Planning, National Transformation Project, and Andreas Glogowsky, Corporate Account Manager, Siemens. During the session, private sector and government participants, including Dr. Hanan Al-Ahmadi, Shoura Council, heard perspectives on the business imperative for ethical business and why stakeholders - both and regional - are increasingly requesting evidence of good compliance practices in the Saudi supply chain. Speaking at the panel session, Ahmed Al-Shangiti, Vice President, Procurement Services, SABIC, said: “The wealth that comes into Saudi Arabia through the opening of the Tadawul will be directed, at least in part, to those companies that present the lowest business risk. At SABIC, we are reducing risk in the supply chain by requiring our suppliers and vendors to demonstrate that they embrace the same strong compliance culture that our business is built upon. In the future, we will award business to those suppliers and vendors that offer us the best product, lowest price and strongest compliance practices.”
Over 100 suppliers attended to learn about key initiatives from Procurement, including the latest developments in supplier relationship management, supplier compliance and details around our new supplier due diligence program. In order to help our suppliers to develop their own compliance programs, all in attendance were given a takeaway assignment – an online anti-bribery training course that offered in conjunction with Trace International. Training suppliers and other third parties on anti-bribery is a best practice which we are offering to our suppliers in Saudi Arabia to help reinforce our message that strong compliance is a business imperative for SABIC.

STATEMENT
This serves as SABIC’s transparency statement under Section 54 of the UK’s Modern Slavery Act 2015 (the “Act”).
SABIC’s commitment to a strong compliance culture is fundamental to its continued growth as a preferred world leader in chemicals. You will find below details of our policies, procedures and practices aimed at eradicating slavery and human trafficking from our supply chain.
Corporate Structure and Businesses

It has significant research resources, with innovation hubs in five key geographies – USA, Europe, Middle East, South East Asia and North East Asia. Through its affiliates, is a major supplier of thermoplastics, polymers, chemicals and intermediates in the market.
Anti-Trafficking/Slavery Policies
SABIC’s Code of Ethics provides the foundation for our business culture and underscores our commitment to performance with integrity and respect for human rights. The Code of Ethics provides guidelines for employee conduct and affirms our commitment to uphold our core values, such as our commitment to our employees, standards for doing business, and our relationship with our communities. We embrace the Code of Ethics, every day and in every business dealing across the globe. 
Our policy on Third-Party Business Dealings, within the Code of Ethics, includes our responsibility to follow all applicable laws as well as our own internal policies and to require any supplier or third party who works with to comply with similar fundamental principles. In addition, our policy on Fair Employment Practices requires the strict observance of all applicable labour and employment laws wherever operates in the world; this includes supporting the prohibition of forced, compulsory and child labour. 
Supplier Conduct
seeks to do business with socially responsible suppliers that share its commitment to ethics, integrity, and compliance. expects its suppliers to understand and follow its core values and fundamental principles, which are memorialized in the Supplier Code of Conduct . The Supplier Code of Conduct details SABIC’s policy on Fair Employment Practices, and requires that suppliers comply with applicable laws pertaining to the prohibition of forced, compulsory, and child labour. supplier’s failure to follow the Supplier Code of Conduct may result in non-consideration for future business or in termination of an existing relationship.
Anti-Trafficking/Anti-Slavery Due-Diligence Processes
For its supply chain, has established processes in place to vet potential and current suppliers for their involvement in modern slavery and human trafficking; such processes include questionnaires and on-site audits for those suppliers deemed to be in the medium and high risk categories. This compliance due diligence includes, amongst other things, screening of suppliers for the presence of forced and child labour. If we discover evidence of slavery or human trafficking with one of our suppliers through this process, we will refrain from doing business with this supplier and will report such conduct to the relevant authorities, as appropriate. 
Anti-Trafficking/Anti-Slavery Training
All employees receive regular training on the Code of Ethics and related policies, including on fair employment practices. Employees are encouraged to seek compliance guidance from, and to report compliance concerns to, their managers, Legal Affairs, Human Resources and SABIC’s Compliance Helpline Leaders worldwide. Trained personnel investigate all incidents in a timely manner. All credible reports of suspected misconduct are investigated. Confirmed violations are addressed with corrective actions, and may include employee discipline or dismissal.

PROCESSES
We operationalize our compliance culture through a variety of processes and operating rhythms described below:
1. Compliance Helpline Leaders
To promote an atmosphere where our employees feel free to raise concerns without fear of retaliation, we have established a organization of Compliance Helpline Leaders who are responsible for receiving concerns and ensuring that all concerns are properly investigated and addressed. In addition, employees are all trained that they can also raise their concerns with any manager, or with the Human Resources or Legal organizations. The number and type of concerns raised to the Compliance Helpline Leaders are measured and tracked, and are periodically discussed at several regional Compliance Review Boards established by the Company.
2. Compliance Review
For several years, business has conducted a Compliance Review process that is designed to engage our employees to assess compliance processes, prioritize key risks and develop mitigation plans to address those risks. The process includes a Bottoms Up Review during which each exempt Manager must meet with his/her direct reports and cover the following:
a review of each policy in the Code of Ethics;
a review of Bottoms Up output from prior reviews;
a general discussion encouraging employees to freely surface compliance concerns without fear of retaliation.
Each compliance concern that is raised is recorded by the Manager and addressed either during, or within a reasonable time after, the Bottoms Up Review is over.
In 2008 and 2009, the participation rate of the relevant population in the Bottoms Up reviews was over 90 percent The results of the Bottoms Up review are then discussed by management which develops a summary of the issues raised and any other existing and emerging risks that could adversely impact the organization. This process results in the development of risk mitigation or action plans for the highest priority risks. These plans include assigning the responsibility for mitigation actions to particular individuals, with required dates for completion. The progress towards completion of the plans is tracked on a monthly basis, through a digitized system tracker and is also discussed at the periodic meetings of the Compliance Review Boards (see below).
In 2011, initiated a Code of Ethics review for senior-level employees. The new process consists of a Bottoms Up Review of the Code of Ethics in manager-led discussions, with over 2500 employees participating. As with the previous process, the results of these reviews are discussed by management and risk mitigation plans are developed and tracked for the highest priority risks.
In 2012, will institute a bottoms-up compliance review program as well as a review for all enterprise risks.
3. Compliance Review Boards
Oversight of SABIC’s compliance program is performed by a network of regional Compliance Review Boards. These Boards meet periodically to identify any new significant compliance concerns, review the activities of the Compliance Helpline Leaders, and monitor the completion of the integrity training required of our employees.
4. Compliance Training
One way that we try to ensure compliance with our Code of Ethics is to require all employees to be trained on the specific requirements of the Code. In an effort to better equip employees to recognize and respond to increasingly complex compliance challenges, our company’s Legal team developed a comprehensive web-based compliance training program. This program reviews each policy in detail, and includes questions that must be answered correctly to show understanding of the requirements. Currently, our company requires that all employees take four General Awareness courses on the basics of all of the policies. In addition, there are another 31 advanced courses that are more detailed and are assigned to employees based on their roles within the company. This approach allows employees to complete training with particular focus on those compliance policies and practices that pertain most directly to the issues they face in performing their job duties. Our employees are required to take an average of about 15 advanced courses during a two year training cycle. Several of our compliance courses are available in the languages most commonly used by our employees. In 2010, the rate for the completion of required training in was 97 percent for General Awareness courses, and 90 percent for advanced courses. For 2011, the respective completion rates were both over 98 Percent.
Another feature of our compliance training program is the executive level training delivered by our company’s senior leadership, with the support of the Legal team. This training is designed to train senior management on the compliance responsibilities of a leader, emerging compliance risks, how to conduct compliance investigations and a review of our compliance infrastructure. In 2008, 98 percent of the executive staff participated in this program. During 2010, the executive level training was rolled out to businesses outside of the business, and was given to 95 percent of the target audience. Additional Leadership training will be conducted periodically.
In addition to Code of Ethics specific training, we also conduct live training on high-risk areas (e.g. EHSS, International Trade and Antitrust). For example, we track required training in EHSS, and the completion rate for 2008 was 99.8 percent, 2009 was 93.86 percent, and 2010 was 99.39 percent; the training completion rate for training on International Trade Sanctions was 95 percent of the relevant population. In 2010 the training was rolled to businesses outside of and targeted audiences were trained in Anti-dumping, International Trade, Compliance, Antitrust and Intellectual Property. In 2011, over 3500 employees were trained in these risk areas.
5. Supplier Qualification Process And Contracts
We have implemented a program to help ensure that our suppliers adhere to ethical standards and comply to the fundamentals of our Code of Ethics and policies, including: fair employment practices, no underage or forced labor, reasonable hours of work and wages, no discrimination, freedom of association and matters such as providing a safe work environment, pollution prevention, waste minimization and recycling, and safe and secure transportation of materials. We perform due diligence on all direct material suppliers at varied levels dependent on each suppliers’ risk potential. For all suppliers, we undertake inquiries that range from questionnaires, to interviews, to thorough on-site inspections. We have performed reviews of over 2700 suppliers in over 50 countries, including over 700 on-site inspections.
