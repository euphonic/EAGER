A/provides turn-key solutions for drinking water based on any raw water. With our solid experience in designing water treatment plants in sizes ranging from 500 up to 1000+ M3 a day we are able to provide solutions to any environment and need.
In India, we have entered a Joint Venture with a local partner for design, production, sales and O&contracts. We have developed our own range of “Water Kiosk” WK250, WK500 and WK1000 supplying safe and clean drinking water based on a unique filtration and monitoring system. We have also started promoting one of the world’s best mobile de-salination systems for coastal areas and finally we will be able to secure all our installations with a O&contract.
In China, we have developed a “Residential Water Concept” for existing or newly build residential areas where we provide many thousands with safe and clean drinking water directly in the tap. We have started a close cooperation with a solid partner with more than 20 years of experience in the business and we will in 2018 start promoting a new concept for drinking water.
We are a small but highly competent company with our in Denmark. All 4 founders bring in a lot of experience from different industries and markets so we are looking forward to expanding our business in the future.

What are the effects of this?
Water and sanitation- related diseases remain among the major causes of death in children under five; more than 800 children die every day from diarrhoeal diseases linked to poor hygiene.
Proper water and sanitation is a key foundation for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, including good health and gender equality.
By managing our water sustainably, we are also able to better manage our production of food and energy and contribute to decent work and economic growth. Moreover, we can preserve our water ecosystems, their biodiversity, and act on climate change.
