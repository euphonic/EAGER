About CuraCurawas created to develop the medical and commercial potential of a newly discovered technique for the production of therapeutic vaccines for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.
The company was founded by a Belgian medical doctor, Dr. Stéphane Huberty, who himself suffered from myasthenia gravis. The original discoverer of the vaccine production technique, Professor Edwin Blalock is a consultant to CuraVac.
This vaccine is the first in a series. It will be tested on humans suffering from myasthenia gravis (MG). While a not widely known orphan disease, affects more than one in five thousand and its pathology is clearly understood, making it an excellent development model.
Further, Curatherapeutic vaccines will be developed for the treatment of other autoimmune diseases, including multiple sclerosis, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. In total, autoimmune diseases afflict more than five percent of western population.
In 2002, the company was created and acquired the complementary peptide patent. The company raised fund and got organized as a management company in the center of a expertise and competence network of collaborations and sub-contracting companies.
In 2006, the key article showing that the vaccine works not only in lab on rat models but also on naturally occurring myasthenia gravis in pet dogs is published and the vaccine patent in filled.
In 2009, the human formulation of the vaccine is manufactured following and guidelines.
The myasthenia gravis therapeutic vaccine, our first vaccine, was granted Orphan Drug Designation in Europe by a team of 27 independent experts of the 27 European member states.
In 2013, following a call for proposals that was answered by all the best medicine projects in the world, CuraVac’s project for a therapeutic vaccine was one of the 7 therapeutic vaccine projects that were selected by an Independent Jury Committee of the best world experts.
Following a Clinical Trial Authorization received in November 2015, 24 patients are received three injections of the therapeutic vaccine in a phase 1b clinical trial that takes place at the Antwerp University hospital (UZA) in Belgium.A
