News & Announcements
Story of the Present 
and of the Future
The story of Natasha Deleon House is not a story of the past. It’s a story of the present and future. Natasha has a past, a pretty rough one, but she is quietly tenacious, and talks about it matter-of-factly, almost as if dealing with a flat tire. She has roots now, a family, a home, a career, and a great life. Her past is her past. And, she readily credits 
Middle College, Ms. Jackie Epps
 and 
Ms. Mary Jo Washko
, with being the fork in her road that branched her from that past to her future. 
Positive Spirit Simmers in
The Kitchens at Reynolds 
Students past and present will quickly tell you the Reynolds Culinary Arts Program is something special. That alums like Dave Hirshman write to say “Thank you” is a testament to the lasting positive spirit that starts simmering in the Reynolds kitchen during their studies. Years later students recall lessons they learned, their cooking successes and tragedies, and they never fail to remark on how incredibly prepared they were to face the rigors of their culinary careers.
Marvette Richardson
is on Fire
Marvette is a woman with a passion, one she’s been stoking her whole life. And she is on fire. “I’ve always loved helping people. When was young used to take care of my mother. just loved it," Marvette said. "You have to do what you love, and love what you do.” Only love could explain how anyone could put in Marvette’s hours and still have fire and passion

Reynolds Leadership
Welcome to Reynolds Community College, where outstanding careers get started!
Like jazz and baseball, community colleges are a uniquely American invention. We occupy a pivotal role in our country’s educational system, enrolling over ten million students each year – nearly half of the nation’s undergraduates. We have expanded access to higher education at a much lower cost, making education accessible and attainable to communities once excluded from higher education. Community colleges have been referred to as “the great democratization of higher education” and have continued to evolve to better prepare students to be successful in the workforce, or to seamlessly transfer to a college or university – changing lives and livelihoods in the process. truly believe that there is no more exciting and vital place in the entire higher education sector than the community college.
As Reynolds closes in on its 50
th
 anniversary, it’s appropriate to look back at the 346,657 students the college has served since 1972. But we must also look forward to all the lives we’ve yet to transform... Maybe you are an adult learner seeking a degree or a certificate that will lead to a career. Maybe you are the first in your family to attend college... Whatever your path has been, trust that the knowledgeable and professional faculty and staff at Reynolds are ready for you!

Sphinx Mountain above Madsion River on Horizon: from Downing House, 
Ennis, Montana; Mari Lyons; Oil on canvas 
 The image above is part of a gift of 31 works painted by Mari Lyons, a New York City based artist who played a prominent role in the artistic life there.   She began her art education at the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco when she was only 13 years old.  She earned a from Bard College and a from the Cranbrook Academy in Michigan.  Throughout a busy life in New York City, she continued to paint.  Refusing to limit herself to one genre, she created landscapes, cityscapes, portraits and abstracts. 
  This work is among those that will be hung in the in early February.
The Reynolds Collection at Reynolds Community College features works by our students, faculty and staff, as well as acclaimed painters, sculptors and visionaries, including John Bryan, Wolfgang Jasper, Dr. Baxter Perkinson, Gilmore-Bryan,  and  Marilyn West.
These works are strategically placed throughout our three campuses engaging students and guests. Reynolds faculty also often incorporate these works into their classroom pedagogy.
Reynolds will host its annual Student Art Show March 25 - April 30, 2018. The exhibit showcases more than 50 pieces of student art including paintings, drawings, digital media, mixed media and photographs.  This year's juror will be Chuck Scalin, Professor emeritus and former Assistant Chair of the Communications Art + Design Department at Virginia Commonwealth University.  An accompanying exhibit will celebrate the newest gift of original art to the college. The exhibit is displayed in the Gallery of the Workforce Development and Conference Center on the Parham Road Campus.
In discussing student art, Reynolds President Dr. Gary Rhodes notes, “Community colleges house a rich diversity of students. Art provides a unique universal language.”

Reynolds Annual Security Report
©Reynolds Community College is committed to fostering, cultivating, and sustaining a culture of diversity and inclusion.  In the fall of 2015, the Reynolds Diversity and Inclusion Committee (RDIC) was created and charged with identifying strategies, actions, programs and policies to help Reynolds build an inclusive college community and ensure that the demographic statistics of our faculty and staff reflect the demographic statistics of the student population that we serve.  Additionally, the committee establishes annual goals and objectives, conducts regular assessments, and provides an annual report of progress to the chancellor, via the president.
Meaning of diversity and inclusion image
The imagery in the above web banner represents what we, at Reynolds, value when engaging in conversations about diversity and inclusion. We respect one another’s thoughts, words, and actions. And before we speak or act ourselves, we are mindful of our own thoughts, words, and actions … and how these might affect others. This theme was prevalent among our guiding committee members, and in our initial discussions of what diversity and inclusion meant to each of us. We wanted to capture the significance visually, as a bold statement of our beliefs and commitment to this value at Reynolds.
The Reynolds Diversity and Inclusion Committee (RDIC) is made up of a diverse team of faculty and staff representing all employee groups at the college.  Members on the committee are as follows: 
Dr. Gary Rhodes, President (Co-Chair)
Corliss Woodson, Associate Vice President of Human Resources and Officer (Co-Chair)
Amelia Bradshaw, Vice President of Finance and Administration 
Dr. Kimberly Britt, Vice President of Academic Affairs
Kimberly Cain, Fiscal Technician/President – Classified Council;
Alan Crouch, Assistant Dean, School of Business/President – Professional Administrative Faculty Senate
Ann Bushey, Executive Assistant to the President 
Dr. Ghazala Hashmi, Coordinator, Center for Excellence in Teaching & Learning
Dr. Thomas Hollins, Vice President of Student Affairs and Title Coordinator
William Judon, Police Sergeant 
Dr. Maria Poindexter, Manager of Training and Development
Dr. Jason Sampson, Associate Professor of History/President, Faculty Senate
Joe Schilling, Director of Communications/Special Assistant to the President
Kelly Smith, Director of Marketing
Mike Verdú, Director of Facilities Management and Planning 
Mary Waite, Human Resource Manager
Hong Wu, Director, Library and Information Services
How the will address the Chancellor's themes for Diversity and Inclusion: 
Communication and Vision Sharing
In June 2016, Dr. Chris Lee, Associate Vice Chancellor for Human Resource Services, and Ms. Kathryn Haselhorst, Diversity Officer, shared the Chancellor’s vision of diversity and inclusion for Virginia’s community colleges.
Reynolds will communicate the diversity and inclusion message to all Reynolds faculty, staff and students. 
Whenever possible, web and written published images will reflect our diverse student, faculty and staff populations. 
Annual reports will be used to share information with the chancellor, via the college president.
Recruitment and Development
College policy will be updated to strengthen the requirement for having a diverse interview panel and for advertising open positions to seek diversity in applicants applying for all positions.  
Reynolds will increase its use of the Minority Professional Teaching Fellowship Program and the Graduate Student Fellowship Program to increase the minority representation for all faculty recruitment efforts.
Community Engagement
The Diversity and Inclusion Committee will partner with internal groups, like our Multicultural Enrichment Committee, to support and promote college events that demonstrate our commitment to diversity and inclusion.  Many of these events are open to students and to the general public.
Integration
The college's Operational Plan will be used to ensure that every unit incorporates diversity and inclusion in its annual planning. 
Training will be developed for faculty and staff and be presented to the college community beginning in the fall of 2016.
As a proud member of the Virginia Community College System (VCCS), Reynolds supports the Chancellor's Diversity Task Force's Educational Case for Diversity and Inclusion. The report can be found .
The State Board of Community Colleges' Diversity Policy:
The is committed to fostering, cultivating, and sustaining a culture of diversity and inclusion.

Faculty Reward & Recognition
Faculty Reward Recognition
Purpose and philosophy
The Reward and Recognition Plan is intended to honor full-time teaching faculty whose exceptional professional accomplishments, contributions, and activities support the mission of Reynolds and the Virginia Community College System. These individuals promote a vigorous learning environment, and demonstrate extraordinary talent and potential in one or more performance domains: Teaching, Scholarly and Creative Engagement, Institutional Responsibility, and Service.
All full-time teaching faculty at Reynolds are expected to meet high standards of performance expectations as prescribed elsewhere in the annual Faculty Development and Evaluation Plan. However, for faculty who substantially exceed those expectations in one or more domains of faculty activity, Reynolds has designed this Reward and Recognition Plan to provide meaningful and timely recognition of professional excellence.
The Plan is designed to acknowledge and laud exceptional faculty accomplishments, contributions, and activities that support the mission of Reynolds. Because such instances of professional excellence among faculty may be observed by students, adjunct faculty, full-time teaching faculty, staff, or administrators, the Plan provides opportunities for members of the college community to nominate faculty for these awards pursuant to the provisions prescribed herein.  In addition, the Plan offers sufficient flexibility to honor a variety of extraordinary accomplishments, contributions, and activities that are relevant to teaching faculty.
The Reward and Recognition Plan adheres to a culture of evidence, in the belief that a faculty member’s documentary record of exceptional performance should be sufficient to establish the nature and extent of the faculty member’s participation, effectiveness, and achievement for which the reward or recognition is bestowed.
Full-time teaching faculty remain eligible to participate in other reward and recognition programs conducted at Reynolds which are available to all employees.
Faculty Reward and Recognition Committee
The Reynolds Reward and Recognition Plan is administered by the Faculty Reward and Recognition Committee appointed each year by the president of the college.  Full-time teaching faculty comprise a majority of the membership of this committee.
Faculty Reward and Recognition Programs
The Reynolds Reward and Recognition Plan consists of three reward and recognition programs:  the Faculty Star Awards program, the Faculty Challenge Awards program, and the Faculty Awards for Professional Excellence program.  For more information regarding each of these programs, use the buttons at left to select the awards program of interest.
