                        clean healthcare environment is critical to helping reduce the risk of infection. Each year, hundreds of thousands of people die from HAIs (healthcare-aquired infections.) In response, we developed EnCompass, a complete environmental hygiene program to eliminate healthcare-associated pathogens and ensure patient room hygiene. With proper staff training and monitoring, we can help you improve cleaning outcomes and reduce risk.

Insight
Egyptian Fertilizers Company (EFC) is a leading global producer and distributor of high-quality nitrogen fertilizer products and industrial chemicals that provides clean, environmentally sound solutions to its customers. Its Suez plant is one of the largest fertilizer complexes in Egypt, producing 1,400 tons a day of ammonia and 5,000 tons a day of urea. It has four different recirculating cooling water systems designed to manage critical process operations.
Innovation
One of the biggest challenges in open, recirculating cooling systems is a high risk of bacterial proliferation due to ammonia contamination and the high temperature of the cooling tower. This can lead to increased water, energy and chemical consumption as well as: 
Lower production
Heat exchanger failure
Microbiologically induced corrosion
Loss of revenue
Nalco Water provided a comprehensive solution that included on-site expertise and 
Purate™ Technology
, a patented, proprietary chlorine dioxide program that controls biologic growth in cooling towers and other industrial water treatment applications. The treatment program has helped the plant reduce:
Water consumption
Maintenance costs
Corrosion rates
Chemical usage
In addition, overall plant performance has improved, and safety has increased, due to the replacement of volatile chlorine gas with stable and reliable Purate biocide technology.
Purate is your best choice for ClO2. Advantages of Purate include:
No Chlorine Gas. Ever.
Simple Two-Chemical Feed
Reliable and Easy to Operate
Best Total Cost of Operation
