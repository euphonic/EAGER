Our R&challenge - creating original ideas to turn today's dreams into tomorrow's reality
Without new challenges a company cannot grow. values the power of R&as an important asset that leads as we carve a path into the future. While asking ourselves, "What do our customers need now?" and "What is the market looking for?" we continuously engage in research and development to fulfill present demands. All the while we are actively pursuing further research to raise the quality and production efficiency of our previously developed products.
The Triangular Link: Sales, R&and Production

Chemical's R&is being directed in a way that closely suits our customers' needs. What makes this possible is Shin-Etsu's R&system, which integrates business, development and production. Market demands generated by our business activities are relayed to our development divisions, where they are used to establish research themes. The development divisions follow these themes as they progress. At the same time they maintain close ties with the manufacturing divisions and conduct practical R&aimed at utilizing our plants and facilities for mass production. In order to do this efficiently, has established R&centers at each plant, which ties them in closely with each business and manufacturing division.
Materials Development with Originality - Creating New Value
In conducting our R&D, we focus on original themes. Our first goal with these themes is to meet the next generation of needs and, secondly, show originality in doing something that has never been attempted. Some of these carefully selected themes have led to the invention of new materials that we were the first to mass produce. These materials have solved problems in various industrial fields by providing unique properties and excellent functionalities, while leading to industry-changing breakthroughs. We will continue to take on the challenge of developing new materials wherever the need exists.

Because of the presence of these two gifts of nature, Nitrogen Fertilizer Co., Ltd. was founded on September, 1926 to manufacture fertilizer and limestone nitrogen. The history of Co., Ltd. began from this point.The company's "Shin" comes from Shinano and "Etsu" is taken from Echigo.
