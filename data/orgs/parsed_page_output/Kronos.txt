It just blows me away to see the talent and the skills and the level of work ethics that people have and the passion. I'm working with people from Mexico, from India, from Australia, from China. came here for the first time in U.S.. see people from everywhere. has the vision, they have domain in the business, they have a lot of experience, expertise You've got a fantastic product in over a hundred countries. We are a brand of choice. You know you doing something right when your customers want to be referrals for you. You just can't beat it. We do work very hard and there's no question about that. We expect very high performance from our people. We want A-players, but we want those A-players to be effective. Work-life balance is extremely important. They made it very clear to me. Family first. They said, \"Hey if you need to be out for family reasons please go and take care of your family.  We will be here and you will be covered.\" You know, have my work life and have my home life and need to make sure that have a balance between the two and and allows me to do that. I've stayed at as long as have because have the ability to use the creative talents that have in a way that really makes a difference. Every manager has an open-door policy that allows you to walk in, talk about your ideas. The environment gives you the confidence and the allowance to speak. own what do every single day. can be as successful as want to be and do things my own way. The top of people that are very successful in the organization are people that are just willing to work and always willing to give their best because everybody else around you is. No other company really offered me the benefits and the salary that offered me coming out of college. As an intern felt that the people around me wanted me to learn and succeed so really felt comfortable continuing my career here. Even though it is a bigger company than was used to working for it has a small-company feel. You know, you walk down the hall and and you see Aron and he asks how your kids are doing. And the whole company really operates that way. No matter where you are in the world, if you need help you have a whole slew of people that are there to help you. And that whole culture, quite honestly, is built from that from the top down. would recommend anybody to work here. You know I've already recommended my mother to come work here. believe in what we're doing. It's a great place to work. It's a very generous place to work. They make it easy to work here. If you like challenges, really something motivating intellectually. If you want a career and you want to be in an innovative company, incredible company. As far as you want to go with what you want to do you can do that here at Kronos. So it's a wonderful thing."

The Early Years
1977 – 1986
It started with a simple idea from Mark Ain: there had to be an easier way to record employee time transactions. With a team of engineers and a hunger for success, his idea came to life with the first patented microprocessor-based time clock. The time clock automatically recorded, totaled, and reported employee hours, transforming an industry that had not seen innovation in many years.
1977 – Incorporated founded by alum Mark Ain
1979 – Delivered industry’s first microprocessor-based time clock
1983 – Relocated corporate headquarters to Waltham, Mass.
1985 – Introduced PC-based product, Timekeeper Central

Building customer trust through the principles of corporate social responsibility.
At Kronos, we strive to be great people every day by empowering our employees to do great things for our communities and the world.
The Mission
Our promise to our customers, employees, and the world at large is to always strive to meet or exceed ethical, legal, commercial, and public expectations of how a company should conduct business. Through the program, we have developed guidelines for conducting our business that support and align with the values important to our customers, their employees, and communities. These efforts help all of us work toward a world that cares for and empowers all people and protects our planet.
Environment and Sustainability
is not just following a trend — we’re taking the lead on initiatives at our corporate headquarters to protect our environment and create a sustainable workplace for employees. And we’ve been doing it for years. We discovered early on in our company’s history that not only is it the right thing to do — it just makes great business sense.
We’re continually innovating in many areas to become a greener Kronos. Our commitment to environmental responsibility is a shared goal across all our global campuses. Recycling and sustainability efforts are ongoing throughout our entire organization, including cleaning/recycling services, printing/copying, and even in the manufacture of our time clocks. We also limit electricity consumption at our corporate headquarters by leveraging smart lighting, adjusting thermostats, and limiting decorative lighting — reducing our carbon footprint while also saving on operating costs.
These and other initiatives, such as our participation in the Massachusetts Rideshare Program and Massachusetts Governor’s Energy Challenge, have earned us recognition in our community and home state. We’re proud of these accomplishments, but are continually seeking out new ways to extend our environmental and sustainability commitment.
Labor Practices and Human Rights
At Kronos, we believe in leading by example. That’s why we set high standards for respecting the rights of our employees and following fair labor practices — striving to meet compliance to meet the overall needs of the individual, while respecting the geographical considerations and cultural backgrounds of our global workforce.
To create an environment more conducive to work, we support employees through a variety of programs. Our LiveInspired initiatives and benefits reward employees for their contributions to our organization, and nurture their need for a balanced life. It’s a foundational part of the culture and reflects our dedication to the inspiration and innovation that drives our business and enriches the lives of our employees.
This commitment to our employees has helped earn the honor of being consistently ranked as one of the Best Places to Work. And that’s a commitment we’re dedicated to following through on.
Fair Business Practices
We never forget at that our business has moral standards and ethical responsibilities. We strive to be recognized as a company that conforms to law, custom, and human values. That’s why policies related to honesty and fair dealing are written into our Employee Handbook and Company Code of Conduct, and reinforced through annual mandatory employee training.
While ethical behavior may often be a matter of law, we believe it is something that should be evident in our day-to-day activities and interactions with others. And that philosophy is built into the culture of our organization. From how we compete for business and build relations with suppliers and customers, to how we behave as local stakeholders — rather than as foreigners — in the global societies and communities in which we operate .
Our reputation as an employer is directly connected to how we conduct our business at Kronos. And decades of good business practices have returned the rewards in many ways — earning us rankings as one of the Best Places to Work and exceptional Glassdoor ratings .
Philanthropy
Giving back is at the heart of our business. And is committed to providing ongoing support to charitable organizations and causes and that empower the next-generation workforce. Our GiveInspired initiatives make a direct impact by encouraging advancements in the math, science, technology, and engineering skills required of tomorrow’s workforce.
also provides support to the communities in which our company operates and where our employees live and work. Our philanthropic programs are globally inclusive but locally focused, supporting organizations and communities around the globe through grants, solicited donations, matching gifts, and volunteer opportunities.
Supporting our global and local communities has always been an integral part of the culture. We take great pride in being recognized as one of the Best Workplaces for Giving Back .

Prepare Yourself for the Future of Workforce Management
Prepare Yourself for the Future of Workforce Management
 explores how new technology platforms are transforming the workforce management market.
The way we work is changing, and the technology that helps you manage your workforce must keep up. Managers are required to make better decisions faster, and employees expect more from their workplace tools. Modern workforce management applications need to empower managers, enhance the employee experience, and support flexibility.
In this report, Gartner analysts advocate that organizations upgrade their workforce technology to a native cloud solution to gain access to next-generation capabilities and features that will better meet the needs of their changing workforce. These new innovations are game-changing for industries with a large proportion of hourly paid workers.
By 2023, at least 95 percent of sales of new workforce management applications will be deployed in the cloud.

 This comprehensive report explains how new technology platforms are evolving to a cloud-only future, supporting platforms to:
Be cloud-native, mobile-native, and data-driven in real time
Automate the manager experience with decision-making capabilities
Enhance the employee experience with consumer-grade apps and features
Easily extend and integrate with other systems
Download this Gartner research report now to learn more about how the future of workforce management is here — and why you need to adopt it today to keep pace.
