Environmental Vision 2050
formulated Environmental Vision 2050, the aim of which is to contribute to solving increasingly serious global environmental problems over the long term. With the aim of reducing to zero the CO
2
 emissions caused by our business activities and our products and services, we set targets and implement measures every five years under our Fusion strategic management plans.
We will reduce the CO
2
 emissions generated throughout the entire life cycle of our products.
Furthermore, we will create solutions that link society and customers as we work with stakeholders to reduce CO
2
 emissions to zero.
Using Ioand AI, and open solutions, we will meet the world's needs for air solutions by providing safe and healthy air environments while at the same time contributing to solving global environmental problems.

 Emissions
First Step Toward 2050
Formulating Environmental Vision 2050
Daikin's Philosophy on Zero CO
2
 Emissions
We aim to reduce CO
2
 emissions to zero by recovering and recycling refrigerants while at the same time creating products and solutions that minimize CO
2
.
First Step Toward 2050
We have already taken our first step toward our long-term goals for 2050 by beginning work on themes related to our environmental vision under the Fusion 20 Strategic Management Plan. 
Through products
Creation of products and services with high environmental performance
Promotion of energy efficiency through inverter and other technologies
Adoption of R-32 and other refrigerants with lower global warming potential, development of next-generation refrigerants, adoption of heat-pump heaters
Materials development, reduction of environmental impact throughout entire life cycle from material procurement to disposal and recycling
Through solutions
Creation of environmental solutions
Use of energy management to achieve optimal operation through a system that integrates air conditioners and their peripheral equipment, buildings, and renewable energy
Recovery and recycling of refrigerants in use on the market
Through the power of air
Creation of air value
Engineering of air environments that protect people's health from air pollutants such as PM2.5 and VOCs
Pursuit of value added in air through, for example, office environments conducive to high productivity and home environments that improve the quality of sleep
Formulating Environmental Vision 2050
We forecast what the world would be like in 2050 and came up with how should proceed toward this based on risks and opportunities.
Forecast of Society in Which Will Operate in 2050
Based on the relationship between Daikin's business and the global environment, we came up with a long-term environmental to-do list that takes into account what the world will be like for Daikin's business in 2050 judging by current social scenarios.
How Should Proceed Based on Risks and Opportunities
came up with business risks and opportunities in relation to the environmental problems specified above. 

                    We determined how we should proceed in order to solve these problems based on the company's resources.
