First Step Toward 2050
We have already taken our first step toward our long-term goals for 2050 by beginning work on themes related to our environmental vision under the Fusion 20 Strategic Management Plan. 
Through products
Creation of products and services with high environmental performance
Promotion of energy efficiency through inverter and other technologies
Adoption of R-32 and other refrigerants with lower global warming potential, development of next-generation refrigerants, adoption of heat-pump heaters
Materials development, reduction of environmental impact throughout entire life cycle from material procurement to disposal and recycling
Through solutions
Creation of environmental solutions
Use of energy management to achieve optimal operation through a system that integrates air conditioners and their peripheral equipment, buildings, and renewable energy
Recovery and recycling of refrigerants in use on the market
Through the power of air
Creation of air value
Engineering of air environments that protect people's health from air pollutants such as PM2.5 and VOCs
Pursuit of value added in air through, for example, office environments conducive to high productivity and home environments that improve the quality of sleep
Formulating Environmental Vision 2050
We forecast what the world would be like in 2050 and came up with how should proceed toward this based on risks and opportunities.
Forecast of Society in Which Will Operate in 2050
Based on the relationship between Daikin's business and the global environment, we came up with a long-term environmental to-do list that takes into account what the world will be like for Daikin's business in 2050 judging by current social scenarios.
How Should Proceed Based on Risks and Opportunities
came up with business risks and opportunities in relation to the environmental problems specified above.

What is
People-Centered
Management?
With belief in unlimited potential of people and based on the conviction that the source of a company’s competitiveness is its people and that the cumulative growth of each individual is the foundation of a company’s growth, People-Centered Management is a line of thinking which draws out the enthusiasm and understanding of the people who work in an organization to strengthen and raise the capabilities of the organization by having all members further refine their own individuality, achieve growth, and fully demonstrate their full potential.
This capitalizing on the diversity in the individualities and abilities possessed by each and every member as the strength of the organization is precisely the definition of diversity management.
As long as management is a human activity, a company cannot  be managed unless priority is placed on how to enhance the enthusiasm and understanding of people who work there. People-Centered Management is the tacit knowledge that our Group has nurtured since our foundation in making serious efforts to this.
Every business activity including strategy execution, various reforms, R&D, production, and sales is carried out by people who work in the company. Business management depends on the potential and individualities of the people who take action as well as the awareness with which they act. At the same time, people rejoice when they are happy, cry when they are sad, trust people at times, and distrust them at other times. While upholding enthusiasm and ambition to grow and succeed, people sometime fear failure and flinch at taking on a challenge in a new realm. These feelings and emotions are common to all people, regardless of nationality, race, or gender and transcend differences in culture, customs, and history.
If success of all corporate activities depends on such people, by believing in the potential of people that work there and drawing out enthusiasm and understanding to the fullest through work, people demonstrate their full individualities and capabilities and achieve growth. This should improve the quality of business activities and be the locomotive for the vitality of an organization as well as the growth and development of a company.
This is why Daikin’s manager have taken every chance to say, “One of the most important roles of management is to establish a worksite in which employees who were drawn together to join can feel the greatest, if not the only, fulfillment in life and an environment in which they can work with a vitality and a sense of purpose and demonstrate their full potential to achieve growth.” This is the line of thinking that serves as the foundation of People-Centered Management.
There is not a company in the world that does not place importance on people. By making efforts to this end with actual intent, we would like to make People-Centered Management one of the sources of competitive advantages of the Group.

About Why VRV
, Opening the New Era
VRV
 Changed the History of Air Conditioning
In the past, getting on a ship was the only way to travel overseas.
From time to time, new standards are born through innovations.
“Daikin’s development of 
VRV
”
*
VRV
 is a trademark of Industries, Ltd.
“Until the last person leaves, central  air conditioning could not be turned off”
In the past, central air conditioning was the only way to air condition the buildings.
1982
VRV
 - The Opening of the Era of New Air Conditioning Standard
developed 
VRV
, the world’s first multi-split type air conditioner for commercial buildings.
VRV
By air conditioning only occupied rooms, 
VRV
 ensures both “energy savings” and “comfort.”
“To achieve greater energy efficiency and comfort”
1986
Lower electric bills, greater comfort level
By using an inverter that operates with enhanced precise temperature control and efficiency, 
VRV
 air conditioner greatly cuts energy costs and realizes an even more comfortable environment.
“To adapt to diverse building layouts”
1990
The outdoor unit that is installable anywhere
developed the water-cooled 
VRV
 air conditioner. 
VRV
 enabled the outside unit to be paled indoors, and now can easily be installed even in high-rise buildings.
“To respond to diverse preferences at the same time”
1990
Those who are sensitive to temperature can be satisfied together
With heat recovery 
VRV
 air conditioner, simultaneous operation of heating and cooling with one outdoor unit became possible. realized enhanced comfort to buildings with diverse air conditioning needs, such as hotels, where people gather from all around the world.
“To have replacement done easily”
1999
Surprisingly quick replacement process
developed 
VRV
 air conditioner, which can be installed just by replacing indoor and outdoor units reusing existing refrigerant piping. This development reduces the time of installation and minimizes the impact on retail businesses, which often operate 24 hours a day.
“To spread the benefits of  life with 
VRV
”
1999
Bringing coolness to extremely hot regions
has brought 
VRV
 air conditioner to where outdoor temperatures rise to 50 °Centering on the Middle East, has spread 
VRV
 in this hot climate region.
2007
Bringing warmth to extremely cold regions
For severely cold environments which temperatures drop as low as -25 °C, developed a highly efficient heat pump type 
VRV
 air conditioner. expanded the experience of 
VRV
 to the extremely cold regions, where combustion heating prevailed.
“To achieve ultimate comfort”
2007
Controlling even humidity
As a result of multilaterally pursuing "more comfort", has enabled the control of humidity by 
VRV
 system with DESICA, heat pump desiccant.
What created was an ultimately new type of air conditioning.
Today, it has become one of the two types of
will always be the pioneer of air conditioning and continue to expand this new standard, from building to building, around the world.

Use Air- and Environment-related Technologies to Realize Both Solutions to Social Issues and Business Growth
Masanori Togawa
President and CEO
Industries, Ltd.
Fiscal 2016 was the first year of Daikin’s Fusion 20 strategic management plan to fiscal 2020. It was a year in which we made a strong start towards the plan’s targets as we implement measures towards future growth including the establishment of a new production base in the key market and acquisitions of companies that will expand our filter business.
Reducing Environmental Impact through Energy-efficient Air Conditioners
Air conditioners-Daikin's main product-were originally invented in the early 20th century and they went on to spur a revolution in labor and lifestyles in hot regions while contributing to economic growth and a better quality of life. But the proliferation of air conditioners has led to higher electricity consumption and contributed to environmental problems, in particular climate change.
has strived to solve these problems by reducing the environmental impact of air conditioners through the worldwide adoption of products using energy-efficient inverter technology and HFC-32, a refrigerant with low global warming potential. Since their market introduction in 2012, HFC-32 air conditioners have sold 10 million units worldwide and, combined with inverter technology, have contributed to a reduction of 45 million tons-CO2. This is equivalent to half the amount of CO2 emitted by passenger cars in Japan in one year.
Providing New Value through Technology
Under our Fusion 20 strategic management plan, we are focusing on not only reducing the environmental impact of air conditioning but also on revolutionizing new technologies that create new value in air conditioning. Besides providing systems that give greater energy efficiency throughout entire buildings and cities, we are creating new value in the form of health and comfort for people and space by, for example, removing pollutants from the air and providing room air that improves people’s concentration and helps them recover from fatigue faster.
At the TIC, Technology and Innovation Center, the hub of our research and development efforts, we energize our R&through collaboration with numerous outside organizations. We are taking on new research themes related to people and the air around them; for example, research into air and space that raises intellectual productivity and research into using scientific technologies to give on-screen data that shows how air environments effect on human health.
With our new production base in the now operating, we will minimize our environmental impact and provide products geared to the needs of the North American market. Similarly, we will use facilities such as our North America R&center and our Silicon Valley technology office to integrate air conditioners with state-of-the-art Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies with the goal of creating new value for our customers.
Workplace Where Diverse Human Resources Can Flourish
Creating new value in the field of air conditioning comes down to each one of our 67,000 employees worldwide. The Group positions People-Centered Management as the source of its competitive strength. We pursue diversity management to give diverse human resources an opportunity to flourish, and to this end we strive to build workplaces where employees can maximize their potential. The air conditioning market is expected to expand in countries like Thailand and India, With this in mind, we are fostering the human resources who will drive air conditioner adoption in these countries by providing technology education to students and other young people.
takes part in the United Nations Global Compact, an initiative to promote the implementation of 10 universally accepted principles in the four areas of human rights, labor, the environment, and anti-corruption. We also do everything possible to ensure that our activities are sound, transparent, and ethical throughout the entire value chain.
As a corporate group that co-creates new value in the air and environment fields, we will meet the expectations of customers, shareholders, procurement business partners, community members, and all of our other stakeholders as we provide society with solutions and grow our business.

This Group Philosophy was thus formulated as a fundamental mindset of our management for everyone in the Group to hold in common.
Future management policies and plans formulated by or individual Group companies will be made in accordance with this Group Philosophy. At the same time, would like all members of the Group to refer to this Group Philosophy as the basis for judgments or decisions in the course of their work.
When all Group members display their vibrant personalities and take flexible actions with this Group Philosophy in mind, am confident that our valued tradition of Fast & Flat Management will be further enhanced, bringing us substantially closer to realizing our goal of becoming a Global and Truly First-Class Company.
With a foundation based on our three key corporate principles of "Absolute Credibility," "Enterprising Management," and "Harmonious Personal Relations," as well as this Group Philosophy, let us continue evolving both individually by challenging ourselves to accomplish our ambitious goals believing in our infinite potential, and together by striving to become an overwhelmingly first-class global corporate group-a group in which employees can have pride and enthusiasm.
August 2002
Noriyuki Inoue
Industries, Ltd.
1. Create New Value by Anticipating the Future Needs of Customers
Our mission, and the essence of our existence, is to identify and realize our customers' future needs and dreams, even those that they themselves may not yet be aware of. We can accomplish this goal by paying careful attention to changes in social trends and conducting extensive marketing to win the hearts and minds of customers. It is essential that we offer customers optimum convenience and comfort that are always one step ahead of our competitors by providing customers with the highest quality products, materials, and services for which we, as a manufacturer, will be absolutely responsible. Moreover, we will continue offering products and services that provide customers with fresh excitement and continued enjoyment.
We furthermore believe that these activities are an important source of increased profit and business expansion for the Group.
2. Contribute to Society with World-Leading Technologies
In any era in any business field, a company can grow and develop only if it possesses world-leading technologies.
Along with increasing our market share and creating new markets, we must devote ourselves to strengthening our technological foundation since this enables us to continuously launch highly differentiated products, high value-added products, solutions-type products, and products with new applications through which we can make contributions to society.
While refining our core technologies to a level of dominant superiority, we must also adopt technologies that are cutting-edge, as well as of the highest world standard, and integrate them with Daikin's own technologies in order to establish the "Technology" recognized throughout the world.
3. Realize Future Dreams by Maximizing Corporate Value
We must strive to maximize our corporate value by thoroughly implementing management based on the mandates of capitalist philosophy.
Enhanced corporate value offers us a greater range of management options, enabling us to realize new growth and making possible the establishment of a stable yet flexible management foundation. Moreover, enhanced corporate value provides increased investment opportunities through which to realize our future dreams.
Enhanced corporate value unquestionably responds to the expectations held by our shareholders by providing them with stable dividends. It can also benefit other stakeholders not only by providing our customers with leading-edge products and solutions made possible through enriched research and development, but also by making contributions to the local communities in which we are based. We firmly believe that enhanced corporate value especially leads to our employees and their families enjoying more stable and fulfilling lives.
4. Think and Act Globally
Daikin's history has been one of continual global business expansion. As a multinational company group that is substantially expanding its operations in every region of the world, including Japan, we must propose, examine, and then implement strategies and policies from a global point of view.
Therefore, we aim to systematically foster human resources appropriate to the particular characteristics of each country and region; promote the appointment of local human resources who understand Daikin's philosophy, traditions and culture, and who can play a part in Group management; and promote exchanges of human resources regardless of company or country.
5. Be a Flexible and Dynamic Group
1) Flexible Group Harmony
By thoroughly promoting information sharing and the transfer of know-how throughout the Group, individual Group companies must strive to develop and expand their respective business operations, thereby enabling the entire Group to enjoy synergetic effects.
The specific roles of and the individual Group companies are not fixed. These roles can be changed or adapted to flexibly respond to the particular circumstances of the times and the characteristics of the individual Group companies.
With this as a premise and the Group Philosophy and policies as a base, Group companies must contribute to the development of the entire Group by aligning their visions and enhancing their individual capabilities, while fulfilling their own roles and responsibilities and introducing new proposals.
Moreover, individual Group companies know best about the conditions particular to each country and region. Based on our fundamental Group policy, each Group company is expected to demonstrate autonomy and flexible action by promoting two-way communication between themselves and through information sharing about their specific business fronts.
2) Build Friendly yet Competitive Relations with Our Business Partners to Achieve Mutual Benefit
We must build friendly yet tense competitive relations with all our business associates and alliance partners in all areas of management, including research, production, and sales. Such relations involve a high degree of trust in which parties motivate each other toward improvement and, from within their own roles, fulfill each other's expectations so that all parties can grow and develop together.
6. Be a Company that Leads in Applying Environmentally Friendly Practices
As we continue developing our business operations in various fields, it is our mission to proactively develop initiatives to respond to environmental issues. Incorporating environmental initiatives throughout our management must be a priority for us.
In all aspects of our business operations, including product development, manufacturing, and sales, we need to formulate initiatives that sustain and improve the environment. Meanwhile, we need to promote the development of new products and the innovation of technologies that will lead to a more environmentally healthy world.
Under the precept "environmental response is an important management resource," we must integrate environmental initiatives into our corporate management since they can lead to business expansion, improved business performance, and further enhancement of our credibility with outside parties. We intend to continue being a leading company in the practice of "environmental management," thus contributing to a healthier global environment as a good citizen of the earth.
7. With Our Relationship with Society in Mind, Take Action and Earn Society's Trust
1) Be Open, Fair, and Known to Society
In each country we operate, we must strive to respect its customs while transferring and establishing our know-how. In addition to observing all applicable laws and regulations in each country, we aim to take action based on a high standard of ethics and to conduct our business operations based on principles of fair competition. Moreover, we strive to enhance our accountability and the timely and appropriate disclosure of information.
Furthermore, we will actively disseminate outside the company information on our activities so that our management policies, positions, and corporate culture are fully understood, thereby enabling our Group to further earn society's respect.
2) Make Contributions that Are Unique to to Local Communities
Corporations bear a societal responsibility to contribute to the development of local and economies through the expansion of their business operations. This is a responsibility we take seriously and one that we intend to fulfill.
Moreover, we aim to make beneficial contributions that are unique to the Group to each community in which we are based by being highly receptive to its needs, thus further earning society's appreciation and affection.
8. The Pride and Enthusiasm of Each Employee Are the Driving Forces of Our Group
1) The Cumulative Growth of All Group Members Serves as the Foundation for the Group's Development
As we aim to develop globally, it is imperative that each member of the Group continues to develop his or her capabilities and qualities through individual effort and takes flexible actions based firmly on the principle of self-responsibility. All our members are expected to play leading roles in the course of their work.
Each Group company and the individuals who work there are drawn together by mutual preference. The relationship between the company and its employees involves both mutual trust and responsibility, in which the company offers individuals opportunities to develop professionally while individuals endeavor to fulfill their work responsibilities for the company. With this in mind, the kinds of individuals needs are those who display sound judgment and decision-making capabilities and are capable of proposing and carrying out creative ideas and measures irrespective of past successes or failures. These individuals shall be rewarded based on their performance through a compensation system based upon the principle of "fairness of opportunity and reward."
2) Pride and Loyalty
Because employees spend a large part of their lives at the company, having clear goals and the passion to apply themselves to their jobs are key factors for fulfillment in life. While respecting diverse personal values and work ethics, we must create a work environment that enables employees to feel both pride and enthusiasm toward their work.
Furthermore, as long as they are employees of the Group, individuals are required to display company loyalty by adhering to Group company policies and the Group Philosophy as well as by working together in pursuit of established goals. In turn, the company strives to provide stable employment for those employees who contribute to the company's growth and development and who wish to continue working for the company, as well as increased opportunities for those who wish to join us in working for Daikin.
3) Passion and Perseverance
However good a company's policy or strategy, ultimate success depends on taking action in a swift and timely manner, responding flexibly to change, and staying a half step ahead of society's advances.
culture of "continuous action" must be fostered throughout the Group, where it is understood and accepted that policies and strategies must be turned into action plans that produce results within set time frames.
The capacity to take such bold actions comes from three sources: an ambition in one's work, the passion to realize that ambition, and the perseverance to succeed in the face of adversity. Therefore, we must strive to be a Group in which each member expresses his or her ambitions and then takes bold actions with great passion and perseverance to realize those ambitions.
9. Be Recognized Worldwide by Optimally Managing the Organization and its Human Resources, under Our Fast & Flat Management System
1) Participate, Understand, and Act
We aim to gather the wisdom of all Group members through timely information sharing and by holding vigorous discussions where people are able to openly express their opinions, thereby gaining an understanding of all aspects of a situation. After reaching a decision made by a leader, we then must strive as a team to accomplish the established goals.
To accomplish our objectives, at times we must display flexibility in creating optimal organizational structures, including the concept of "core person and supporters." Moreover, we must establish and implement our Fast & Flat Management system, in which employees not only take orders from superiors but also take flexible action themselves respective of their roles and responsibilities. Employees will then be able to maximize their potential to swiftly attain results by utilizing information independently gathered from their own established networks. We will continue comprehensively implementing this management style throughout the entire Group until it is recognized worldwide as one of Daikin's unique strengths.
2) Offer Increased Opportunities to Those who Take on Challenges
We will continue to be a Group that has a strong desire to take on new challenges.
These challenges include boldly establishing overwhelming advantages in our existing businesses, expanding into new business fields, and undertaking management reform. We strive to be a Group that eagerly takes on various challenges to achieve short-, medium-, and long-term growth in the form of new business opportunities and themes.
People experience growth when they continuously challenge themselves to accomplish ambitious and seemingly impossible goals without the fear of failure. We support employees who ambitiously take on challenges and offer increased opportunities to those who contribute to the company with their enthusiasm and professional skills.
3) Demonstrate Our Strength as a Team Composed of Diverse Professionals
We must establish an increasingly diversified employment system and actively recruit a variety of human resources from both inside and outside the company. Each employee strives to demonstrate his or her professional skills and expertise on the job. Through flexible management of the organization, such as workgroups that form and re-form as needed, these skills and expertise strengthen and unify the team to accomplish the established goals.
As a Group, we must display teamwork in challenging ourselves to accomplish our ambitious goals. By sharing in the joy and satisfaction of attaining these goals, we can then become a Group abundant in truly "harmonious personal relationships."
10. An Atmosphere of Freedom, Boldness, and "Best Practice, Our Way"
has many valued traditions and customs. These include an atmosphere in which people can freely express themselves, the boldness to take action in the face of adversity, the consideration we show our customers, and our unique customer-oriented management. We are also proud of our principle of "Best Practice, Our Way." Through this principle we are able to develop flexibly structured measures that are one or even half a step ahead of society by perceiving changes in social trends to use our strengths and the particular circumstances to our advantage.
We will continue upholding our valued traditions and culture, refining them over time to be strengths recognized throughout the world. We intend to continue evolving as a dynamic Group that is trusted by customers around the world and where people are proud to work.

Terms of UseHistory of Innovation
Behind its steady growth were two conditions unique to Japan -
“the diverse climate that gives rise to distinct four seasons” and “limited resources.”
Honed in a severe environment known as “Japan,”
the pursuit for high quality air conditioners that meet various user needs and
great attention to details from developing to manufacturing proudly made
Daikin’s air conditioning technology the world’s top class.
Country of Diverse
Four Seasons - Japan
Located to the east of the Asian Continent, Japan has distinct four seasons: spring, summer, autumn and winter.
Japan is an island country that spreads wide, north to south, surrounded by sea.  Hokkaido in the north is in a subarctic zone with temperatures dropping far below zero degrees in the winters, whereas Okinawa in the south is in a subtropical zone with high temperatures all year round. Moreover, climate differs greatly depending on whether you are on the side of the Pacific Ocean or the Sea of Japan and in different regions.
air conditioners have evolved in response to such diverse climate.
Climate
March-May
Spring in Japan is a time when beautiful new green leaves sprout and cherry trees as well as flowers of various colors blossom.       The temperature gradually rises after the cherry blossoms bloom in the end of March.  The climate is mild and comfortable this time of the year.
Climate
June-August
In many places, temperatures rise above 30°in the daytime.  With moist air coming in from the south, humidity level rises and people feel the temperature higher than the actual temperature.
Therefore, people in Japan required dehumidification functionality in addition to cooling. With this, the humid and unpleasant summer season became comfortable.
Climate
September-November
After the summer heat cools down, you begin to feel chilliness in the mornings and nights.  We welcome the season of autumn leaves and harvesting.
We can enjoy the beauty of the clear sky and the brilliant red and yellow foliage.
Climate
December-February
On top of severely cold temperatures, heavy snow can be experienced in the winter. Due to the seasonal wind, the Sea of Japan side will be covered with snow, while the Pacific Ocean side becomes dry.
In order to overcome the severe and dry winter weather, air conditioners were required to humidify while powerfully heating the room.

Energy Saving Technologies Originated from Resource Limited Country, Japan
Japan depends on other countries for energy supply, due to its limited resources.  As a result, Japanese manufacturing has achieved high environmental performance, by focusing on fuel consumption in automobiles and energy consumption in household electronics.

Energy Saving through Inverter Technology
An inverter is an energy saving technology that eliminates wasteful operation in the air conditioning by efficiently controlling the motor speed.
When compared to non-inverter air conditioners, inverter air conditioners consume approximately 30% less energy.
Japan’s diverse climate and limited resources led to the birth of technologies, a Japan Brand.
will continue to deliver to the world these technologies for people of
various countries to live their daily lives more comfortably.To use all available functions on this website, JavaScript must be enabled in your browser.
